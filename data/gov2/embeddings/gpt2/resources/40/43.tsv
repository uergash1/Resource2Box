Also, some studies in people suggest that these drugs may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.   55   </p>  56   <p>  57   However, researchers at UCSF and the University of Michigan have determined in a recent study that aspirin is not a cost-effective addition to the national strategy for reducing death from colorectal cancer.   58   </p>  59   <p>  60   ""While aspirin may be of some benefit in colorectal cancer prevention, it should not replace known screening methods,"" said Uri Ladabaum, MD, MS, UCSF assistant professor of gastroenterology and lead author of the study, which appears in the November 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. ""In addition, in terms of cost and benefits, it does not make sense for patients already getting regular screening to take aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer. Screening is highly cost-effective and remains so, even in patients already taking aspirin for other reasons like arthritis or prevention of heart disease.""   61   </p>  62   <p>  63   Screening tests, including flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years and yearly fecal occult blood testing (FS/FOBT) or screening colonoscopy every ten years (COLO), remain the best strategies for preventing death from colorectal cancer in men and women, according to the researchers.   64   </p>  65   <p>  66   Though colorectal cancer screening is highly effective, less than half of the population seek it, said Mark Fendrick, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of Michigan and a co-investigator on the study.

However, all the innovative solutions in the world will >accomplish little if the injustices they address or the problems they solve >have been shoved aside because plutocracy reigns and democracy wanes.

In the early 1970s, our economy split into two tiers. >Whereas once economic growth broadly benefited the majority, now the economy >has become one wherein ""a rising tide lifts all yachts,"" in the words of Jeff >Gates, author of The Ownership Solution. Returns on capital outpaced returns >on labor, and job insecurity increased for millions of seasoned workers.

Are we able to end homelessness and wretched housing conditions >with modern materials, designs, and financing mechanisms, without bank and >insurance company redlining, to meet the affordable housing needs of millions >of Americans?  > >        d.. Are we getting the best out of known ways to spread renewable, >efficient energy throughout the land to save consumers money and to head off >global warming and other land-based environmental damage from fossil fuels >and atomic energy?  > >        e.. Are we getting the best out of the many bright and >public-spirited civil servants who know how to improve governments but are >rarely asked by their politically-appointed superiors or members of Congress? > >        f.. Are we able to provide wide access to justice for all aggrieved >people so that we apply rigorously the admonition of Judge Learned Hand, ""If >we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: Thou Shall Not >Ration Justice""?  > >        g.. Can we extend overseas the best examples of our country's >democratic processes and achievements instead of annually using billions in >tax dollars to subsidize corporate munitions exports, as Republican Senator >Mark Hatfield always used to decry?  > >        h.. Can we stop the giveaways of our vast commonwealth assets and >become better stewards of the public lands, better investors of trillions of >dollars in worker pension monies, and allow broader access to the public >airwaves and other assets now owned by the people but controlled by >corporations?  > >        i.. Can we counter the coarse and brazen commercial culture, >including television which daily highlights depravity and ignores the quiet >civic heroisms in its communities, a commercialism that insidiously exploits >childhood and plasters its logos everywhere?  > >        j.. Can we plan ahead as a society so we know our priorities and >where we wish to go?

Comprehensive reform proposals from the >corporate suites to the nation's streets, from the schools to the hospitals, >from the preservation of small farm economies to the protection of privacies, >from livable wages to sustainable environments, from more time for children >to less time for commercialism, from waging peace and health to averting war >and violence, from foreseeing and forestalling future troubles to journeying >toward brighter horizons, will wither while power inequalities loom over us.  > >      Why are campaigns just for candidates?

GX240-68-12418640	"Radio Controlled Clocks Speaker/Author: Michael A. Lombardi National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division Boulder, Colorado 80305 Email: lombardi@boulder.nist.gov Phone: (303) 497-3212; Fax: (303) 497-3228 Abstract controlled clocks have existed for decades, but have become far more common in the States in recent years, due mainly to the explosion of new products that receive time from NIST radio station WWVB. This paper explores the history of radio controlled how they work, and the types of radio signals that control them.  Radio United signals clocks,  1. Introduction The next time someone asks the age old question of ""What time is it?"", you can give them the exact answer, provided that you own a radio controlled clock (RCC). These clocks receive wireless time codes and synchronize to within a fraction of a second of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Some manufacturers refer to their radio controlled clocks as ""atomic clocks"", but that description isn't true. A real atomic clock has an atomic oscillator inside (such as a cesium or rubidium oscillator). A RCC has a radio inside, which receives a signal sent from a place where an atomic clock is located. And as we shall see, radio clocks existed long before atomic clocks were invented. Radio time signals were referenced to pendulum clocks, and later quartz clocks, before atomic clocks became reliable standards in the 1960s. In one form or another, RCCs have been with us for nearly a century, but they were not made available to the average consumer until recently. Until the latter part of the 1990's, most RCCs were expensive instruments designed for laboratory applications, or kits assembled by technically minded hobbyists. Now, low-cost RCCs are available everywhere, in the form of wall clocks, desk clocks, and wristwatches that synchronize to NIST radio station WWVB, or to similar stations in other countries. Other RCCs are embedded inside consumer electronic products such as cell phones, televisions, pagers, and car radios. This recent proliferation of RCCs represents one of the most significant developments in the history of timekeeping. In the not too distant future every clock that we look at might be synchronized to the correct time, a prospect that would have once seemed impossible. 2. The history of radio controlled clocks It might surprise you to know that the concept of a radio controlled clock is nearly as old as the concept of radio itself. In fact, shortly after it was discovered that information could be sent by wireless transmissions, early radio scientists began looking for ways to send the time by radio from one location to another. Most historians cite the experiments of the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi as the first radio broadcasts. Marconi's scientific breakthroughs are well documented and widely known. Born in 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 1   1874, Marconi used a spark-gap transmitter and antenna to successfully send radio signals over a distance of over 2 km in 1895. By 1899 he had established wireless communications between France and England across the English channel, and in 1901, sent the first wireless signals across the Atlantic ocean. What is not widely known is that in the midst of Marconi's early work, a proposal was made to use the new wireless medium for the broadcast of time signals. In a talk given to the Royal Dublin Society in November 1898, the optical instrument maker and engineer Sir Howard Grubb first proposed the concept of a radio controlled clock [1]. Shortly after his talk, he published the following comments in the Society's proceedings: There is something very beautiful in this action of the ""Marconi"" wave. In a city supplied with this apparatus we should be conscious as we hear each hour strike that above us and around us, swiftly and silently, this electrical wave is passing, conscientiously doing its work, and setting each clock in each establishment absolutely right, without any physical connection whatsoever between the central distributing clock, and those which it keeps correct by means of this mysterious electrical wave. We might go even still further, and although likely to be carried out in any way, except as be perfectly possible to carry an apparatus automatically set by this electrical wave as we I do not put it forward as a proposition an experiment, yet it undoubtedly would in one's pocket, and have our watches walk about the streets [2].  Grubb's comments are remarkable because they predicted the radio controlled watch nearly 100 years before it finally appeared in 1990, and because they were made while the first radio experiments were still being conducted! You might find it interesting that he predicted a pocket watch rather than a wristwatch. This makes some sense when you consider that the first wristwatches for men did not appear until a few years later, although Cartier (and perhaps others) were producing lady's wristwatches in France at the time of Grubb's presentation. 2.1 Early Time Signal Broadcast Stations Grubb's idea of a ""central distributing clock"" already existed at the time of his 1898 talk, since time signals were already being distributed via telegraph and other means prior to the invention of radio. When the first wireless time signals were introduced a few years later, the telegraph was sometimes used to send time from the reference clock to the broadcasting station. The first radio time signal is believed to have been broadcast in 1903 by the United States Navy, using a clock located at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) site in Washington, DC. At least one source lists the first transmission site as Navesink, New Jersey [3], but regularly scheduled broadcasts apparently began on August 9, 1904 from the Navy Yard in Boston [4]. Within a few years, the Navy had sent time signals from a number of other sites, including Washington, New York, Norfolk, Newport, Cape Cod, and Arlington, Virginia, on the other side of the Potomac River from Washington. The first radio time signal outside the United States might have come from station VCS in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Broadcasts there began in 1907, referenced to the clock at St. John's Observatory [5]. More widely used time signal broadcasts began shortly afterwards. Beginning in 1910, the French Bureau of Longitudes broadcast time signals twice daily from a station installed at the top of the Eiffel Tower. The reference clocks were located at the nearby Paris Observatory, and the wavelength of the transmissions was 2000 m. The station, with the call letters FL, was intended 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 2   to allow ships at sea to correct their marine chronometers. However, it quickly attracted a great demand from railway companies, clock makers, jewelers, and others, who began to decode the signals and obtain the correct time. By 1913, the broadcast wavelength had been changed to 2500 m, and the format had been standardized [6]. Figure 1 shows a chart used by early radio operators to decode the broadcast and obtain the time. It is interesting to note that radio time signals probably saved the Eiffel Tower, now one of the world's most famous monuments, from demolition. Then the world's tallest structure, the 312 m tall tower was built for the 1889 International Exhibition of Paris that commemorated the centenary of the French Revolution. Many had opposed its construction, and after it was built it was unpopular with Parisians, Figure 1. Signal Chart for the Eiffel Tower Time Code. who considered it unsightly. As a result, it was scheduled for demolition in 1909 at the expiration of its 20 year lease. By then, however, experimental radio time signals were already being broadcast, and the monument was spared due to its usefulness as a radio tower. The first well known American time signal came from radio station NAA, located in Arlington, Virginia. NAA began broadcasting time signals in Morse Code in 1913 using a rotary spark-gap transmitter at a wavelength of 2500 m and an output power of about 54 kW [7]. The time came from a USNO clock, and it was said that the time sent from Arlington was accurate to ""1/20 of a second"" when it reached San Francisco. Figure 2 shows an early NAA operator at the controls [8]. Today, the NAA call letters are assigned to a station used for submarine communication that broadcasts from Cutler, Maine. Figure 2. NAA Time Signal Operator.  Another famous radio time signal began in 1924, the ""six-pip"" system of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in London. 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 3   The first 5 ""pips"" were audio tones that counted down the seconds to the sixth ""pip"". Once known as the Greenwich Time Signal, the ""pips"" can still be heard on BBC programs today [9]. NIST (then called the National Bureau of Standards, or NBS) began experimental broadcasts from station WWV in Washington, DC in 1920, and began continuous operations in 1923. The station, now located in Fort Collins, Colorado, broadcasts time signals on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz, and remains the world's best known shortwave time signal. A similar station, WWVH, began operation in Hawaii in 1948. In its early days, WWV was used primarily as a frequency reference so that other radio broadcasters could calibrate their transmitters. Second markers were added to the broadcast in 1937, but a telegraphic time code was not added until 1945 [10]. The early stations sent time markers according to a known schedule, in some form of telegraphic code. For example, if a marker was sent at 10 a.m. Paris time, clocks could be synchronized to 10 a.m. when the marker was received. There was some sequence of coded signals that counted down to the time marker. Full digital time codes modulated on to a continuous wave carrier, and containing the hour, minute, second, and date did not appear until much later. In the United States, digital time codes began on WWV in 1960, on WWVH in 1971, and on WWVB in 1965. 2.1 Today's Time Signal Broadcast Stations Most of today's RCCs receive signals located in a part of the radio spectrum called LF, which stands for low frequency. The LF spectrum covers the region from 30 to 300 kHz, but all of today's time signal stations are found in the 40 to 80 kHz range. This the same part of the spectrum used by the very early time signal stations, such as FT and NAA. Low frequency is an appropriate name, and few devices other than RCCs now receive signals broadcast in this region. To put these frequencies into perspective, consider that everyday items such as FM radios and televisions receive frequencies that are thousands of times higher, and that cell phones, satellite TV receivers, and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers are designed for frequencies that exceed 1 GHz. Although LF communications isn't exactly a modern technology, it remains perfectly suited for RCC applications, where only a small amount of information needs to be sent, and very little bandwidth is required. Sometimes called longwave stations (the 60 kHz wavelength is 5 km, or more than 3 miles), LF signals can cover a wide area with relatively low power and can be received indoors, since their signals can easily pass through non-metallic buildings and walls. This gives them an advantage for RCC applications over line-of-sight receivers that require an outdoor antenna, such as GPS. Table 1 lists the time signal stations in the LF region that are most often used for RCC applications. All of the stations broadcast UTC time signals traceable to the national standard in their respective country. These stations broadcast digital time codes that contain the hour, minute, second, and date. The rightmost column in the table shows when the first digital time code became available, although several of these stations were on the air before then (for example, WWVB began as an experimental standard frequency station in 1956) [10]. And although each of the stations uses a different time code format, many RCCs now are designed to work with more than one station, since the carrier frequencies and modulation schemes are similar.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  4   Call Letters WWVB  MSF  DCF77  JJY  BPC  Table 1.

The earliest products received time signals from sources such as the Eiffel Tower, which needed to be manually decoded. One early product was The Horophone, invented by Frank Hope-Jones (who later helped create the BBC ""six-pip"" system mentioned earlier), and offered for sale in 1913 by the Synchronome Company, Ltd. in London. An advertisement is shown in Figure 3 [11], and a photograph in Figure 4. The user of this product would listen to the time signals using headphones, and use a chart (such as the one shown in Figure 1) to decode the time signals and manually set a local clock. At least several other companies sold products of this type, including the company founded by Marconi. 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  Figure 3. Advertisement for The Horophone  5   2.2 Semi-automatic radio controlled clocks There is no true consensus on who invented the first RCC that could synchronize to a wireless signal, and that could then continue to receive the signal to stay on time. Since there were digital time codes in the early days, it was not possible for a clock to automatically set itself; it needed a human operator to put it near the correct time prior to the arrival of a time marker. Once the marker was received, the clock would synchronize, and then regulate its frequency (and make time corrections) as further time markers were received. Before the advent of modern electronics, building such a device was a daunting task. Even so, it seems clear that semi-automatic RCCs clocks existed for decades before any were sold commercially. Perhaps the first record of such a device came from London in 1912, when amazingly, F. O. Read of London claimed to have controlled a clock's time by wireless. An article in the Daily Sketch of October 4, 1912 (Figure 5) contained the following text: Figure 4. The Horophone. Mr. F. O. Read, a Londoner, has nearly perfected his system by which it will be possible to control all our clocks and watches by wireless power. Mr. Read has already established a complete system of wireless clocks at his private residence, and is convinced that before very long the present day clocks, with their complicated mechanism, will be scrapped, and that all the timepieces of the world will be regulated from one centre [12].  Figure 5. 1912 news story about F. O. Read.  Read went on to claim horological patents, but it is not known whether his wireless clock still exists or how it actually worked. Two other candidates for the inventor of the RCC are Marius Lavet and Alfred Ball. Lavet, a French horologist, worked on RCC designs throughout the 1920's (a sample design is in Figure 6), but apparently none went into production [13]. Lavet received many patents in the field of electrical timekeeping and became quite wealthy; he was eventually a key contributor to the development of the first quartz wrist watch. The English clockmaker Alfred Ball began experimenting with wireless control of electric clocks in 1914. He devoted the rest of his life to this research, which was incomplete when he died in 1932. He published a series of articles in the Horological Journal entitled ""The Automatic Synchronisation of Clocks and Wireless Waves"" from 1928 until his death [14]. Ball's work centered around the use of a master clock 6  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium   Pul-Syn-Etic system which he had helped patent and invent. The Pul-Syn-Etic was a device that was used to synchronize the dials of other slave clocks. Ball designed an apparatus, consisting of a number of valves, relays and gears, that received the ""6-pip"" Greenwich time signal broadcast from Daventry, and used the impulses from the broadcast both to set the hands on time, and to regulate the speed of the pendulum. He wrote in 1928 that ""the installation has operated without any attention whatever for the last six months, and the maximum error recorded has not exceeded one second fast or slow"" [15]. There is no record that this Figure 6. One of Lavet's Early RCC Designs. system was ever sold commercially, but pre-production models with clock faces marked ""Auto Controlled by Wireless from Daventry"" were built [16]. In 1930, Roters and Paulding of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey published an account of an RCC designed to synchronize to signals from NAA, which was then broadcasting time markers on 112 kHz. The paper credits T. S. Casner of the Radio Electric Clock Corporation for the ""broad work and many of the elements of the system"", so this clock was probably intended for production, but it is not known if any were sold. The receiver converted the NAA time signals sent between 11:55 a.m. and noon to current pulses used to drive the clock mechanism. The operator had to assist in the initial synchronization by turning the clock on and adjusting the display prior to the arrival of the time signal. However, after the clock was initially synchronized, a magnetic selector was used four times daily to detect the pulses, and make time corrections if necessary by adjusting the gears. The authors identified ""static"" as a problem, but noted that it was ""almost impossible"" to set the clock incorrectly, and that the maximum error would be 0.5 s [17]. The first semi-automatic RCC intended for consumer use in the United States with a NIST time signal might have been the IBM Type 37 Radio Supervised Time Control Clock, manufactured in 1956, designed for reception of the WWV/WWVH telegraphic time code (although it seems likely that other models were sold commercially or built for the military between 1945, when the telegraphic time code began, and 1956). Housed in a large wooden cabinet with a pendulum, it has the appearance of a grandfather 7  Figure 7. IBM Type 37 Clock.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium   clock. One of these devices is on display at the NIST laboratories in Boulder, Colorado (Figure 7). A patent for a WWV/WWVH radio controlled clock was issued at about this same time to Theodore R. Gilliland, who had formerly worked for NBS. Gilliland received a patent in 1958 (applied for in 1956) entitled Automatic Radio Control for Clocks [18]. Gilliland's invention was an interesting combination of mechanical and electrical parts, and appears to be similar to the IBM design, but it is not known whether the two were related. 2.2 Automatic radio controlled clocks Automatic RCCs that could ""recover"" time and date from the radio signal and synchronize their displays without any human interaction, first became possible in the United States when digital time codes appeared. Since WWV was the first NIST station to send a digital time code, it seems likely that the first product of this type was a WWV clock. A variety of WWV/WWVH RCCs appeared over the years, including even some gear driven analog wall clocks, but none were well suited for widespread consumer use. The receivers were more complex and larger than those inside the WWVB clocks that came later, and it was difficult to decode the time using an indoor antenna and a low-cost receiver. There was also the problem of choosing the best Figure 8. Heath ""Most Accurate Clock"" frequency to use for a given area, since the shortwave stations broadcast the same time code on multiple frequencies. Perhaps the most common example of a WWV/WWVH RCC was the Heath GC-1000 Most Accurate Clock, sold both in kit form and as an assembled product from about 1986 to 1995. This device, which looked similar to a digital clock radio (Figure 8), looked for the time code on three different frequencies (5, 10, and 15 MHz) and attracted a following among hobbyists. Even so, it was far more expensive (about $400) and less likely to synchronize reliably than the WWVB products sold today. Laboratory type receivers for the LF signals appeared in both the United States and Europe during the 1960s and 1970s, shortly after the first modern LF time codes originated (Table 1). There were also numerous articles written during this period for hobbyists about decoding LF time signals in magazines such as Radio Electronics and Wireless World, and some receivers were sold in kit form. However, the first consumer oriented RCCs that received LF radio signals are believed to be the Kundo Space Timer and the Junghans RC-1, both of which debuted around 1986 with analog only displays [19]. Various versions of these clocks were produced to receive both the DCF77 and MSF signals. The first radio controlled wrist watch is believed to be the Junghans MEGA 1, which debuted in 1990, an introduction that was hailed by one reviewer as ""one of the most momentous horological events ever"". This digital watch synchronized to signals from station DCF77 in Germany [20]. Figure 9 shows the watch and its internal clockwork, including the antenna embedded inside the wrist band.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  8   WWVB consumer oriented RCCs were relatively rare until 1999, when NIST increased the radiated output power of the station to 50 kW [21], a move that allowed the signal to reach all of the United States. Since then, the availability of WWVB products has continued to go up, the prices continue to go down, and the general public is gradually becoming aware that low cost clocks are available that always display the correct time. At this writing (April 2003), wall clocks are available for as little as $10, and wrist watches for less than $30. A collection of models is shown in Figure 10. The first products sold in the United States came primarily from Europe, modified versions of products originally designed to receive signals from DCF77 or MSF. Today, however, many products are designed specifically for the United States marketplace, and others are truly international products, capable of working with one or more stations. The number of WWVB RCCs sold now numbers in the millions. Several timepiece manufacturers have projected that sales of RCCs will exceed 20 million units in 2003, with about 10% of these units sold to the United States marketplace for WWVB reception. This number is expected to reach 80 million units per year in 3 to 5 years, with approximately one-third of these sales designed for WWVB.  Figure 9. Junghans MEGA 1  Figure 10. A collection of low-cost radio controlled clocks.  3. How WWVB Radio Controlled Clocks Work The sole purpose of NIST radio station WWVB is to distribute time and frequency information from the national standard to the American public. The station continuously broadcasts a time code on a carrier frequency of 60 kHz at an effective radiated output power of 50 kW, which is strong enough to reach all 50 states. 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 9   A simplified block diagram of WWVB is shown in Figure 11. The 60 kHz carrier frequency is locked to the output of a cesium oscillator whose frequency is steered to agree with the national standard. A time code generator synchronized to UTC modulates the signal once per second by dropping the carrier power 10 dB (90%). If full power is restored 200 ms later, it represents a 0 bit. If full power is restored 500 ms later, it represents a 1 bit (Figure 12). A position marker is sent by dropping the power for 800 ms. Once the signal leaves the time code generators, it is sent to the transmitter, which amplifies the signal and broadcasts it using a large antenna array.  Figure 11. Simplified Block Diagram of NIST Radio Station WWVB.  Although this is a form of amplitude modulation, it is generally referred to as pulse width modulation by reduced carrier transmission. This is because the information contained in the signal is demodulated by looking at the pulse widths, and not by looking at the amplitude. The other LF time stations (Table 1) use variations of this technique to modulate the time code.  Figure 12. Pulse Width Modulation by Reduced Carrier Transmission.  In today's world of high speed communications, it's interesting to note that the WWVB code is sent at a very slow rate of 1 bit per second (imagine sending an email or fax at that speed), and it takes a full minute to send a complete time code. However, since the information is sent so slowly, it has the advantage of requiring very little bandwidth to transmit, and RCCs require very little processing power to decode the signal. Technically, the bandwidth requirement is just 5 Hz, but due to the nature of the transmission system the station has a bandwidth allocation of 2 kHz, of which several hundred hertz are currently used.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  10   The time Since the when the transmits  code contains time-of-day, date, and daylight time code takes a full minute to send, an RCC clock is turned on, so it usually takes more than UTC, the RCC applies a time zone correction  saving time information (Figure 13). will probably miss the first time code one minute to set itself. Since WWVB to obtain local time. This time zone correction is set by the user, and needs to be changed if the RCC is moved to a different time zone.  Once an RCC has synchronized, it won't decode the signal from WWVB again for a while. Some clocks synchronize just once every 24 hours, usually at night, since the signal is stronger and easier to receive once the sun goes down. Between synchs, the Figure 13. WWVB Time Code Format. RCC keeps time using an internal quartz oscillator. Typically, the oscillator frequency is within a few parts per million of the correct frequency, which means it can keep time to within 1 second for a few days or more. Therefore, synching once per day makes the clock appear to be on the right second, even though it has likely gained or lost a fraction of a second since the last synchronization [10]. 3.1 The internals of a LF Radio Controlled Clock Due to large scale production and advanced manufacturing techniques, it should soon cost just a few cents to add RCC capability to an existing quartz clock. However, one of the biggest challenges has been building miniature antennas that work with such long wavelength signals. One type of antenna often used in WWVB wall clock and desk clock designs is a ferrite loop, similar to those found inside an AM radio. This antenna consists of a ferrite bar wrapped with a coil of fine wire. The  Figure 14. Antennas for various RCC frequencies.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  11   length of wire and the way it is positioned and wrapped on the bar determine how well the antenna works. Figure 14 shows a variety of RCC antennas, designed for several of the stations listed in Table 1. Digital signal processing circuits that use small amounts of space and power make it possible to manufacture receivers small enough to fit in an ordinary sized wristwatch. However, a radio controlled watch presents even a bigger challenge for the antenna designer, since the antenna must be inconspicuous and fit inside a very small space. Some wristwatches, particularly early Figure 15. Inside a WWVB watch. models such as the one shown in Figure 9, placed the antenna inside the wrist band, but this meant that the band could be replaced only with another band of the same type. More recent designers place miniature antennas, often less than 20 mm wide, inside the watch itself as shown in Figure 15. In spite of these design challenges, some wristwatches now can receive signals from all or most of the stations listed in Table 1. This allows international travelers to get the correct time in most parts of the world, simply by changing the time zone setting on their watch. The RCCs that receive multiple LF transmitters have the internal processing ability to read multiple time codes, but still have to make do with a single antenna. When a different transmitter is selected, some designs match the antenna circuit to the antenna by varying the capacitance values, and generating a frequency near the desired carrier (for example, 60 kHz in the case of MSF or WWVB) from the receiver's local oscillator. However, since the size constraints make it difficult to build a narrow band antenna optimized for LF signals, the objective is simply to get as much of the signal as possible, and to use the local clock frequency to help pull the desired signal out of the noise. Some of the latest products are able to automatically select a time station by finding the strongest available signal, a feature that should become more common and useful if more LF time stations are built. It is still up to the user, however, to select the time zone. 4. Other Types of Radio Controlled Clocks There are many types of clocks and time displays that are automatically synchronized via wireless signals, some of which you are probably not aware of, since the process is transparent. As this section describes, televisions, cell phones, and pagers are just a few of the devices that have built-in radio controlled clocks. There are no guarantees that these clocks will always be correct; however, most are referenced to either GPS or a NIST time and frequency broadcast. 4.1 Televisions Most current models of televisions and videocassette recorders (VCR) have the ability to synchronize their clocks with time codes sent by the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). The time code is contained in the vertical blanking interval (VBI), or the first 21 horizontal lines of the 525-line analog video field that are not part of the visible picture. Based in part on work 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 12   begun by NIST (then called the National Bureau of Standards, or NBS) during the 1970's [22], the television networks began using line 21 of the VBI to send text messages for closed captioning, a service for the hearing impaired (NBS received an Emmy award for this work in 1980). By 1993, all television sets with displays of 33 cm (13 inches) and larger sold in the United States were required to have closed captioning capability, or the ability to decode line 21. Field 2 of line 21 is also used for the Extended Data Service (XDS), which includes a time code (Figure 16) containing UTC, the date, daylight saving time information, and a time zone offset [23]. Digital television (DTV) systems can carry more information than analog systems. However, the time code information is still provided, either on line 21 as before, or on a separate data stream defined by the DTV captioning standard [24].  Figure 16. The XDS Line 21 Time Code for Television.  By mutual agreement within the broadcasting industry, the XDS time code is inserted by PBS stations only. TVs and VCRs use a feature (developed by PBS and the Sony Corporation), where each channel is scanned for a time code beginning with channel 2. Once a time code is found, the TV or VCR synchronizes its clock. Although this time code has been wrong in the past [25], PBS is currently working on a system to ensure that all of its stations broadcast a signal that is ""frame accurate"", or within 33.3 ms of UTC. Due to transmitting systems that can buffer several frames, the received uncertainty might still be as large as 100 ms. The time code is broadcast by over 160 PBS stations, and reaches well over 90% of the United States population. 4.2 GPS Clocks The GPS signals broadcast via satellite by the United States Air Force are used worldwide both as a positioning tool with uncertainties of a few meters, and as a timekeeping tool with uncertainties measured in nanoseconds. The satellites carry on-board atomic clocks controlled by 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 13   the USNO. Despite their potentially unmatched accuracy, GPS RCCs are not common in the consumer marketplace because GPS signals are difficult to receive with indoor antennas. This is due to the line-of-sight nature of the signal (the sky must be visible to the antenna), and to the extremely low power level of the spread spectrum signal. However, a few GPS RCCs do exist, such as the wristwatch pictured in Figure 17. GPS watches are bulkier (due to the antenna size), and more expensive than their LF counterparts, but they provide more information than just the time, including your location, and the speed at which you are traveling. Most consumer GPS products receive their time code on the L1 carrier at 1575.42 MHz. The information broadcast by GPS includes the number of weeks, the number of seconds, and the number of leap seconds since January 6, 1980, when the GPS time scale originated. Using this information, a GPS receiver can quickly compute UTC. Precise UTC is usually displayed by all GPS receivers, including the lowest cost handheld models. It is also possible (although not common in early products) for a GPS RCC with a geographical database to use the position information to identify the RCC's time zone, and to then automatically apply a time zone correction without asking the user to enter one. An interesting new development in GPS technology is the addition of the L5 carrier at 1176.45 MHz, and the promise of a higher power L1 carrier on future satellites. Although it could be 2015 or later before the satellites have these new capabilities, they could make ""indoor GPS"" a reality, and eventually make GPS RCCs commonplace.  Figure 17. GPS wristwatch.  4.3 Cell Phones The time displayed on your cellular telephone should be correct, at least when the phone is first turned on and has just synchronized to the signal. Cellular signals originate from Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) base stations that operate in compliance with Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA/EIA) Standard IS-95 [26]. All base stations contain GPS receivers, and by definition, IS-95 time is GPS time. The base stations act as GPS repeaters by retransmitting the GPS time they receive from the satellites. There are two types of IS-95 CDMA systems, distinguished by their frequency bands. The original analog cellular system, called the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), transmits base station signals (forward link signals) using frequencies from 869 to 894 MHz. The newer and more common Personal Communications Systems (PCS) band sends forward link signals in the 1930 to 1990 MHz range. Since the time and frequency information on either band is receiveonly (no reverse link signals are sent), it is not necessary to subscribe to a telephone service to receive time signals. Therefore, a few radio controlled cellular clock products have appeared on 2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium 14   the market. These clocks should work anywhere a cell phone would work, and actually in some places where a cell phone will not work, since the forward link signal from the base station usually travels farther than the reverse link signal from a cell phone [27]. 4.4 Car Radios FM receivers can obtain time-of-day information from the Radio Data System (RDS) broadcast by many FM radio stations on a 57 kHz subcarrier. RDS is used to identify stations and radio programs, and automatically synchronizes the clocks on some car radios, clock radios, and communication receivers that already receive FM broadcasts. An estimated 15% of the approximately 5000 FM radio stations in the United States now utilize RDS. Every minute, the RDS sends a time code (Figure 18) containing the Modified Julian Date (MJD), the UTC hour and minute, and the local time zone offset [28]. RDS is also used for auto clock synchronization on some clock radios and communication receivers.  Figure 18. The RDS Time Code for FM Radio.  4.5 Pagers Like cell phones, the time displayed on pagers is indirectly synchronized to GPS. Several wristwatches now sold in the United States automatically synchronize using the FLEX paging protocol developed by Motorola, and other paging protocols have also been used for clock synchronization. The FLEX time code is modulated on to a forward link frequency near 931 MHz. As with the cellular phone systems described earlier, it is not necessary to subscribe to a paging service to use the time code. 4.6 SPOT Technology Wristwatches Wristwatches that utilize the Smart Personal Objects Technology (SPOT) developed by Microsoft and SCA Data Systems are expected to appear in late 2003. These devices will receive information such as stock prices, weather data, and sports scores. They also will receive a time code that will synchronize the watch, including a correction for the local time zone. The SPOT technology is similar to the Radio Data System described earlier; information is sent from existing FM radio stations on a 67 kHz subcarrier leased by Microsoft. The watches are initially expected to work in 100 large metropolitan areas covering all 50 states, plus in 13 metropolitan areas in Canada.  2003 NCSL International Workshop and Symposium  15   5. Summary In today's world, most of us already either knowingly or unknowingly obtain the time from radio controlled clocks. Due to recent advances in technology, we appear to be moving quickly towards the day when nearly every clock display will be synchronized with an uncertainty of less than 1 second, and when the ""exact time"" is available to everyone.

Tom Ridge, Secretary of Environmental    Protection James M. Seif today announced that the current episode of the award-winning    television series ""GreenWorks for Pennsylvania"" features an overview of the    recommendations made by the Governor’s 21 st  Century Environment Commission.   The series is produced by the Environmental Fund for Pennsylvania (EFP) and    the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Viewers should check their    local television listings for telecast times in their area. Viewers also can    see these programs online through the GreenWorks website.   Following a video-magazine format, this episode, ""Pennsylvania’s Environment    in the 21 st  Century,"" gives viewers practical examples of how    Pennsylvanians already are implementing commission ideas.    Highlights of this month’s episode include:    An interview with a Bucks County realtor who worked with his local township    to take a new approach to building homes that preserve open space;    A visit to the Park Forest Elementary School in State College, Centre County,    for examples of the kinds of environmental education programs needed to teach    the next generation to respect nature and how their actions can make a difference;     The amazing transformation of Washington’s Landing in Pittsburgh and a look    into how a developer helped turn an island filled with abandoned buildings into    a desirable place to live and work;    A project to plant more than 2,000 trees in neighborhoods throughout the City    of Harrisburg, and the economic and environmental benefits of city beautification;    and   A profile of Catherine Minnis of the West Philadelphia Habitat for Humanity    organization. This volunteer of the month, along with other residents of her    neighborhood, founded this chapter of Habitat for Humanity in 1987 to restore    abandoned homes and to clean up her community.   Last week, Gov. Ridge acted on a key recommendation made by his 21 st     Century Environment Commission by signing an Executive Order to identify and    promote the use of best land-management practices across the Commonwealth.   Gov. Ridge said the Executive Order represents the first step in what will    be a concerted effort in his second term to achieve a consensus in Pennsylvania    on land use and other critical environmental issues identified by the commission    for the 21 st  century.   ""The GreenWorks ‘Pennsylvania’s Environment in the 21 st  Century'    show is a chance to see all the creative ways Pennsylvanians are finding to    re-energize their communities by preserving open space and farmland,"" said EFP    executive director Timothy J. Schlitzer. ""The goal of the 'GreenWorks for Pennsylvania'    television program is to present positive examples of how Pennsylvanians are    taking care of our environment.""   EFP produces a half-hour show for television outlets across the state each    month. Previous programs have addressed clean-air issues; Pennsylvania's watersheds;    land use; pollution prevention; Pennsylvania environmental education initiatives;    ways to make the home environmentally friendly; Pennsylvania's nationally acclaimed    community recycling program; energy efficiency; DEP's new Southcentral regional    ""green"" office building; and winners of the Governor’s Awards for Environmental    Excellence.

Accident reports and studies reveal that owners and FCC licensees need to be more aware of the need for conformance to obstruction marking and lighting specifications.  When radio towers are greater than 200 feet in height and/or near an airport, the owner or licensee must apply for FCC issued obstruction marking and lighting specifications. During construction, temporary warning lights must be installed at the top of the structure, and at each level where permanent lights will be installed. Licensees should insure that their towers are marked and lighted in accordance with the specifications on their permits. Daily inspections must be made to ensure that the lights are on and operating properly. Any variances must be approved by the FCC's Antenna Survey Branch (ASB). If a light outage occurs which cannot be corrected within thirty minutes, the local FAA Flight Service Station (FSS) must be contacted immediately. The FSS will issue a warning to pilots. The FSS must also be notified when the lights are again operational so the warning may be rescinded. The FCC intends to continue its close scrutiny of radio towers. Appropriate action, including issuance of fines and/or revocation of the station license, will be taken against the user or owner of any unauthorized or improperly marked radio tower. ******   RELEASED: MARCH 3, 1999 By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau: In re: Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) (Single and Multichannel)  APPLICATION FOR ASSIGNMENT OF AUTHORIZATION ACCEPTED FOR FILING: Upon initial review, the following assignment application has been accepted for filing.

Nazario:  This letter is in reply to your letter, received September 2, 1997, requesting Special Temporary Authorization (""STA"") for a new low power radio broadcast station on Channel 224 (92.7 MHz) in Orlando, Florida.    In the STA request, you cite  47 U.S.C. §§303(g) and 157(a) for the proposition that the Commission is required to ""study new uses for radio and provide for experimental uses of frequencies"" as well as ""encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.""  You also note that, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §324, all radio stations must use the minimum amount of power necessary to carry out the communication desired,  except  for radio communication and signals relating to vessels in distress.  You state that your STA proposal provides the opportunity for the Commission to fulfill these statutory policies, as well as furthering the Commission's goal of diversification in the control of broadcast outlets.  Consequently, you request an STA under 47 U.S.C. §15.7(a) to operate on the frequency of 92.7 MHz with a power of less than 100 watts and an antenna height of less than 120 feet.  You indicate that you have operated with the facilities for which STA is sought here for over eight months and that no complaints have yet been received.  Finally, you state that your station serves the needs and interests of the Hispanic community in Orlando, which are not being met currently by existing commercial AM and FM stations; you therfore state that your STA request is unique.   Discussion.   Because your request for STA lacks the necessary Anti-Drug Abuse certification, it cannot be processed and will be dismissed below.   See Report and Order  in GEN Docket No. 90-312, 6 FCC Rcd 7551, 7556 n. 25 (1991).  However, for your information, we will address the substance of your STA request.   Initially, we note that the Commission receives similar inquiries from persons wanting to operate a low power radio station nearly every day.  Many of those who call or write cite the same reasons expressed in your STA request -- no interference, no complaints, proper maintenance, and community service.   Consequently, your request is far from unique.   A station operating with the level of power you have specified would be classified as a Class D broadcast station.  Because the Commission no longer allows the licensing of new Class D FM stations under Part 73 of the Commission's Rules, the STA request seeks authorization pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §15.7(a).  That rule provides for special temporary authorization in exceptional situations where (1) the operation does not conform to Part 15 of the Commission's Rules; (2) the operation would be a unique type of station that cannot be established as a regular service, and (3) the proposed operation would serve the public interest.  We find that your STA request cannot be granted because it fails to demonstrate the existence of an ""exceptional situation"" meeting the requirements of Section 15.7(a).  We note in particular that, although the subject STA request asserts that the proposed operation would be in the public interest, it does not include any showing to support this assertion.  To the contrary, in 1978 the Commission examined the issue of low power 10 watt or Class D stations.  In that rule making proceeding, which included an opportunity for public comment, the Commission found that low power stations were becoming a hindrance to the orderly development of the noncommercial educational FM band.  The need to protect the small service areas of Class D stations precluded the establishment of larger stations which could serve a greater population and area with greater efficiency.  Therefore, the Commission decided that it would not authorize new FM stations with effective radiated powers of less than 100 watts (the minimum power required for a Class A station).    Changes in the Rules Relating to Noncommercial Educational FM Broadcast Stations (Second Report and Order) , 69 FCC 2d 240 (1978),  reconsideration denied,  70 FCC 2d 972 (1979).   See also  47 C.F.R. § 73.512(c).  The Commission reexamined the question of low power radio stations in 1990 in the context of a notice and comment rule making proceeding in MM Docket 88-140.  In that rule making proceeding, the Commission considered public comments suggesting that low power FM translator stations should be permitted to originate their own programming.  (A translator station is essentially a low power repeater station which rebroadcasts the service of a full service station on a different frequency.)  In that proceeding, most commenters agreed that the Commission should continue to prohibit the broadcasting of original programming from translator stations, because allowing original programming would likely lead to a vast increase in the number of translator stations and degraded service for all FM stations due to increased interference.  Amendment of Part 74 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Translator Stations , 7 FCC Rcd 7212 (1990);  reconsideration denied in pertinent part , 8 FCC Rcd 5093 (1993).    In light of these two rule making proceedings, any public interest showing regarding a proposed station operating with the facilities specified in the STA request would, therefore, have to meet a very high threshold to warrant grant.  You have not met that burden here.  In this vein, we also find that your citations to various sections of the Communications Act are unpersuasive.  For example, 47 U.S.C. §324 is inapplicable, because your STA request does not fall into the ""minimum power"" exception carved out for maritime distress signals.  With respect to Sections 303(g) and 157(a) of the Act, the above discussion illustrates that the Commission has indeed examined the propriety of ""low power"" FM broadcast stations such as that proposed here, and determined that their authorization would not further the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  Moreover, the Communications Act expressly limits the grant of STA's for a period of not more than 180 days.  Thus, an STA request is not valid as a request for permanent authorization.  As set forth above, are there no ""extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest,"" nor have you demonstrated that ""delay in the institution of such temporary operation would seriously prejudice the public interest.""  See 47 U.S.C. § 309(f).   Orlando is currently well served by twelve radio broadcast stations. Consequently, if you wish to obtain authorization for a radio broadcast station, as noted by Mass Media Bureau Chief Roy J. Stewart in his correspondence to you dated March 31, 1997, you must file a completed construction permit application on FCC Form 340  (completing all the technical and legal information) and receive grant of the construction permit before any construction or broadcast operations may commence.  Consequently, your request for Special Temporary Authorization IS DISMISSED.    WFMA Radio Maranatha has no authority to operate an FM radio station in the manner proposed in the request for an STA or in the application for a construction permit.  Additionally, any operation that occurred during the pendency of the subject request and application was unauthorized.  A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Commission's Compliance and Information Bureau for whatever action it deems necessary in this matter.  This is a staff action not subject to judicial review.  If you wish to appeal this action, you may file an application for review by the full Commission under 47 C.F.R. §1.115.  If the Commission upholds this action , you may file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit under 47 U.S.C. §402(b)(1).  Additionally, as noted in Footnote 1 above, three separate parties have recently filed petitions for rule making ragarding low power broadcast stations.  While the comment period in these proceedings has closed, you may wish to submit your own petition for rule making on this matter.  See 47 C.F.R. §1.401.

You request authority to operate with the following facilities:  Frequency:                           102.1 MHz Location:                                      Brookline, MA 02146 Effective Radiate Power:             110 watts daytime Antenna height AMSL:                 Less than 100 feet Call letters:                               WXBC Construction Permit No:              97JDCB  You indicate that you submitted a payment for Special Temporary Authorization and the call sign ""years ago between 9/88 and 8/97.""  You further state that the station would be located 3.7 miles from an international airport, and that the free form format of the station would consist of classic rock & comedy. (Footnote 1)   Each request for STA or STA extension must contain an appropriate filing fee (currently $125.00, accompanied by FCC Form 159 with Fee Payment Code ""MGT"").   See  47 C.F.R. §§1.1101, 1.1104. Additionally, each request for STA or STA extension must contain an Anti-Drug Abuse certification.   See Report and Order  in GEN Docket No. 90-312, 6 FCC Rcd 7551, 7556 n. 25 (1991).  Because your July 22, 1997 request lacks both of these requirements, it cannot be processed and will be dismissed below.  However, for your information, we will address the substance of the STA request.   A station operating with the level of power you have specified would be classified as a Class D broadcast station.  Because the Commission no longer allows the licensing of new Class D FM stations under Part 73 of the Commission's Rules, the STA request seeks authorization pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §15.7(a).  That rule provides for special temporary authorization in exceptional situations where (1) the operation does not conform to Part 15 of the Commission's Rules; (2) the operation would be a unique type of station that cannot be established as a regular service, and (3) the proposed operation would serve the public interest.  We find that your STA request cannot be granted because it fails to demonstrate the existence of an ""exceptional situation"" meeting the requirements of Section 15.7(a).  We note in particular that, although the subject STA request asserts that the proposed operation would be in the public interest, it does not include any showing to support this assertion.  To the contrary, in 1978 the Commission examined the issue of low power 10 watt or Class D stations.  In that rule making proceeding, which included an opportunity for public comment, the Commission found that low power stations were becoming a hindrance to the orderly development of the noncommercial educational FM band.  The need to protect the small service areas of Class D stations precluded the establishment of larger stations which could serve a greater population and area with greater efficiency.  Therefore, the Commission decided that it would not authorize new FM stations with effective radiated powers of less than 100 watts (the minimum power required for a Class A station).    Changes in the Rules Relating to Noncommercial Educational FM Broadcast Stations (Second Report and Order) , 69 FCC 2d 240 (1978),  reconsideration denied , 70 FCC 2d 972 (1979).   See also  47 C.F.R. § 73.512(c).  The Commission reexamined the question of low power radio stations in 1990 in the context of a notice and comment rule making proceeding in MM Docket No. 88-140.  In that rule making proceeding, the Commission considered public comments suggesting that low power FM translator stations should be permitted to originate their own programming.  (A translator station is essentially a low power repeater station which rebroadcasts the service of a full service station on a different frequency.)  In that proceeding, most commenters agreed that the Commission should continue to prohibit the broadcasting of original programming from translator stations, because allowing original programming would likely lead to a vast increase in the number of translator stations and degraded FM service due to increased interference.    Amendment of Part 74 of the Commissions Rules Concerning Translator Stations , 7 FCC Rcd 7212 (1990);  reconsideration denied in pertinent part , 8 FCC Rcd 5093 (1993).   In light of these two rule making proceedings, any public interest showing regarding a proposed station operating with the facilities specified in the STA request would, therefore, have to meet a very high threshold to warrant grant.  You have not met that burden here.  Moreover, the Communications Act expressly limits the grant of STA's for a period of not more than 180 days.  Thus, an STA request is not valid as a request for permanent authorization.  As set forth above, there are no ""extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest"" nor have you shown that ""delay in the institution of such temporary operation would seriously prejudice the public interest.""   See  47 U.S.C. § 309(f).   Consequently, if you wish to obtain authorization for a radio broadcast station, you must file a completed construction permit application on FCC Form 340 (completing all the technical and legal information), requesting an appropriate waiver as necessary, and receive grant of the construction permit before any construction or broadcast operations may commence.  Consequently, your request for Special Temporary Authorization for a low power FM radio broadcast station IS DISMISSED.  I have enclosed two Information Sheets, ""How to Apply for a Broadcast Station"" and ""Low Power AM and FM Broadcast Radio Stations"", for your information, along with a construction permit application on FCC Form 340.  In addition, we note that three separate parties have filed petitions for rule making pending with the Commission regarding low power broadcast stations.   See Public Notice, Rule Making No. 9246  (March 18, 1998);  Public Notice, Rule Making No. 9242  (February 20, 1998);  Public Notice, Rule Making No. 9208  (February 5, 1998).

In January, we adopted a Report and Order establishing a low power FM radio service.1 We authorized this new service to provide opportunities for new voices to be heard, while at the same time preserving the integrity and technical excellence of existing FM radio service and safeguarding its transition to a digital transmission mode. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, we dispose of petitions for reconsideration2 of the Report and Order, make certain changes to our rules, and provide certain clarifications of our rules.3 2. In the Report and Order, the Commission authorized two new classes of FM radio service, known collectively as low power FM (LPFM). The LP100 class will consist of stations with a maximum power of 100 watts effective radiated power (ERP) at 30 meters antenna height above average terrain (HAAT), providing a signal level equivalent to the FM ""protected"" service (1 mV/m or 60 dBu) within a radius of approximately 3.5 miles. After a period of time sufficient to act on LP100 applications that are  1 2 3  Report and Order, MM Docket No. 99-25, 15 FCC Rcd 2205 (2000). Hereinafter the Memorandum Opinion and Order. The list of petitioners is attached at Appendix E.  Both Amherst Alliance and Don Schellhardt filed Motions for a Decision on their respective reconsideration petitions, urging the Commission to act on their reconsideration petitions before issuing licenses. We dismiss these motions as moot. To the extent the motions raise new arguments, we dismiss them as untimely filed Petitions for Reconsideration.  2   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  filed, the Mass Media Bureau will accept applications for LP10 stations.4 These stations will have a maximum power of 10 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT, providing the same signal strength out to approximately 1 or 2 miles from the station's antenna. To avoid compromising existing FM radio service, given the new nature of the LPFM service, we imposed separation requirements for LPFM with respect to full power stations operating on co-, 1st - and 2nd - adjacent and intermediate frequency (IF) channels. Based on our engineers' technical analysis and careful review of other analyses submitted, we determined that 100-watt LPFM stations operating without 3rd adjacent channel separation requirements will not result in unacceptable new interference to the service of existing FM stations.5 We decided, therefore, not to impose 3rd adjacent channel separation requirements because doing so would unnecessarily and substantially restrict the number of LPFM stations that could be authorized, particularly in higher population areas. 3. We restricted LPFM service to noncommercial operations by noncommercial educational entities and public safety radio services. With certain narrow exceptions, we decided to restrict ownership to entities that have no attributable interest in any other broadcast station or other media subject to our ownership rules. We severely restricted the number of LPFM stations that a single entity can own and limited ownership to locally-based entities for the first two years. We determined not to permit the sale of an LPFM station. To resolve mutually exclusive applications, we decided to use a point system that favors local ownership and locally-originated programming, with time-sharing and successive license terms as tie-breakers. Finally, we have minimized the regulatory burdens imposed on these stations, consistent with their size and very localized operation. For example we decided not to impose specific requirements regarding main studio staffing or location, maintenance of public files, and the filing of ownership reports. 4. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, we generally affirm the decisions we reached in the Report and Order, although we make some changes and clarify certain aspects of our rules. As explained below, we reject arguments by petitioners proposing more stringent channel separation requirements, as well as arguments in favor of relaxing those requirements. We adopt complaint and license modification procedures to ensure that if any unexpected, significant 3rd adjacent channel interference problems are caused by the operation of a particular LPFM station, it can be resolved expeditiously. We decline to modify the permissible power levels for the service. We modify the spacing standards adopted in the Report and Order to require that LPFM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels protect stations operating radio reading services and, pending further study, will not authorize an LPFM station that would not be sufficiently geographically separated from any full-service FM station on a 3rd adjacent channel that operates a radio reading service as of the date of the adoption of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. We also decline to alter the noncommercial nature of the service. We affirm our decision to apply our character qualifications policy with respect to former illegal broadcasters. We increase the flexibility of the ownership rules for certain specific types of applicants: government, transportation and public safety entities, and universities. We provide clarifications on 4  We are accepting applications for LP100 stations on a geographically staggered basis. See Appendix C for the filing window schedule. The initial filing window for the first region closed June 8, 2000. The initial filing window for the fifth, and last, region is expected to be opened in May 2001. 5  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2206,  2.  3   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  eligibility issues concerning Indian tribes, student stations, licensees in the Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), and schools with multiple campuses. We affirm our tie-breaker criteria, with certain clarifications regarding the credit for programming that is locally originated. Finally, we address a number of questions and suggestions regarding individual elements of our rules. II. ISSUE ANALYSIS A. Technical Rules 1. Second and Third Adjacent Channel Protection  5. In the Report and Order, we determined that it was not necessary to require that LPFM stations protect other full or low power FM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels, i.e., stations +/600 KHz apart.6 Our decision on this issue was based on our finding that 100-watt LPFM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels will not result in significant new interference to the service of existing FM stations. We concluded that any small amount of interference that may occur in individual cases would be outweighed by the benefits of new low power FM service. We also determined that the risk of interference from LPFM stations on 2nd adjacent channels may be somewhat higher than that from such operations on 3rd adjacent channels and therefore chose to retain 2nd adjacent channel protection requirements for LPFM stations. 6. These decisions were based on the substantial record of information and analyses on FM receiver performance characteristics that was developed in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding.7 The record included three technical studies of FM receivers that were filed by commenting parties: 1) FM Interference Tests, Laboratory Test Report, Thomas B. Keller, Robert B. McCutheon, Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), 1999, conducted under the auspices of National Public Radio (NPR), CEMA and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) (CEMA study); 2) Technical Studies and Reports filed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB study); and 3) Receiver Evaluation Project conducted by Broadcast Signal Lab, LLP for the National Lawyers' Guild, Committee on Democratic Communications (NLG study).8 The Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology also conducted a study of FM receivers that was placed in the record of the proceeding (OET study).9 In addition, NAB and CEMA filed supplementary For example, the 3 adjacent channels to an FM station operating on 97.1 MHz are at 97.7 MHz and 96.5 MHz. 7 6 rd  The NPRM was adopted on January 28, 1999 in response to petitions for rulemaking and related comments indicating substantial interest in, and public support for, increased citizen access to the airwaves. After issuance of the NPRM, we received comments and letters from thousands of groups and individuals seeking license for new radio stations. These comments  from churches or other religious organizations, students, labor unions, community organizations and activists, musicians, and other citizens  reflect a broad interest in service from highly local radio stations strongly grounded in their communities. 8 9  The NLG study was funded by NLG, UCC and several others.  See Second and Third Adjacent Interference Study of FM Broadcast Receivers, OET Report FCC/OET TRB-99-1, prepared by William H. Inglis and David L. Means, July 1999.  4   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  technical information in their reply comments and a Technical Analysis of the Low Power FM Service by Theodore S. Rappaport (August 26, 1999) was submitted by the Media Access Project as part of its replies (Rappaport study). 7. 3rd Adjacent Channel Protection. In its petition, National Public Radio, Inc. (NPR) requests that we reconsider our decision not to apply 3rd adjacent channel protection requirements to LPFM stations. NPR disagrees with our findings that any risk of interference from 100-watt LPFM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels is small and that any such interference that does occur is, on balance, outweighed by the benefits of the new service. It argues that neither of these premises, nor our decision to reduce the existing FM interference protections, are supported by the record. To remedy its concerns, NPR requests that we revise our rules to provide additional measures to avoid and ameliorate the potential for interference by LPFM stations to the services of existing FM full service, translator and booster stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels. It states that imposition of 3rd adjacent channel protections for LPFM stations is particularly justified to protect public radio stations. It also states that, at a minimum, we should amend the rules to provide a process that permits the challenge and denial of an LPFM application on a 3rd adjacent channel that would be likely to cause harmful interference within the service area of any existing or proposed full service, translator or booster station. 8. In arguing for this request, NPR contends that we justified our decision on 3rd adjacent channel protection by disregarding those laboratory tests that demonstrated a likelihood of interference, and relying instead on our own analysis. It asserts that in so doing, the Report and Order fails to address ""the numerous fundamental flaws in the Commission's testing and analysis.""10 It also argues that our finding that any interference that may occur would be outweighed by the benefits of new low power FM service is flawed. As discussed below, we cannot concur in NPR's arguments, and are denying its request that we amend the rules to provide protection for existing FM services against potential interference from 3rd adjacent channel LPFM operations.11 9. NPR asserts that we disregarded laboratory tests that demonstrated a likelihood of interference from 3rd adjacent channel LPFM operations. This is incorrect. We did, in fact, fully consider all of the receiver test data and evaluations presented in the record of this proceeding. We simply found that the test data supported different conclusions than those reached by NPR and other parties seeking to maintain 3rd adjacent channel protections for LPFM service -- specifically that licensing 100-watt and 10watt LPFM channels on 3rd adjacent channels will not result in significant new interference to the service of existing FM stations. This is plainly evident from the Report and Order, which first summarizes the major FM receiver technical studies, and then explains our evaluation of the potential for interference from low power FM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels based on this information. For example, we examined the potential for interference in the immediate vicinity of a 100-watt LPFM station using the NAB's median receiver performance test results for its three ""worst"" performing FM receiver categories, i.e., clock, personal and portable, and found that the area where such receivers could potentially experience degradation from interference is small, generally one kilometer or less from an  10 11  NPR Petition at 4. rd  We do, however, as discussed in detail below, 57-67, adopt a 3 adjacent channel complaint and license rd modification procedure that will better protect stations from unacceptable 3 adjacent channel interference.  5   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  LPFM antenna site.  12  10. NPR next contends that there are three fundamental flaws in the testing and analysis underlying our decision on the 3rd adjacent channel protection issue. It first argues that we established no benchmark against which to determine what, if any, new interference might be acceptable. NPR contends that it is not enough to simply critique the internationally accepted benchmark, i.e., ITU-R Recommendation 641, proposed by others, i.e., NAB and CEMA, as we did in the Report and Order. It submits that without a point of reference of acceptability, it is meaningless to say that any new interference is acceptable. Consistent with our longstanding policy of allowing market forces to determine the performance capabilities of FM receivers, we chose not to use a benchmark standard for evaluating the acceptability of new FM interference. We believe it is better to refrain from specifying standards for interference rejection capabilities, and as stated by UCC in its reply comments, instead allow the market to identify the level of interference rejection performance consumers find to be acceptable for different types of FM radios. 11. The data from the several receiver studies indicate that there is, in fact, considerable variation in the immunity of FM radios to interference across different categories of receivers, and to some extent, across models of receivers in the same class. These differences reflect manufacturers' response to the demand for receivers that meet varying needs, such as for automobile installations, high fidelity listening, and non-critical listening, a wide range of price points, and other design considerations. As indicated in the Report and Order, we believe that consumers understand that there are performance differences among the classes of radios and that they accept the fact that lower cost radios may provide more limited service capabilities. It also appears that market forces are providing FM receivers with levels of interference immunity that adequately meet consumers needs. We therefore believe that a benchmark immunity standard is unnecessary and could, in fact, be detrimental to consumer interests. Instead, we compared receiver performance to the same desired-to-undesired (D/U) protection ratios that we have traditionally used in managing interference between FM stations.13 We continue to believe that this is an appropriate approach for assessing the interference potential of low power FM stations. 12. In evaluating receiver performance, we did, however, find that the ITU-R Recommendation 641 50 dB S/N criterion used by NAB and the 45 dB S/N criterion used by CEMA were not appropriate criteria for today's FM radio service. In making this determination, we observed that the majority of the radios tested by NAB did not meet its 50 dB criterion with no interference present and with the strongest level of desired signal. Similarly, none of the radios tested by CEMA came close to meeting its target 45 12 13  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2245-46,  101-103.  The existing FM interference protections, which are provided through spacing standards, are based on the st nd following ratios: 20 dB co-channel D/U; 6 dB 1 adjacent channel D/U; -40 dB 2 adjacent channel D/U for rd commercial FM stations and 20dB for noncommercial stations operating in the reserved FM band; -40 dB 3 adjacent channel D/U. Receivers with the ability to reject interference at these ratios could be expected to provide interference free service within a station's 60 dBu contour service area. (Such radios might not, however, be able to receive service at all locations within that contour if they did not have sufficient sensitivity to receive signals at the 60 dBu level even in the absence of any interference.) Receivers with lower capabilities might experience interference within a station's service area, while those with higher capabilities might be able to reject interference at greater distances.  6   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  dB S/N criterion at the 20 dB D/U standard for co-channel interference used in the rules. We further noted that while the 20 dB co-channel D/U standard yields a monophonic S/N level of about 50 dB according to an earlier study by NAB, for the stereophonic operation used by FM stations today, the 20 dB protection ratio yields an audio S/N of only about 30 dB.14 13. NPR next argues that we failed to include any ""Category I"" radios, i.e., clock radios, shower radios, and other small, inexpensive radios with internal antennas, in our testing, and thereby did not consider the likelihood of interference to what are among the most inexpensive and commonly used radio receivers. Contrary to NPR's assertions and as UCC observes in its reply comments, we did consider data submitted on Category I radios by commenters in this proceeding. While our own initial study did not test inexpensive receivers with integral antennas because of the difficulty of providing test signals at accurately controlled levels to this type of device, we did rely on test data for these radios submitted by NAB, NPR/CEMA and NLG.15 As indicated above and in the Report and Order, we considered the results from all of the receivers tested in the studies in this proceeding, including the ""Category I"" radios tested by others, in our decision on 3rd adjacent channel interference. For example, in the Report and Order, we calculated the radii of LPFM potential interference based on test data submitted by NAB for Category I radios. The results of those tests show that the area in which these receivers would experience any degradation in performance from interference from a 3rd adjacent channel LPFM station would be small, generally 1 km or less from the LPFM antenna site.16 14. Third, NPR argues that our examination of receiver issues was an interim study. It contends that while we recognized that our study was limited in both the size of the sample of receivers tested and in the range of tests performed, we conducted no further laboratory tests and no field tests of potential interference issues prior to the Report and Order.17 As explained in the OET Study, that phase of the FCC Laboratory's examination of FM receivers was limited to the issues of 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel interference performance of analog FM receivers with respect to analog FM interferers and was limited in size to a fairly small sample of 21 receivers. Additional research was anticipated to expand the study sample as well as to broaden the scope to include digital interference issues. Neither of these planned extensions of the OET study was essential to our decision on application of 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel interference protections for LPFM service. Additional data on receiver performance was, in fact, provided through the NAB, CEMA, and NLG studies. By using the data from the three additional 14  See National Association of Broadcasters, ""Subjective Evaluation of Audio Degraded by Noise and Undesired FM Signals,"" Laurence C. Middlekamp, November 17, 1982. 15  See OET Study at 3. In addition, we did perform additional measurements on two ""Walkman"" type and two other radios (a clock radio and a portable ""boom-box"" unit) with integral antennas at our Laboratory. These tests were performed using a GTEM cell that does not require the radio under test to be modified. One of the radios tested was supplied by CEMA and was included in its testing. Our test of this radio produced results similar to those found by CEMA, confirming the NPR/CEMA results for that radio. However, our tests did find that this radio performed somewhat better than reported with the DX/LO switch in the opposite position from that tested by CEMA. 16 17  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2245-46, 101-102.  NPR indicates that to help clarify the interference issues, it is conducting field tests that it expected to complete by July. To date, we have not received the results of NPR's field testing.  7   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  studies, we were able to evaluate information on a total of 75 different radio receivers. We believed that this additional data provided a sufficient basis, in the aggregate, for evaluating interference issues, even if each of the studies individually may have tested a relatively small sample of receivers. Thus, we found no need to expand the size of the receiver sample. We therefore do not find that the limits of the OET study impaired our ability to decide the 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel protection issues in this proceeding.18 15. We also do not find it necessary to include field test information in our decision. The interference issues involved in this matter relate to receiver performance, qualities which are best examined through laboratory testing of a sample of receivers.19 There have been no questions raised in this proceeding that require new information on the propagation qualities of FM signals, and thus there was no reason to conduct field tests. Moreover, it would be difficult and costly to meaningfully conduct field tests for a sample of receivers, and we have no reason to believe that such tests would yield data on interference potential that would differ from that of the various laboratory studies. We therefore find no basis for delaying our decision on the 3rd adjacent channel protection issue to conduct field tests ourselves or to await the results of field tests conducted by others. 16. With regard to our finding that any interference that may occur would be outweighed by the benefits of new low power FM service, NPR argues that we did not actually balance costs and benefits. Rather, it argues that we simply asserted that LPFM will be beneficial and then strove to minimize the technical evidence of countervailing interference costs. NPR then argues that we failed to account for the significant harm that is likely to occur to existing radio services, and, in particular, to public radio services, whether in individual cases or the aggregate. 17. 18  We disagree with NPR that we did not balance the costs of any new interference expected  The Commission's concerns regarding interference to digital operations were also resolved based on the record in the proceeding. See  55-56. 19  We continue to believe that the principal issue is receiver performance, i.e. the ability of modern FM radios rd to reject unwanted 3 adjacent channel signals. Laboratory tests allow examination of individual receiver performance under controlled conditions. This permits precise control of both desired and interfering signals so that the interference performance of individual receivers can be accurately determined. Field testing, on the other hand, is generally used to confirm models or estimates of how both desired and interfering signals propagate to individual locations. For example, in the case of FM radio, estimates of desired field strength are based on the F(50, 50) field strength chart contained in Section 73.333 of the rules, 47 CFR  73.333, while estimates of interference are based on the F(50, 10) field strength chart in that Section. These charts shows the distances from their respective transmitters at which the desired signal strength is predicted to exceed a given level at 50 percent of the locations 50 percent of the time and at which the interfering signal strength is predicted to exceed a given level at 50 percent of the locations 10 percent of the time. In simple terms, this approach assumes that the desired signal is at an average level while the interfering signal is at a much stronger level, i.e., a ""worse case"" interference situation. These propagation and interference models have been used for many years for the FM radio and other services, and are independent of receiver performance. No questions have been raised by any of the parties in this proceeding regarding the propagation and interference models used for FM radio. Further, it is unclear as to what additional information, if any, field tests, would reveal about receiver performance, which is the principal technical issue in this rd matter affecting 3 adjacent channel interference. Field test data, in our opinion, would merely assess the accuracy of our propagation predictions, rather than reveal information on receiver performance.  8   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  from low power FM stations with the benefits these stations will provide. In the Report and Order, we indicated that low power radio stations will serve the public interest by providing opportunities for new voices to be heard, and in particular will enhance opportunities for locally focused community-oriented radio broadcasting.20 We observed that the comments in this proceeding -- from churches and other religious organizations, students, labor unions, community organizations and activists, musicians, and other citizens -- reflected a broad interest in the establishment of highly local radio stations strongly grounded in their communities, providing locally-based programming for listeners in those communities. We therefore believe that the low power FM service will provide substantial and important benefits to local radio audiences. We expect that LPFM stations will be technically able to serve significant local audiences, even in the presence of interfering signals from full-service FM stations. The 60 dBu service contour of a 100-watt LPFM station with an antenna height of 30 meters above average terrain (HAAT) extends 5.6 kilometers from the transmitting antenna site and encloses an area of 98.5 square kilometers. Without interference or other impairments to its signal, the non-directional LPFM facility could be expected to provide satisfactory signal coverage throughout this area. LPFM stations must be sufficiently geographically separated from full-service FM radio stations to prevent interference to any area within the FM station's protected service contour. For example, a separation of 67 kilometers is required to protect a Class A FM station at maximum permissible facilities; this distance includes the 20 kilometer interference buffer. LPFM stations, however, are not protected against receiving interference from existing or future FM stations.21 A separation of 92 kilometers from a Class A FM station (which does not include a buffer distance) is necessary to prevent interference within an LP100 station's 60 dBu contour. Thus, an LP100 station located at the minimum required separation to protect the Class A FM station would be predicted to receive some interference within its 5.6 kilometer service contour. On average, the interference-free distance from the LP100 antenna site would be reduced to approximately 4 kilometers from the transmitting antenna site and the corresponding interference-free service area would be reduced to about 50 square kilometers. Thus, even in this worst-case example, the LP100 station could be expected to provide interference-free service within half of the area within its 60 dBu contour, an area that might well be large enough to include the station's intended audience, such as residents of a college campus, local school district, or a neighborhood. 18. In deciding to authorize LPFM stations, we also affirmed our intention to preserve the integrity and technical excellence of the existing FM service and not to impede its transition to a digital future.22 To this end, we carefully considered the interference potential of LPFM operations to both existing FM stations and their future digital operations and adopted appropriate technical rules to minimize such interference. In the case of 3rd adjacent channel interference, we found that any interference that would occur from a low power station to an existing station's service would be limited to areas very close to the low power stations transmitter.23 In addition, the required minimum spacings between low power stations will greatly limit the maximum number of such stations that can operate 20 21  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2206-07,  2 - 3.  For informational purposes, Section 73.807 provides minimum distance separations necessary for an LPFM station to receive no interference from the various classes of FM stations. 47 C.F.R.  73.807. 22 23  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2206  2. Id. at 2245-46,  102  104.  9   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  within an existing station's service area on the 3rd adjacent channel. Thus, the level of new interference from LPFM stations will be very small. Accordingly, we have found, and continue to maintain, that the benefits of this new service outweigh the costs of any small amounts of interference that may occur. 19. We also disagree with NPR that interference from LPFM stations will be particularly harmful to public radio stations. NPR contends that we failed to account for the particular susceptibility of public radio stations to interference, especially in the case of reserved-spectrum stations. It submits that public radio stations are more likely to be affected by LPFM interference for a number of reasons. NPR first argues that stations in the reserved spectrum are more tightly ""packed"" together, and that our LPFM rules do not adequately address this congestion.24 However, NPR provides no specific information in support of its contention. Our conclusion that LPFM stations would not create unacceptable interference to existing full power stations is in no way undermined by the differing allocation methodologies used in the reserved and non-reserved bands. Since the minimum LPFM distance separation requirements are applied uniformly throughout the entire FM band, a full power station that operates in a crowded portion of the reserved band would be no more likely to receive interference from an LPFM station than would a station operating in the non-reserved band. Furthermore, the plan is conservative in that LPFM station separation requirements are based on the assumption that full-service stations operate with the maximum permissible facilities for their station class. In any event, as noted by UCC, our plan for authorizing low power FM service automatically mitigates any such differential effect on public stations by allowing fewer low power stations where existing stations are more closely spaced. In other words, fewer low power stations will fit into the reserved band in areas where noncommercial stations are more tightly packed. 20. NPR next argues that public radio stations are particularly vulnerable to interference because their signals typically use minimum ""loudness"" processing to preserve the natural dynamic range of the programming. It states that the heavy processing used with Top 40 stations limits the dynamic range to emphasize loudness and that this processing tends to mask the effect of interfering signals. We recognize that many public broadcasting stations minimize their use of loudness processing in order to provide quality service to their listeners. At the same time, we observe that it is generally necessary to use a higher quality receiver, such as a home stereo system, in order to actually experience the broader dynamic range audio provided by these stations. As indicated by the various receiver tests, home stereo receivers, car radios, and other high fidelity FM receivers generally are also able to adequately reject signals on 3rd adjacent channels at the levels to be transmitted by LPFM stations. We conclude that the audio experience of public radio station listeners generally will not be degraded by the operation of LPFM stations. 21. NPR further argues that we failed to address the potential harm of LPFM operations to statewide radio networks. Individual stations in a statewide network are typically sited to achieve  Stations on noncommercial reserved FM channels (channels 201-220, in the band 88-92 MHz) are authorized based on contour overlap, rather than the minimum spacing standards used for commercial stations. See section 73.509 of the rules, 47 C.F.R.  73.509. The contour overlap standards for noncommercial stations are the same as the D/U ratios on which the spacing standards for commercial stations are based, with one exception. The nd exception is that the D/U ratio for 2 adjacent channel protection for noncommercial stations is 20 dB, whereas the nd 2 adjacent channel spacing standard for commercial stations is based on the less stringent D/U ratio of 40 dB.  24  10   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  maximum signal coverage to the maximum population based on actual receipt of a quality signal, rather than a predicted contour overlap. NPR contends that LPFM stations are likely to pose a significant threat to such operations. As indicated above, our plan for the LPFM service will tend to limit the number of LPFM operations in locations where noncommercial stations are more closely spaced. In such locations, to the extent that a small amount of interference would occur, in many instances the programming provided by the noncommercial station would be available from another station in the network. We therefore do not believe that LPFM stations on 3rd adjacent channels will have harmful consequences for statewide radio networks. 22. Finally, NPR states that interference from television service on TV channel 6 and the need to avoid interference to such service reduces the amount of reserved FM-band spectrum that might otherwise be available. It contends that the new LPFM rules introduce new sources of interference in a portion of the FM spectrum that is already significantly compromised. We believe that channel 6 operations will limit the opportunities for low power stations in that area. In addition, we recently expanded the opportunities for allocating additional reserved channels in the non-reserved portion of the FM band in areas where there are TV channel 6 transmissions.25 We therefore find that allowing 3rd adjacent channel LPFM stations to operate in areas where noncommercial stations must be concerned with TV channel 6 signals will not have any significant effect on the amount of reserved FM-band spectrum that is otherwise available. 23. Radio Reading Services. In its petition, NPR requests that we provide additional interference protection for FM stations that operate radio reading services. Radio reading services, which provide access to printed news and other information sources for blind or print-disabled persons, are transmitted via FM station subcarrier (SCA) facilities. NPR asserts that the majority of these services are provided on public radio stations. Special radios that tune subcarrier signals are used to receive these services. NPR states that radio reading services are threatened by the new rules because subcarrier receivers are more vulnerable to interference than mass marketed receivers. It indicates that this is because subcarrier receivers are designed for wide-band reception, which makes them less selective in rejecting adjacent channel signals. It further states that because these receivers are designed to be modest in cost to meet the needs of the disabled constituency, their manufacture necessarily uses components that offer limited overload rejection and IF selectivity. It therefore asks that we revise the rules to apply the existing 3rd adjacent channel protection to those radio stations that offer radio reading services. 24. Like NPR, the Commission is concerned about the differential vulnerability of radio reading service receivers to 3rd adjacent channel interference. In this regard, we recognize the important and unique services that radio reading operations provide to blind and other print-disabled persons and the unique role of each radio reading service in its community. Accordingly, we are continuing to study how to best protect these services while preserving LPFM opportunities for as many applicants as is 25  See Report and Order in MM Docket No. 95-31 (Reexamination of the Competitive Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants), FCC 00-120 (released April 24, 2000), at  114-115. In that action, we indicated that, in addition to considering interference from TV Channel 6 (radio only) and foreign stations (radio only), we would also provide a needs test for future rule making requests that ask that non-reserved channels not already in the FM or TV Table of Allotments be added and reserved for noncommercial educational use. Under this test the noncommercial educational proponent would have to demonstrate that the need for a noncommercial educational station is greater than the need for a commercial station.  11   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  practical. For the immediate future we will require that LPFM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels protect the SCA operations of stations operating radio reading services. Until our studies are completed, we will not authorize an LPFM station that would not be sufficiently geographically separated from any full-service FM station on a 3rd adjacent channel that operated a radio reading service as of the date of adoption of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. 26 If the studies determine that these receivers are uniquely vulnerable to 3rd adjacent channel interference, prior to the second round of 100 watt filing windows we will protect stations that have added a radio reading service after the effective date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and LPFM applications filed thereafter will be required to provide 3rd adjacent channel protection to those stations. In this regard, we will apply the minimum distance separations used for interference protection from LPFM stations on the 2nd adjacent channel, which is based on a desired-to-undesired signal strength ratio of 40 dB. This protection ratio also underlies station separation requirements between full-service NCE stations on 3rd adjacent channels. We believe that this approach will adequately protect existing radio reading services while we confirm whether radio reading service receivers are uniquely vulnerable to 3rd adjacent channel interference. 25. 2nd Adjacent Channel Operation. J. Rodger Skinner and UCC request that we reconsider our decision to apply 2nd adjacent channel protection requirements to LPFM stations and revise the rules to allow operation of LPFM stations without regard to 2nd adjacent channel separation. They argue that maintaining 2nd adjacent channel protections for LPFM service will preclude the establishment of hundreds of new LPFM stations, mostly in major markets where they are needed. Skinner submits that our recent receiver tests, and the fact that no interference has been reported during the many years when short-spaced grandfathered full service stations were allowed to relocate without regard to 2nd or 3rd adjacent channel restrictions, are indicative that low power stations could operate on such channels without causing interference. UCC submits that, based on the findings of the Rappaport study, we could have relaxed 2nd adjacent channel protections for stations of 100 watts or less. 26. Skinner and UCC petitioners have not provided any new information on the 2nd adjacent channel issue that we did not have available and consider in deciding to retain 2nd adjacent channel protections for LPFM service. As we observed in the Report and Order, the receiver test data for 2nd adjacent channel interference rejection performance was generally on the order of 8-10 dB poorer than for 3rd adjacent channel performance. We therefore indicated that it appears that the risk of interference from 2nd adjacent channel LPFM operation may be somewhat higher. While the Rappaport study generally argues that elimination of 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel protections would result in a small potential for interference and therefore affect few FM listeners, the study's simulation results do indicate that in many situations there would be increased interference if 2nd adjacent channel protections were eliminated.27 In addition, applying 2nd adjacent channel protection requirements to LPFM stations will preserve flexibility for the development of in-band, on-channel (IBOC) digital audio systems for FM stations, as discussed in paragraphs 55-56. Accordingly, we are denying the petitioners' request that we eliminate 2nd adjacent channel protection requirements for LPFM stations.  26  A partial list of existing stations operating radio reading services is set forth in Appendix D. This information was provided by National Public Radio and the International Association of Audio Information Services. 27  See Appendix D to Rappaport study.  12   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  Regulatory Status of LPFM Stations 27. We decided in the Report and Order to require LPFM stations to protect existing fullpower FM stations, translator, boosters, and vacant allotments, according to the separation requirements adopted, and not to protect LPFM stations from interference introduced by new or modified FM stations. We also decided that LPFM stations will be required to cease operation if they cause interference within the 3.16 mV/m contour of a subsequently authorized or modified FM station. 28. The general manager of a student radio station at the University of Wisconsin (Black), urges us to reconsider this status for LPFM stations, arguing that it will discourage investment in LPFM stations, as their signals can be subsequently overpowered by full-power FM stations.28 We decline to reconsider our decision on this issue. One of our paramount goals in introducing LPFM service was that it not interfere with existing service.29 We continue to believe that the rules we adopted strike a reasonable balance between the need to foster new service and our responsibility both to maintain the integrity of existing FM service and to allow for its expansion to better serve the public. 29. For the same reasons, we will not adopt the proposal in the Amherst Petition that we use a ""modified primary"" status for LPFM or that we establish ""endangered species"" or ""demonstration"" stations.30 Each of these proposals would diminish interference protection to existing stations in the interest of creating more LPFM stations than would be allowed under our current rules. Amherst proposed that we establish ""endangered species"" exemptions where LPFM stations are few in number and face a high risk of displacement. This exception would, under Amherst's proposal, automatically be extended to an LPFM applicant who applied for an LP10 license and who seeks that license where no more than three LPFM licenses are available. Amherst's proposed demonstration stations would be permitted where there is no room for any LPFM stations under the current rules; they would be sited without 2nd adjacent channel separations and provide actual experience with such LPFM operations. ""Modified primary status"" would, like the other two proposals, diminish the protection we have granted to existing stations. We remain convinced that our analysis in the Report & Order struck an appropriate balance between the interest of new entrants and the importance of protection of existing broadcasters, and we decline to modify that balance. 30. Translators. FM translator stations may not continue to operate if any interference occurs in areas where a full service FM station has a ""regularly used"" signal, including locations beyond the full service station's applicable protected contour.31 However, LPFM stations are only required to protect subsequently authorized full service FM stations if interference is created within the full service station's  28 29 30 31  Black Petition at 1.

FM translators provide full service FM stations with a means of supplementing signal coverage made deficient due to terrain or other transmission issues, while LPFM stations will provide a new program origination service. Given the differing purposes of the LPFM and FM translator services we do not feel that it is necessary for both services to have identical interference protection requirements. 2. Modulation  31. In order to minimize the potential for interference from LPFM stations, the Commission concluded that LPFM stations would be required to meet current FM transmission standards. Additionally, in order to ensure that these standards are met, the Report and Order restricted LPFM stations to the use of FCC ""type certified"" transmitters.33  32. Craig L. Fox (Fox) argues that the rules adopted by the Commission are not sufficient to avoid the creation of interference via improper operation.34 Specifically, Fox argues that the adopted rules do not address the problem of overmodulation caused by a high audio feed. Fox states that overmodulation was a common problem among ""unlicensed operators"" and that excessive frequency deviation in the signals of these stations resulted in additional interference. Accordingly, Fox concludes that the Commission should require LPFM stations to use calibrated modulation monitors. We believe this additional safeguard is unwarranted. We do not believe that unsupported anecdotal evidence regarding unauthorized broadcasters is a sufficient justification for placing additional burdens on legitimate LPFM licensees. Thus, we find Fox's arguments unpersuasive and do not modify our prior determination to require full service and LPFM stations to meet the same transmission standards. 3. Cut-Off Date for Protection of Full Service Stations  33. The Report and Order adopted a nationwide filing window for LP100 applications and tentatively set the first window for May 2000. The Commission directed the Mass Media Bureau to announce by Public Notice the opening of the first national window and to release this notice at least 30 days in advance. Subsequently, the Mass Media Bureau decided to accept LPFM applications in five On reconsideration, we are expanding this protection to include the community of license of commercial FM stations and the community of license of NCE FM stations provided that community is within the station's 60 dBu contour. See  52. 32  ""In most cases, these standards will be met through the use of certified equipment without need for further adjustment by the LPFM licensee. LPFM stations will be required to adhere to the 200 kHz channel bandwidth applicable to full service stations, as well as the out-of-channel signal attenuation requirements in 47 C.F.R.  73.317 [via reference in  73.508], the center frequency drift limits in 47 C.F.R. 73.1545(b), and the limits on modulation in 47 C.F.R.  73.1570 (a) and (b)."" Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2248, 109. In this regard, we note that one of the rules modified in the Report and Order, 47 C.F.R.  73.1660, inadvertently specified verification rather than certification procedures for LPFM stations. We are correcting the rules accordingly to correspond to our decisions in the Report and Order. 34  33  Fox Petition.  14   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  separate filing windows to ""ensure the expeditious implementation of the LPFM service and to promote the efficient use of Commission resources.""35 The Report and Order also established protection rights for both full service and low power stations. LPFM applications must protect all full service FM station applications on file as of the date of the public notice in accordance with the minimum distance separation requirements adopted in the Report and Order. Full service FM applications filed on or after the public notice date would be protected only to the extent that the applicant's 3.16 mV/m contour is affected by an LPFM facility.36 34. Amherst Alliance concurs with our decision that LPFM applications must protect full service station applications on file as of a certain filing date. However, it disagrees with the date selected by the Commission. Specifically, Amherst argues that existing broadcasters will attempt to ""warehouse"" the spectrum by filing applications for the sole purpose of blocking LPFM applicants. Accordingly, Amherst suggests we change the ""grandfathered"" date to either February 26, 1999, the date the Commission required unlicensed broadcasters to cease operation if they wished to retain filing eligibility or, alternatively, January 20, 2000, the date of the adoption of the Report and Order.37 We decline to adopt a different ""cut-off"" date based on Amherst's speculative spectrum warehousing contention. We believe that we have adequate remedies to ensure that there will not be warehousing of spectrum.38 We have seen no evidence that broadcasters have chosen to circumvent Commission rules and policies by warehousing spectrum. Moreover, we conclude that imposing an extended freeze on full service applications would result in significant hardships to many stations without any countervailing benefits. We therefore reject this Amherst proposal. 35. However, in light of our decision to use multiple filing windows to implement the LPFM service, we clarify our LPFM cut-off rules. We will use the release date of each public notice announcing the opening of the next LP100 window as the ""cut-off"" date for protection of pending full service FM applications. Thus, LPFM applicants in subsequent filing windows will be required to protect all full service applications on file as of the date of the public notice for their particular window. This includes applications that may not have been protected in previous windows. 4. Protection of Cable Television Headend  36. NPR argues that the Commission should revise the LPFM rules to require that LPFM stations correct any interference that may occur in the vicinity of a cable television headend as a result of LPFM broadcasts. Of major concern to NPR are listeners that receive radio programming, including radio reading services which are typically transmitted on a radio station's subcarrier frequency, as part of  35  See Public Notice entitled ""FCC Announces Five-Stage National Filing Window for Low Power FM Broadcast Station Applications,"" released March 17, 2000, DA 00-621.

To the extent NPR refers to off-air reception problems caused by interference other than blanketing, we note that cable headend facilities receive no such specific protection from full service FM or FM translator stations. We are not persuaded that LPFM stations should be subject to more stringent requirements in this regard than other FM stations. 5. Translators  37. As part of its overall plan to protect FM stations from interference, the Commission adopted FM translator/booster-LPFM station minimum distance separation requirements. Because FM translator and booster stations generally do not have specific class limitations, the separation requirements were determined by analyzing the 60 dBu contours of authorized stations and grouping them into three cohorts based on station power and height. Additionally, we also amended Part 74 rules to require that FM translator and booster stations protect the 1 mV/m contour of LP100 stations.41 38. NPR complains that the Commission has adopted rules that have rendered FM translators ""secondary"" to LPFM stations. NPR cites the numerous federal Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants awarded to FM translator licensees each year as evidence of the recognized public interest benefits of translator service. According to NPR, this funding is provided because in many instances a translator station is the only source of public radio service in a given area.42 NPR argues that FM translator applicants that receive PTFP funding should not be required to protect LPFM stations. Additionally, NPR argues that LPFM station protection requirements may limit the ability of translators to relocate or change output frequencies when displaced by full service FM stations. It objects to this policy, contending that it could result in the potential loss of FM translator service. NPR requests that FM translators in this situation be allowed to make modifications that may result in interference to authorized LPFM stations. 39. We do not agree with NPR's characterization that the separation requirements adopted in the Report and Order make FM translators ""secondary"" to LPFM stations. The interference protections that were added to the translator and LPFM service rules place LPFM stations and FM translators on essentially equal footing in providing reciprocal interference protection. LPFM stations must meet FM translator distance separation minimums and FM translators must protect the 60 dBu contour of LP100 stations. We wish to clarify the application of 47 C.F.R.  74.1204(a)(4), the rule section requiring FM translators to protect the 60 dBu contour of co- and 1st adjacent channel LP100 stations. In issuing LPFM construction permits we will specify an acceptable range of ERP based on the proposed antenna HAAT. Any subsequently filed license authorization will include a specific operating ERP. An FM translator application must protect the maximum facility authorized in an LP100 construction permit until the LP100 station is licensed. In fact, some aspects of the rules provide greater protections for FM 39 40 41 42  NPR Petition at 16-17. Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2249,  113. Id. at 2233-34,  70-71. NPR Petition at 17-19  16   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  translator stations. For example, FM translators were divided into three broad categories based upon coverage area, with the same LPFM spacing applied to the smallest and largest facility in each category. Thus, with the exception of the largest authorized FM translator facilities, the spacing rules adopted for LPFM stations will usually result in an FM translator receiving more protection than an LP100 station which receives protection based on its actual contours. Additionally, FM translator stations are not required to protect LP10 stations. We believe that NPR's proposal to make LPFM stations secondary to translators is fundamentally contrary to current Commission policy, which treats translators as a secondary service. ""The proper role of FM translators among aural services to the public is to provide secondary service to areas in which direct reception of signals from FM broadcast stations is unsatisfactory due to distance or intervening terrain obstructions."" 43 We acknowledge that FM translators have provided useful service to unserved or underserved areas, but we believe that our LPFM rules adequately protect operating translator stations. We are not persuaded that our technical rules should be modified to eliminate the protections afforded LP100 stations  essentially rendering LPFM stations ""secondary"" to translators  either with respect to subsequently filed FM translator applications generally or with respect to the narrower class of translator stations that receive PTFP funding. 40. Nonetheless, we agree with NPR that maintaining translator-based delivery of broadcast programming is an important objective. We invite parties concerned with this issue to submit suggested improvements in these areas to the staff of the Mass Media Bureau's Audio Service Division, so that we can facilitate relocation of displaced translators when necessary. Based on the comments received the Bureau is authorized to reexamine our rules, filing procedures and processing standards and to suggest what steps the Commission can take to increase the flexibility accorded to displaced translator licensees seeking replacement facilities, if necessary. 41. NPR and the National Translator Association (NTA) state that the Commission should modify its rules to protect the input signals of FM translators that receive the signal of their primary stations via direct off-air reception.44 NPR is particularly concerned about the effects upon translator network ""chains"" in which each translator station output signal provides the input signal to the next. In this regard, we concur with the petitioners that protecting the input signals of FM translator stations is an important component of our overall policy goal of developing LPFM technical rules that protect existing FM translator service. We conclude that we should follow the procedures currently used to resolve allegations of interference caused by one FM translator to the input signal of another FM translator to resolve such interference caused by an LPFM station.45 However, contrary to NTA's suggestion, we will not make such interference a routine consideration prior to the grant of an application. Where a translator station demonstrates that an LPFM station is interfering with the translator station's input signal in use at the time the LPFM station is authorized, the LPFM station will be required immediately to cease operation until appropriate remedial actions have been taken. 42. Protection of Class A TV, Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations  43  See In the Matter of Amendment of the Commission's Rules Concerning FM Translator Stations, 5 FCC Rcd at 7219,  48 (1990). 44 45  NPR Petition at 21; NTA Petition at 3 . See 47 C.F.R.  74.1203(a)(2).  17   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  Operating on TV Channel 6. In order to protect TV Channel 6 stations from LPFM station interference, we adopted a rule (47 C.F.R.  73.825) requiring LPFM stations proposing operation in the NCE portion of the FM Band (Channels 201-220) to meet minimum distance separation requirements with respect to TV Channel 6 stations. 46 Section 73.825 does not specifically address Class A TV, low power television (LPTV) and television translator stations operating on TV Channel 6. Accordingly, we will amend  73.825 to include additional minimum distance separation requirements which we believe will be adequate to protect the service provided by the Class A TV, LPTV and television translator facilities. 47 6. Spacing Table.  43. An anomaly in the minimum distance separation requirements of 47 C.F.R.  73.807(g) has come to our attention. Specifically, the tables specify greater 2nd adjacent channel spacing requirements to Canadian stations from LP10 stations than from LP100 stations. When considering low-powered facilities at very high signal strengths, the Commission's F(50,50) curves often must be used instead of its F(50,10) curves. However, in some cases the staff must utilize the ""free space equation"" formula to determine contour distances. ""In those cases where the distance calculated from the free space equation is greater than 5280 feet [one mile], but the F(50,50) curves show a distance of less than one mile, we use a distance of one mile.""48 Although the staff properly used the treaty-required +20 dBu undesired-todesired signal radio to determine 2nd adjacent channel interfering contours near the Canadian border area, the staff failed to account for the fact that, in cases where the free space equation yields a result greater than 1.6 kilometers (one mile), 1.6 kilometers must be used as the contour distance. We have recalculated the minimum separation distances for 2nd adjacent channel LP10 stations near the Canadian border and are amending  73.807 accordingly.49 For the same reason, we are also amending the IF  46 47  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2249-50,  114.  The current distance requirements listed in  73.825 are premised upon a TV Channel 6 station operating with 100 kW ERP at 610 meters HAAT and the interference ratios proscribed by 47 C.F.R.  73.525. However, these requirements overstated the potential for interference created by LP10 and LP100 stations. Accordingly, we are amending  73.825 to eliminate this discrepancy. The requirements we are adopting for Class A TV, LPTV and television translator protection are based upon these stations operating with 3 kW ERP at 610 meters HAAT and the appropriate ratios of  73.525 and are thus much less restrictive than the requirements for protection of full service TV Channel 6 stations 48  ""And, if the distances involved are below one mile, it is necessary to use the free space equation to determine the signal strength of the undesired signal. The free space equation which we use is derived from `Radio Propagation at Frequencies above 30 Megacycles,' by Kenneth Bullington, Proceeding of the I.R.E., page 1122, October 1947. After taking into account the fact that FM broadcast antenna effective radiated power is referenced to half-wave dipole, rather than an isotropic antenna, we have: Distance (feet) = 23 Square Root (effective radiated power in watts) Field Strength (V/m)"" In re Application of City College of New York, 47 RR 2d 1095 (1980). 49  When conducting our review of the minimum separation requirements within the Canadian border zone we st became aware of a miscalculation in the requirements with respect to co- and 1 - adjacent channel Canadian Class C (continued....)  18   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  frequency separation requirements for Class LP100 stations with respect to Class A and Class D stations, and Class B stations in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. 44. In addition to the anomaly in 47 C.F.R.  73.807(g), we have determined that low power FM stations within Canada and Mexico 50 had not been specifically protected from new domestic LPFM stations in the Report and Order. While these stations are protected by treaty, the Report and Order failed to include spacing tables explicitly protecting Canadian and Mexican low power FM Stations. To eliminate any uncertainty with respect to Canadian and Mexican stations, we are supplementing the international spacing tables specified in 47 C.F.R.  73.807 to include specific distance separation requirements. To determine the spacings, we took the maximum facilities allowed for Canadian and Mexican FM translator stations, calculated the distance to the F(50,50) protected contour, and added the distance to the F(50,10) interfering curve from the domestic LPFM station required to protect those stations. In doing so, we determined that Canadian low power FM stations should receive the same protections provided to Canadian Class A1 facilities. Therefore, the Class A1 spacings in 47 C.F.R.  73.807(g)(1) & (g)(3) will also be used for protecting Canadian low power FM Stations. However, due to the differences in treaty requirements, Mexican low power FM stations require unique spacing distances, and 47 C.F.R.  73.807(g)(2) & (g)(4) are amended accordingly. 7. Directional Antennas  45. In the Report and Order we determined not to authorize directional antennas for LPFM stations.51 We concluded that directional antennas are unnecessary due to our reliance on a minimum distance separation methodology for interference protection, which assumes the use of a non-directional antenna. We also reasoned that authorizing only nondirectional antennas would simplify the preparation and processing of applications, thereby facilitating the expeditious implementation of the service. 46. The New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) and the consulting engineering firm of Lohnes and Culver request that LPFM stations be permitted to operate with directional antennas.52 They contend that directional antennas are useful engineering tools for enhancing a station's ability to avoid interference and for allowing more efficient operation by not wasting signal energy over unpopulated areas or areas where service is not intended. As suggested by Lohnes and Culver, use of a higher gain directional antenna to achieve a station's effective radiated power could reduce station costs by permitting the use of a lower power transmitter. NYSTA asserts that use of directional antennas would enable more opportunities for LPFM service, and that a blanket prohibition against directional antennas (Continued from previous page) stations. Accordingly we are modifying 73.807(g)(1) and (g)(3) to reflect the correct values. Additionally, we are clarifying 73.807(g)(6) to acknowledge the Commission's responsibility to coordinate with the appropriate government in all cases where such coordination is necessary to maintain compliance with existing international agreements. 50  The Treaties between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico refer to secondary facilities as ""Low Power FM Stations."" Low power FM Stations are authorized on a secondary basis in both Canada and Mexico, just as FM Translator stations are authorized in the United States. 51 52  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2248,  108. NYSTA Petition at 2-4; Lohnes and Culver Petition at 2.  19   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  is not sufficiently justified on the ground that it would simplify application requirements. 47. As we stated in the Report and Order, there are compelling needs for the services that will be provided by LPFM stations. As part of a streamlined application process to expedite the authorization and implementation of the service, we prohibited the use of directional antennas by LPFM stations. We continue to believe that given the low power levels in the LPFM service, authorizing stations to limit power in particular directions would not generally yield benefits sufficient to offset our concerns about the complexities of directional antenna authorizations. As noted by NYSTA, applicants seeking directional full service FM radio facilities are subject to strict requirements involving radiation pattern and antenna installation.53 Authorization of directional antennas entails the submission and staff evaluation of radiation patterns and related information. Applicants for directional FM station licenses are required to submit measurement data to verify the radiation characteristics of directional antennas, as installed. Station proposals involving non-directional antennas can be authorized more quickly and with much less information from applicants. Such antennas will also facilitate uniform signal coverage within an LPFM station's service contour. Moreover, the conservative distance separation requirements established for LPFM stations will ensure that other stations are adequately protected against interference without the use of directional antennas. For these reasons, we generally affirm our determination not to authorize directional antennas for LPFM stations. 48. As noted by the petitioners, however, we recognize that there could be tangible benefits to allowing the use of directional antennas, particularly for licensees whose service is generally tailored to directional signal paths. NYSTA notes that it, as well as transportation agencies of other states, operates a Traveler's Information Service (TIS) that provides travel advisory and public safety information to motorists. TIS systems include numerous stations strategically located to provide signal coverage along roadways. NYSTA seeks to replace AM radio TIS facilities with LPFM stations. According to NYSTA, use of directional antennas would ""focus coverage along the Thruway's right-of-way, thereby minimizing the stations' coverage contours and potential for interference, while still allowing the Thruway to ensure that its public safety information reaches the motorists using the roadway.""54 As suggested by Lohnes and Culver, directional antennas in such systems could reduce system costs and minimize environmental impact.55 49. For these reasons, we will make a limited exception to the prohibition of LPFM directional antennas and permit such antennas to be used only by public safety and transportation entities in connection with the operation of TIS services.56 However, under no circumstances will a specific 53  These requirements, given in 47 C.F.R.  73.316, include the submission of measurements of directional antenna relative field patterns to ensure the accuracy of radiated emissions. The determination and verification of directional antenna radiation characteristics can be exceedingly complicated, particularly for composite antenna systems comprised of multiple antennas. 54 55 56  NYSTA Petition at 1-3. Lohnes and Culver Petition at 3.  To enable such systems in the FM radio band, we are also providing a conditional exemption to government, public safety and transportation organizations to apply for multiple LPFM station licenses. See the discussion of National Ownership Limit at  77.  20   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  antenna pattern be considered when determining compliance with our LPFM interference requirements with respect to other stations. Thus, we affirm that all such applicants must propose LPFM locations that comply with the LPFM distance separation requirements; requirements which assume use of a nondirectional antenna. Additionally, the use of a directional antenna will not affect a licensee's obligation to operate at its authorized ERP and will therefore not result in any extension of predicted coverage. Use of a high gain directional antenna will require a corresponding transmitter output power and transmission line loss that produces the authorized ERP. 50. TIS applicants wishing to utilize directional antennas will be limited to the use of a single ""off-the-shelf"" antenna with pattern characteristics pre-set by the manufacturer. A composite antenna consisting of more than one antenna mounted together may not be utilized. Nor will we permit multiple directional antennas and transmitters to be used from a single licensed facility. When filing an application for license to cover a construction permit (FCC Form 319), permittees will be required to certify that the gain of the specified antenna and transmitter power output (TPO), coupled with the necessary transmission line, produces the licensed ERP.57 For the purposes of station authorizations and our engineering database, all LPFM stations, including those of TIS stations, will be considered ""nondirectional."" Thus, we will not require applicants for station licenses to submit any data beyond antenna make and model. We will expect all licensees to install their antennas in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. 8. Service Area Issues  51. In order to avoid the creation of interference to existing FM broadcast stations, the Report and Order adopted minimum distance separation requirements that were premised on the lack of prohibited overlap to each station class' maximum protected contour.58 In addition, in an effort to account for modifications to existing full service stations, and minimize interference, an additional 20 kilometer ""buffer"" was added to the co- and 1st adjacent channel separation requirements. Greater protection still was given to several superpowered stations operating within the reserved portion of the FM band.59 Finally, although a full service station proposing a facility modification could potentially be required to accept some interference from an operating LPFM station, the rules require that LPFM stations fully protect FM station modifications to their principal community (70 dBu) contours.60 52. Alan W. Jurison (Jurison) and NPR allege that the rules adopted by the Commission do not adequately protect the service areas of full service licensees.61 Both petitioners state that the  57  Applicants for LPFM construction permits are not required to specify antenna information on FCC Form  318. 58  The 1 mV/m contour for Class A, C3, C2, C1 and C stations; the .7 mV/m contour for Class B1 stations; and the .5 mV/m contour for Class B stations. 59 60 61  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2233,  70. Id. at 2231-32,  65-67. Jurison Petition at 3; NPR Petition at 6.  21   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  modification rule that requires LPFM stations to protect the 70 dBu contour of full power station modifications from interference appears to fall short of the Commission's stated intention of protecting the service areas of existing stations.62 We do not believe that reconsideration of these complementary policies is warranted. New LPFM station separation requirements and the protection afforded to full service modifications are intended to serve different aspects of our overall interference policy. The spacing rules require the full protection of all full power authorizations and prior-filed applications in order to minimize the potential for interference that could result from an initial LPFM station authorization. The Commission adopted a different approach to subsequently-filed modifications of full service stations in order to provide a degree of stability for the new and untested LPFM service while providing maximum technical flexibility for full power stations to initiate or enhance service. The Commission has long recognized the importance of preserving existing broadcast services. As a result, we believe the qualified cut-off protection that LPFM stations enjoy vis-a-vis subsequently filed full power proposals is warranted, especially when the role of LPFM stations in providing new outlets for community-based organizations is taken into account. We note that our decision to protect full power stations to maximum facilities and to require that new LPFM stations meet an additional buffer zone protection requirement should substantially limit the number of cases where a site relocation results in interference received by a full power station.63 53. NPR questions the use of the 70 dBu contour as a benchmark for protecting the community of license of noncommercial educational FM stations. Specifically, NPR argues that NCE FM stations operating within the reserved band are not required to cover their communities of license with a 70 dBu strength signal. Thus, under the LPFM rules as originally adopted, a full service NCE FM station could receive interference from an LPFM station within those portions of its community of license that it serves with less than a city grade strength signal. We concur that this result does not serve our intended goal of protecting service within each station's community of license.64 Accordingly, we will revise the pertinent rule sections to require that LPFM stations not cause interference within the community of license of an NCE FM station, provided that the community is within the 60 dBu contour of the affected NCE FM station. Extending this protection to stations with communities of license located beyond the 60 dBu contour is not warranted since such stations are already potentially subject to interference from other full service stations within their communities of license. Commercial FM stations are deemed to ""substantially comply"" with the community of license coverage requirements if at least 80% of the community of license is located within the 70 dBu contour.65 Accordingly, we will also protect the 62  See 47 C.F.R.  73.209(c) (Protection from interference);  73.514 (Protection from interference); and  73.809 (Interference Protection for full service FM stations). 63  We wish to clarify 47 C.F.R.  73.809 as it relates to determining interference caused by LPFM stations to full service stations operating on IF frequency channels. That section states that interference will be shown by demonstrating contour overlap based upon the interference ratios of 47 C.F.R.  73.215. However,  73.215 does not apply to IF frequency channel stations. Accordingly, we are amending  73.809 to state that IF frequency channel interference will be determined via overlap of the 91 dBu F(50,50) (36 mV/m) contours. This contour was utilized to calculate the LPFM IF frequency channel spacing requirements. 64  See In the Matter of 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review  Streamlining of Radio Technical rules in parts 73 and 74 of the Commission's Rules, (13 FCC Rcd 14849, 14875-76,  57-58 (1998)). 65  See John R. Hughes, 50 Fed. Reg. 5679 (1985).  22   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  community of license of commercial FM stations, even in instances where a portion is located outside the 70 dBu contour. 54. NPR has expressed additional concerns about the service areas of NCE FM stations. NPR is concerned that, although the Commission indicated that the distance separation requirements often result in greater protection to stations operating with less than maximum class facilities, stations operating at maximum class facilities do not receive any ""additional"" protection.66 We do not share NPR's concern in this regard. The ""additional protection"" referred to by NPR is simply a consequence of using a minimum distance separation methodology based upon maximum class facilities instead of a contour overlap methodology based upon actual authorized facilities.67 Additionally, NPR expresses concern that stations operating in statewide networks are vulnerable to interference because ""[i]ndividual stations in a statewide network are typically sited to achieve maximum population based upon the receipt of a quality signal rather than predicted contour overlap.""68 With the exception of the 20 kilometer ""buffer"" added to the co- and 1st adjacent channel spacing requirements, the Commission did not provide for protections beyond stations' service areas based on maximum facilities for the station class. More generally, it is axiomatic that our technical rules protect NCE stations only to their ""protected"" contours and not some undefined otherwise unprotected contour relating to the location of a desired station audience. Requiring greater protection could unduly limit LPFM licensing opportunities and is at odds with protections provided in the full power service. We conclude that this fundamental departure from our license assignment policies is unwarranted. 55. Jurison also expressed concern about existing grandfathered superpowered FM stations operating in the non-reserved band.69 Specifically, Jurison states that the Commission did not explain why non-reserved band superpowered stations were not granted the additional protections provided for reserved band superpowered stations. 70 Under current Commission rules, superpowered stations operating within the non-reserved band are protected not on the basis of their actual facilities but on the basis of the station's maximum class facilities.71 In contrast, full service superpowered stations operating within the reserved band are protected on the basis of their authorized facilities, which exceed the maximum facilities for the station class.72 Jurison has not established sufficient justification for requiring LPFM stations to provide non-reserved band superpowered stations with greater protection than that currently provided by existing full service stations. Jurison also expresses concern that LPFM stations 66 67 68 69  NPR Petition at 9. Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2228,  58. NPR Petition at 10.  ""Superpowered"" FM stations have been authorized to operate with facilities that exceed the ERP/HAAT limitations of 73.211 or 73.511 for their specific class of station. 70 71  Jurison Petition at 2-3.  All full service stations operating in the non-reserved band, regardless of facilities, must be protected under the provisions of 47 C.F.R.  73.207 (distance separations based upon maximum class facilities) or  73.215 (lesser separation requirements based upon the lack of contour overlap with maximum class facilities). 72  See 47 C.F.R.  73.509.  23   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  would receive excessive interference from superpowered stations, despite being located at distances where our rules73 state that there would be ""no interference received."" While this situation may occur in some instances, we do not believe that it warrants increasing the LPFM minimum separation requirements toward all superpowered stations. LPFM minimum distance separation requirements may permit stations to operate in areas where they may be subject to received interference. To the extent that the ""no interference received"" values may be misleading in some instances, we will change the tables to read ""For No Interference Received From Maximum Class Facility."" It will be the LPFM applicant's responsibility to consider the facilities of nearby superpowered stations when considering its choices for site and/or frequency. 9. Digital Audio Broadcasting  56. The Commission's decision to retain 2nd adjacent channel LPFM protection requirements but eliminate 3rd adjacent channel standards was designed, in part, to ensure that the introduction of the LPFM service did not impede the development of in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital audio broadcasting (DAB) technologies. Both USA Digital Radio Partners, L.P. (USADR) and Lucent Digital Radio (LDR) have expressed concerned about the robustness of their technologies with respect to 2nd adjacent channel signals, including LPFM signals. However, neither proponent raised concerns about 3rd adjacent channel operations and USADR has stated that ""digital reception is essentially not susceptible to 3rd adjacent channel interference.""74 On this basis, the Commission concluded that the LPFM operations on 3rd adjacent channels will not have an adverse impact on digital IBOC signals.75 57. Neither USADR nor LDR seeks reconsideration of our decision not to establish 3rd adjacent channel protection standards for LPFM stations. NPR, however, argues that the technical standards adopted in the Report and Order fail adequately to assure the compatibility of LPFM and a future DAB service. It urges the Commission to retain full service 3rd adjacent channel interference protections or to authorize LPFM stations ""on a secondary basis to all full power, translator, and booster stations operating pursuant to a DAB authorization.""76 We believe that such additional restrictions on LPFM licensing are unwarranted. The Report and Order takes a technically conservative approach to minimize potential impacts on terrestrial digital radio services. The retention of 2nd adjacent channel protections, the additional 20-kilometer buffer zone protection afforded all full service stations operating on co- and 1st adjacent channels, and the decision not to create a 1000-watt class of LPFM stations collectively demonstrate the Commission's commitment to ensuring a smooth transition to DAB. We believe that we have incorporated sufficient protections into our LPFM technical rules and, therefore, reaffirm our prior conclusion that LPFM is very unlikely to impede the development of a DAB service or cause interference in particular cases to digital IBOC signals.  73 74 75 76  47 C.F.R.  73.807.

Third Adjacent Channel Complaint and License Modification Procedure  58. Based on the Commission's technical analyses and its review of several independent studies submitted in this proceeding we decided not to require LPFM stations to provide 3rd adjacent channel protection to full power stations. As discussed above, no issues have been raised on reconsideration that have persuaded us to reconsider our findings and conclusions on this matter.77 We continue to believe that the risk of interference from LPFM stations is small, and that the interference that may occur in individual cases would be vastly outweighed by the benefits of initiating a new service that will create new outlets for locally based community-oriented voices. 59. National Public Radio (NPR) urges the Commission to adopt an expedited process for the review of complaints of alleged interference to full power stations caused by LPFM stations operating on third adjacent channels. NPR proposes a pre-license complaint procedure, stating that ""the Commission should implement a process that permits the challenge and denial of an LPFM application on a 3rd adjacent channel at the initial processing stage...""78 In the alternative, however, NPR proposes that the Commission adopt rules that would allow a ""licensee of a full power, translator, or booster station to file an interference complaint at any time after final licensing of the facility LPFM operation.""79 60. As a preliminary matter, we reject NPR's pre-license predicted interference complaint procedure because it is in fundamental conflict with our conclusion that the benefits of this new service far outweigh the isolated instances of interference that may occur. We continue to adhere to this policy judgment. Our studies establish that FM receiver performance varies widely. Many receivers are highly immune to 3rd adjacent channel interference while poorer quality receivers may experience some additional interference from the operation of LPFM stations. Moreover, as noted in the Report and Order, any interference would most likely occur in a small area in the immediate vicinity of the LPFM transmission facility that is, itself, located at the outer edge of a full power FM station's service area. Listeners using low-end receivers are unlikely to experience ""actual interference"" in such a situation because in locations at the outer edge of a station's service area those receivers probably are not able to receive that station. 61. We concluded in the Report and Order that the licensing of LPFM stations on 3rd adjacent channels would not result in significant new interference to existing FM stations, i.e. that very few listeners would be able to detect additional interference as a result of commencement of LPFM service on a 3rd adjacent channel. Although we expect it to be the rare case where an LPFM station operating on a 3rd adjacent channel causes more than a de minimis level of interference within the service area of a full power station protected by the distance separation requirements for other channel relationships, such a result would be unacceptable if it were to occur. Accordingly, we conclude on reconsideration that it would be prudent to establish procedures that would encourage cooperation between the parties and permit the Commission to take prompt remedial action where a significant level of interference can be traced to the commencement of broadcasts by a new LPFM station. As a result of these new procedures, 77 78 79  See discussion in  5-18. NPR Petition at 13. Id.  25   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  there may be circumstances where, contrary to what we said in the Report and Order,80 an LPFM station will be required to take steps to resolve complaints that its signal is interfering with the reception of a full power FM station even though the LPFM station is operating in accordance with the relevant rules. 62. This marks the first time that the Commission has departed from a purely ""predicted interference"" approach for an aural service that has program origination authority and that enjoys certain protections generally thought of as ""primary"" stations rights. Our willingness to do so is based on a unique combination of factors. Most importantly, we are confident about the technical conclusions we have reached in the proceeding. Specifically, we continue to believe that it is unlikely that more than a few listeners will detect any additional interference to the reception of an existing FM station at locations that would be entitled to protection under our full power third adjacent channel interference methodology. Thus, the post-construction ""actual interference"" complaint procedure we are establishing should not pose a significant threat to the viability or stability of the LPFM service. 63. Moreover, an efficient complaint procedure will promote the fullest interference-free use of the FM broadcast spectrum. At this time there are few, if any, full power FM station opportunities in most of the highly populated areas of the country. In fact, staff studies in this proceeding establish that there are no available FM channels for LP100 stations in a number of major markets. In many communities broadcasters have fully taken advantage of the Commission's policy of licensing efficient high-power stations that serve wide areas with limited technical preclusiveness. As a result, most Americans enjoy abundant radio service. LPFM is not, as some argue, in conflict with these principles. Rather it is a complementary way to serve the needs of communities within a mature broadcast service. It is grounded on the success of the Commission's licensing policies and is designed to efficiently match the little spectrum that remains with the demonstrable demand for locally based programming. We conclude that an efficient, limited complaint procedure fairly balances the interests of incumbent broadcasters against the benefits of fostering a new and different kind of radio service. 64. For purposes of the complaint process we will consider interference to occur whenever reception of a full power station is impaired by the operation of an LPFM station operating on a third adjacent channel station. We believe that it is unnecessary to adopt a more technically objective standard for determining whether a listener is experiencing ""actual"" interference. The ""any impairment"" standard has worked successfully over the past decade in the FM translator context.81 A particular listener's perception of signal impairment is dependent on many factors, including the receiver used, the programming, listener sound quality expectations, and listener auditory discrimination capabilities. As a result, we are reluctant to adopt a single ""objectionable interference"" standard. We are also concerned that this approach could add a level of factual complexity to the complaint process set forth below without any clear public interest justification. 65. The complaint process may be invoked where an LPFM station's transmission facilities are located inside the predicted 60 dBu contour of an existing full power FM station operating on a 3rd  80 81  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2282,  64. See 47 C.F.R.  74.1203.  26   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  adjacent channel82; that is, the 60 dBu contour corresponding to the station facilities that existed at the time construction of the LPFM station was authorized.83 Complaints will be limited to receivers located at fixed, identifiable locations within the full power station's 60 dBu contour that are not more than one kilometer from the LPFM transmitter site. This geographic limitation is intended to address broadcasters' specific concern about the lack of LPFM station 3rd adjacent channel interference protection requirements. An LPFM station's interfering contour would extend slightly less than one kilometer from the LPFM transmitter site.84 The fixed receiver requirement is based on our desire to put in place a manageable and efficient complaint procedure. Mobile receiver complaints are generally much more difficult to identify and resolve. A mobile receiver, such as a car or portable radio, will encounter constantly varying signal strengths from various stations, resulting in a continuously variable potential for interference.85 The complaint must be received by either the LPFM or full power station within one year of the date on which the LPFM station commenced operation. This time frame is necessary to limit uncertainty regarding the potential modification or cancellation of an LPFM station's license and such station's financial obligation to resolve interference complaints. Any interference caused by the LPFM station should be detectable within one year after it commences operation. The one-year cure period is similar to the technical requirement that each FM permittee resolve at its sole expense all blanketing interference complaints for a one-year period beginning with the commencement of program tests.86 The Commission will consider the modification of a station's license, including its cancellation, where as a result of the process described below, bona fide complaints from at least one percent of the households or thirty households, whichever is less, within the specified complaint area remain unresolved.87 We do not 82 83  Predicted 60 dBu contours must be calculated in accordance with 47 C.F.R.  73.313(a). rd  That contour, which encompasses the area that would have been protected had a 3 adjacent channel distance separation requirement been applied to LPFM stations, will bound the complaint area. With regard to rd LPFM protection of subsequently modified, upgraded, or new full-service FM stations, we will conform 3 adjacent channel protection responsibilities to the generally applicable provisions in  66 of the Report and Order and as codified in 47 C.F.R.  73.809. In this manner, operating LPFM stations will be permitted to interfere within the 60 dBu contour of a new or subsequently modified FM station, but not within such a station's 70 dBu ""city grade"" signal contour or principal community of license, as applicable (see discussion of service area issues, above). Under the Commission's interference methodology for FM stations, 3 adjacent channel interference is rd predicted where the undesired signal is more than 40 dB stronger than the desired signal level , e.g., where the 3 adjacent channel station's 100 dBu contour overlaps the desired signal level. See, e.g., 47 C.F.R.  73.509. The predicted 100 dBu contour of an LPFM station operating at maximum facilities would extend slightly less than one kilometer from the LPFM's transmitter site. 85 84 rd  Because of these complexities, the Commission generally does not hold an FM radio station responsible for alleviating interference problems caused to mobile receivers. 86 87  See 47 C.F.R.  73.318.  The exact number of complaints necessary to satisfy this one-percent threshold can only be calculated on the basis of a specific antenna location of an allegedly interfering LPFM station. Assuming uniform population distribution within a community of license, the number of complaints necessary to reach this threshold would be, for example, approximately 19 in Charlottesville, Virginia, 29 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and 12 in Frederick, Maryland. As noted above, in no event would this procedure require more than 30 bona fide complaints.  27   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  anticipate this level of interference as a result of licensing LPFM stations on 3rd adjacent channels and will not consider it de minimis. 66. The first stage of the complaint process is designed to facilitate cooperative efforts between LPFM and full power FM licensees to identify and resolve bona fide interference complaints. A listener who believes that an LPFM station signal is interfering with the reception of a full power station may initiate the complaint procedure by providing the full power station an affidavit that describes the nature and location of the alleged interference. LPFM stations receiving complaints directly from listeners will be required to forward promptly such complaints to the affected full power FM stations. The full power FM station will be required to identify those complainants who reside at locations covered by these procedures, and provide copies of all such bona fide complaints to the LPFM station. Initially, an LPFM station will have the opportunity to resolve individual interference complaints. For example, an LPFM station may agree to provide new receivers to impacted listeners or to install filters at the receiver site. The LPFM station also may wish to consider a power reduction or other facility modification to alleviate the interference. We expect the LPFM station to make serious and diligent efforts to resolve each bona fide complaint received. 67. In the event that the LPFM station concludes that it is not the source of the interference and the number of unresolved complaints equals at least one percent of households or 30 households -whichever is less -- in the complaint area, the LPFM and full power stations must cooperate in an ""on-off test"" to determine whether the interference is traceable to the LPFM station. To the extent necessary and where practical, we instruct our Enforcement Bureau field personnel to assist the parties in determining the source of the interference and identifying possible solutions. The Commission will consider a complaint resolved if the complainant does not reasonably cooperate with the LPFM station's investigatory and remedial efforts. If the licensees fail to reach agreement and the requisite number of complaints remain unresolved, the full power FM station licensee may request that the Commission initiate a proceeding to consider whether the LPFM station's license should be modified or cancelled. To expedite this process, LPFM licenses will include a condition permitting the Commission to modify or cancel such licenses where the Commission determines that the LPFM station is causing more than de minimis levels of 3rd adjacent channel interference to the reception of a full power FM station in the complaint area, i.e., where the number of bona fide complaints meets or exceeds the one-percent-ofhouseholds or thirty-households threshold set forth above. This modification procedure will be conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C.  316 and any such modification proceeding will be completed within 90 days of the filing of the complaint with the Commission, provided that the parties may seek extensions of this deadline consistent with our procedural rules. 68. An LPFM station may stay this procedure by voluntarily ceasing operations and filing a ""displacement"" application on Form 318 within twenty days of the commencement of this modification procedure. A displacement application may propose a station relocation and/or channel change to any available channel. It will be treated as a ""minor"" change that is not subject to competing applications, provided that a requested LP100 station site change is not greater than 2 kilometers or, in the case of an LP10 station, 1 kilometer. C. Classes of Service  69. The Report and Order established two classes of LPFM stations. LP100 stations will be authorized to operate with maximum facilities of 100 watts effective radiated power (ERP) at 30 meters (100 feet) antenna height above average terrain (HAAT). LP10 stations will be licensed with the 28   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  equivalent of 10 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT. The Commission declined to create a 1000 watt class of low power stations because of potential interference concerns, and because it determined that LP100 and LP10 stations would create more opportunities for community-oriented service.88 70. Skinner urges us to reconsider our decision not to authorize 1000 watt stations, because he believes that restricting LPFM stations to lower power operation will adversely affect their economic viability. He argues that 1000 watt stations should be allowed in areas where it could be shown that operation would be possible without the creation of prohibited contour overlap.89 We continue to believe for the reasons stated in the Report and Order that the combination of LP100 and LP10 stations will best promote the goals of a community-based radio service.90 Moreover, we believe that our reasons for rejecting a contour protection methodology for protecting stations from interference 91 is even more compelling with regard to higher power LPFM stations. Skinner has not provided any additional information that would lead us to reconsider these conclusions. 71. Our conclusion that licensing these two classes of service at this time would serve the public interest is warranted by changes in the radio industry. In the past we have struck the balance in favor of licensing higher powered stations to ensure that large audiences were served.92 Now, when radio service is widely available throughout the country and very little spectrum remains available for new full-powered stations, we conclude that licensing very low powered stations will fill in the gaps in the spectrum that would otherwise go unused. This will maximize the use of the available spectrum, rather than create the inefficiencies we sought to avoid in the past.93 Consistent with this approach, we are licensing LP100 stations before LP10 stations. As we stated in the Report and Order, [w]e adopt this sequential process in order to provide the larger (100 watt) stations with their greater service areas the first opportunity to become established. Given that some LP10 stations can be sited where LP100 stations cannot, we expect that opportunities will remain for LP10 stations after the initial demand for LP100 stations has been accommodated. Additionally, our own resources will be better spent first advancing services to relatively greater areas.""94 Our decision to begin licensing low power FM radio 88 89 90 91 92  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2211,  11.

Dunifer, 11 FCC Rcd 718,  15 (1995). At this time, however, we are creating an LPFM service that is designed to allow small stations to operate where full powered stations cannot. Moreover, we have adopted rules to ensure that the operation of LPFM stations does not undermine the technical integrity of the existing FM radio service. 94  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2211,  11 (emphasis added).  29   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  stations at this time is also in response to the dramatic changes in the radio industry during the last four years since our radio multiple ownership limits were relaxed pursuant to the 1996 Act.95 Given the substantial consolidation of radio station ownership in recent years, the need for adding diverse voices to the airwaves has grown. Because we have concluded that taking this step will not undermine our spectrum efficiency goals, we affirm our decision to create these two new classes of FM radio service. D. Noncommercial Nature of LPFM Service  72. In the Report and Order, we determined that only noncommercial educational entities would be eligible to hold LPFM licenses. Skinner argues that restricting the service to noncommercial service reduces LPFM stations' economic viability and eliminates a potential advertising medium for small businesses.96 73. Our goals in establishing the LPFM service were to create opportunities for new voices on the airwaves and to allow local groups, including schools, churches, and other community-based organizations, to provide programming responsive to local community needs and interests.97 As discussed extensively in the Report and Order, although we considered the entrepreneurial opportunities a commercial LPFM service would create, we concluded that a noncommercial service would best serve the Commission's goals in this proceeding. Skinner has not persuaded us to alter that decision. 74. Amherst Alliance requests that the Commission clarify that ""entertainment""98 programming can qualify as ""educational"" under the Commission's rules.99 As discussed in the Report and Order, we have not required that programming be exclusively educational for an entity to qualify as an NCE entity eligible for non-commercial licenses.100 In 1998 the Commission stated with regard to full power NCE stations that ""NCE stations must promote a primarily educational purpose and not air commercials. Within those limits, there are many programming choices on NCE stations, such as instructional programs, programming selected by students, bible study, cultural programming, in-depth news coverage, 95  The 1996 Act eliminated the Commission's national ownership limits and relaxed the local radio ownership limits. In response, the radio industry has consolidated ownership during the past four years, with the number of radio owners declining by approximately 1000. In 1996, the largest radio group owner had fewer than 40 radio stations nationwide. In March 2000, the two largest radio group owners each have over 440 radio stations, and there are several radio owners with more than 100 radio stations. Approximately two-thirds of all commercial radio stations are owned as a part of radio groups.

Specific questions were raised as to whether Indian tribes may apply for LPFM stations, or whether only their educational institutions may apply. As long as they meet the NCE criteria and other eligibility rules applicable to all applicants, Indian tribes may apply for LPFM construction permits. We have granted NCE radio station licenses to Indian tribes and to educational institutions operated by Indian tribes and thus, this LPFM eligibility rule follows current policy. We will apply the NCE criteria to Indian tribe applicants -- and all applicants -- in the same manner in LPFM as we have in the existing FM radio service. E. Ownership and Eligibility 1. Local Ownership Restrictions  76. In the Report and Order we prohibited common ownership of more than one LPFM station in the same area and cross-ownership of any LPFM by any other broadcast station, including translator and low power television stations, as well as other media subject to our ownership rules.102 Lawson & Langford request that AM licensees be permitted to file LPFM applications, in part, they argue, because of the higher number of minorities that are AM station licensees.103 As discussed extensively in the Report and Order,104 we believe that strict ownership rules are an important mechanism for assuring the diversity of ownership that is so critical to this service. We concluded that the interest in bringing new voices to the airwaves would be best served by barring cross-ownership between LPFM licensees and existing broadcast owners and other media entities. We believe that the rules we have adopted for the LPFM service -- including the strict cross ownership ban -- will lead to more access by all segments of the population to the airwaves. We will, therefore, maintain the cross-ownership restrictions set forth in the Report and Order. 105 As noted in the Report and Order, if a licensee of an AM station (or any other station) agrees to divest its interest in its license upon grant of the LPFM license, it may apply for an LPFM license. 77. Cohn & Marks ask us to clarify that an entity may hold both an ITFS license and an LPFM license. Cohn & Marks state that many universities and colleges hold ITFS stations, which transmit a signal to fixed receiving locations and may only be used to transmit formal educational programming offered for credit to enrolled students of accredited schools. We clarify that ITFS is neither a broadcast Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, In the Matter of Reexamination of the Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants, 13 FCC Rcd 21167, 21168 (n.2) (1998). 102 103 104 105 101  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2216-18,  26-30.

National Ownership Limit  78. The Commission established a staged national ownership rule. For the first two years after a filing window opens, an entity may own only one LPFM station. After the first two years we will allow one entity to own up to five stations nationwide; after three years, we will allow an entity to own up to ten stations nationwide. The purpose of this staged approach is to foster diversity by initially disallowing common ownership of LPFM stations, but eventually permitting common ownership where local applicants fail to come forward.107 As noted above, since adoption of the Report and Order we adopted staggered filing windows based on geographic regions. We clarify that this two year limitation -- as well as other time periods tied to the opening of a filing window -- will begin to run in a geographic region based on the opening of that region's filing window. 79. Public Safety and Transportation. In addition to NCEs, state or local governments or notfor-profit organizations that operate public safety or emergency services108 are also eligible owners for LPFM licenses.109 The NYSTA requests that the Commission relax the national ownership rules to allow such government, public safety and transportation entities, such as itself, to hold multiple licenses.110 It argues that in order to disseminate traffic, safety, and other information over a large geographic area, these entities should be able to operate a string of stations along certain roadways. Upon reconsideration, we will allow government, public safety and transportation entities to apply for more than one license without waiting for the expiration of the two year period where no mutually exclusive application is filed in the same window. We agree that government, public safety and transportation agencies have separate and distinct needs from other local organizations that might seek LPFM licenses.111 However, we need to  106  The Commission has maintained that ITFS licensees are not broadcasters for the purposes of regulation. 47 U.S.C.  153(o). 107 108  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2222,  39.  These eligible services are defined in Section 309(j)(2)(A) of the Communications Act as ""public safety radio services, including private internal radio services used by State and local governments and non-government entities and including emergency road services provided by not-for-profit organizations, that  (i) are used to protect the safety of life, health, or property; and (ii) are not made commercially available to the public."" 47 U.S.C.  309(j)(2)(A). 109  NPR argues that the Commission authorized LPFM ""travel advisory services"" without consideration of the technical and feasibility issues relevant to such a service. NPR Petition at 6. These entities will have to comply with the technical rules applicable to all LPFM licenses; thus, we have no reason to believe this use of the service will cause technical difficulties. As to feasibility issues, we trust that the entities themselves can best determine whether LPFM licenses will serve their needs. 110  NYSTA Petition at 4 and 6 (seeking relaxation of 10-station national cap as well as 2-year 1-station national cap and phase-in caps). 111  NYSTA Petition at 7.  32   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  balance those needs with our goal of LPFM ownership diversity. We believe that allowing a limited exception to the ownership restrictions for government, public safety and transportation entities where they do not face competing applications strikes the right balance. 80. Thus, we will allow government, public safety and transportation organizations to apply for more than one license, but they must designate a ""priority"" application among those applications. The ""priority"" application will undergo the usual selection process as outlined in the Report and Order whether or not it encounters mutually exclusive applicants. The other applications they submit will be dismissed if they are mutually exclusive with any other applications but will be eligible for grant in the absence of competing applications. 81. Schools with Multiple Campuses. Several schools with multiple campuses sought clarification of the national ownership rules to permit the separate licensing of LPFM stations at several campuses. We believe the LPFM attribution exception should be expanded to cover separate school campuses in most cases, allowing schools to have LPFM stations on separate campuses notwithstanding our national ownership rule.112 For example, if several high schools in an area seek LPFM licenses but are all governed by a local school board, the high schools can assert that they are local chapters of a large organization and can apply for their own licenses. If multiple campuses of the same university apply for LPFM licenses, they too would be considered separate local entities under that exception. The same principle will apply to charter schools that are a part of a larger school system but seek their own licenses. 3. University-Licensed Student-Run LPFM Stations  82. As noted above, in the Report and Order, we determined that no broadcaster or other media entity subject to our ownership rules, or any party with an attributable interest in a broadcaster or media entity subject to our ownership rules, could hold an attributable ownership interest in an LPFM licensee.113 Moreover, we restricted local ownership, allowing an entity to own only one LPFM station in a community.114 Finally, for purposes of our national ownership limits, an entity may own only one LPFM station during the first two years of LPFM service.115  112  This LPFM exception is inapplicable to full service NCE stations, for which there are no national ownership limits. Schools with multiple campuses applying for full service NCE stations are directed to the definition of attribution and the selection standards in 47 C.F.R.  73.7000 and  73.7003.

Id. makes up a require that each other. 115  Id. at 2222,  39. While we will disallow common ownership of LPFM stations for the first two years of LPFM service, we will permit multiple ownership of LPFM stations nationally, up to a maximum of 10 LPFM stations over a phased-in period, to bring into use whatever low power stations remain available but unapplied for. Id.  33   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  83. Two petitioners ask us to create an exception to these LPFM multiple and cross-ownership rules to allow universities that hold full-power FM radio licenses to obtain LPFM licenses for student-run stations.116 Specifically, petitioners contend that our LPFM ownership rules preclude students from operating a university-licensed LPFM station where the university already holds licenses for radio broadcast stations, including NPR affiliated stations. Petitioners argue that students are not permitted to participate in the operation of these full-power stations and that our LPFM ownership rules deny students the opportunity to operate LPFM stations.117 UCC supports an exception for student organizations cautioning the Commission ""to place strict limits on what constitutes a student-run station,"" but not to ""limit university support for student-run LPFM stations.""118 84. We will allow universities that hold licenses for full-power broadcast stations that are not student-run to apply for LPFM licenses for stations that would be managed and operated on a day-to-day basis by students, provided that they do not face any competing applications. We find that allowing this limited exception to our LPFM ownership rules will promote our goals of maximizing diversity of ownership in a community and providing a medium for new speakers, including students, to gain experience in the broadcast field. Accordingly, if a university's full-power station does not provide the university's students with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the management and operation of that station, we will allow the university to apply for a license for a student-run LFPM station on that campus.119 If a license is granted, the station must be managed and operated by students of the university, although as the licensee, the University must retain ultimate control of the station's operations. Black Petition; Petition for Reconsideration of Michael Camarillo, on Behalf of KAMP Student Radio of the University of Arizona (Camarillo Petition). Black argues that because the Board of Regents for the University of Wisconsin holds licenses for campus stations and NPR affiliates at various campuses in the University of Wisconsin system, our ownership rules ""disenfranchise"" those students who would like to obtain an LPFM license for the Madison campus. Black Petition at 1-2.

See  80 (stating that individual campuses of a single university system would be considered a separate local entity under the attribution exception for national or other large organizations). We note that many AM campus radio systems use carrier current technology where the radio signal is carried along electrical power lines. In the Matter of 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review  Conducted Emissions Limits Below 30 MHz for Equipment Regulated under Parts 15 and 18 of the Commission's Rules, ET Docket No. 98-80, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 98-102, 1998 WL 292826,  5 (June 8, 1998); 47 C.F.R.  15.3(f). The exception we are creating today to our ownership rules applies where the university already holds a license for a full-power broadcast station that does not provide students with the opportunity to manage and operate the station. We will not consider campus carrier current systems in determining whether to grant an LPFM license under this exception because those systems are neither broadcasters nor other media entities subject to our ownership rules.  34   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  However, in those cases where a university already holds an attributable interest in a broadcast station, its LPFM application will be eligible for grant only if it does not face competing applications. If the university is a licensee and its LPFM application faces a competing application, the university's LPFM application will be dismissed.120 We believe this exception properly balances the interests of local groups in acquiring a first broadcast facility and of university licensees that desire to provide a distinct media outlet for students. 4. Time Periods for the Community-Based Requirement and for the National Ownership Cap  85. In the Report and Order, the Commission established a two-year time period during which only local, community-based applicants are eligible, and an entity can only own one station nationwide. UCC asks that we extend both of these time periods in order to give more local groups enough time to organize and submit their applications.121 86. We deny UCC's request based requirement and the national cap. and Order and concluded that we struck the interest in insuring that the service is that we extend the two-year time periods for the communityWe considered UCC's concerns when we adopted the Report an appropriate balance between the interests of local groups and used fully.  87. When deciding on the two-year time period for the community-based requirement, we weighed our interest in putting LPFM stations into the hands of local and diverse entities against our interest in ensuring that available spectrum does not go unused. As noted above, we have adopted a staggered filing window approach for accepting LPFM applications based on geographic region. We clarify that the two-year period for the community-based requirement for each jurisdiction starts on the date of the filing window for that jurisdiction. Therefore, in Alaska, California, District of Columbia, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Mariana Islands, Maryland, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Utah, for which we opened a filing window on May 30, 2000, the two-year period began running on that date. In the remainder of the jurisdictions, in which LPFM filing windows have not yet opened, the two-year period has not yet begun to run. Thus, applicants in these jurisdictions that have not yet had a filing window will have additional time to organize and prepare their applications. Amherst argues that it will take longer than two years for groups to organize themselves and apply for licenses. We believe that the simplified application process we created for LPFM will ameliorate this concern. 88. With regard to the two-year time period for the national ownership cap, UCC argues that national entities do not have the ""experience and connections with a tiny 3 or 7 mile area of a 120  We note that our decision is based on petitioners' request that the university be able to hold the student-run LPFM license. Black argues that the university must hold the license to provide the students with the ""oversight, continuity, and institutional support they need."" Black Petition at 1. Specifically, Black asserts that the university must be able to insure the station and provide students with needed legal advice. Id. While this exception applies to the situation where a university holds a license for a full-power broadcast station that does not provide students with the opportunity to manage and operate the station, we note that students or student organizations may apply for an LPFM license that is not associated with the university. 121  UCC Petition at 4.  35   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  neighborhood necessary to serve that neighborhood.""122 They seem to be arguing against allowing national entities to hold licenses at all, rather than arguing against the two-year time period for the national ownership cap. Amherst's arguments do not convince us that our decision to maintain a twoyear time period was imprudently made. 5. Foreign Ownership and Non-Stock Entities  89. Questions have arisen with respect to the application of statutory foreign ownership requirements to LPFM applicants and licensees. As we explained in the Notice,123 all low-power facilities will be subject to the statutory requirements of Section 310(b) of the Act, which limits foreign ownership and voting interests in radio station licenses, including broadcast licenses.124 Sections 310(b)(1) and (b)(2) prohibit the grant of a license to a foreign government or a representative of a foreign government; an alien or representative of an alien; or a corporation organized under the laws of a foreign government.125 While foreign parties may act as officers or directors of corporate licensees,126 Section 310(b)(3) prohibits foreign entities from owning or voting more than 20 percent of the capital stock of a broadcast licensee.127 Section 310(b)(4), which limits foreign ownership in parent corporations, allows us to deny a license application, upon a determination that denial is in the public interest, where more than 25 percent of the parent corporation's capital stock is owned or voted by foreign entities.128 The Commission has determined that Section 310(b) applies not only to corporate interests, but also to partnership and other non-corporate interests.129 Thus, we will apply our foreign 122 123 124  Amherst Petition at 5.

Prior to enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 310(b)(3) precluded a license from being granted to a corporation with any foreign officers or directors, and Section 310(b)(4) provided that the Commission could deny an application or revoke a license where any officer of the parent corporation is a foreign party. Citizenship Requirements Order, 11 FCC Rcd at 13073,  2. 47 U.S.C.  310(b)(3). If either the foreign ownership or voting interest in an applicant or licensee exceeds the 20 percent benchmark, we are required by law to revoke the license or refuse to grant the license application.

See Wilner and Scheiner I, 103 F.C.C. 2d at 514-15,  7, 516,  10 (stating that the Commission has applied the strictures of Section 310(b) to a variety of non-corporate entities, including unincorporated assocations and partnerships).  129  36   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  ownership rules and policies on a case-by-case basis to all entities that are LPFM applicants and licensees, guided by Commission precedent. 90. We recognize that many entities that will hold LPFM licenses will be non-stock corporations or other non-stock entities,130 and that non-stock entities do not have ""owners"" in the traditional sense. As the Commission has explained, the specific citizenship requirements of Section 310(b) reflect a deliberate judgment on the part of Congress to prevent undue foreign influence in broadcasting.131 Thus, for the purpose of determining whether a non-stock LPFM applicant or licensee complies with the statutory foreign ownership requirements, we will first consider the citizenship of those individuals who would have the ability, comparable to that of a traditional owner, to influence or control the licensee. In making these determinations we will be guided by Commission precedent. 91. An applicant or licensee must directly inform us that an ownership structure may or does in fact exceed the foreign ownership benchmarks in Section 310(b) of the Act. 6. Minority Broadcast Training Institutions  92. Minority Media and Telecommunications Council (MMTC) filed a supplementary pleading contending that the Commission should award the first LPFM licenses exclusively to minority broadcast training institutions (MBTIs). MMTC argues that such a provision is necessary to ensure that MBTIs receive licenses wherever they are available in order to assist them in their mission of educating minorities in broadcasting, to prevent discrimination, to remedy past discrimination and its consequences, and to promote diversity.132 We decline to grant MMTC's proposal. First, we do not believe it is necessary to grant MBTIs the right to receive the first wave of LPFM licenses in order to provide them a significant opportunity to participate in LPFM. Although MMTC argues that the chances of MBTIs winning many licenses are remote, it concedes that they would likely be able to earn points under our selection criteria for mutually exclusive applications.133 Thus, as long as MBTIs agree to time-share or, as a last resort, accept a shorter license term as part of a group, they will be likely to be granted a license under the tie-breaker procedures.134 93. Second, although we agree that providing minority broadcast education would be a valuable use of the LPFM service, it is not the only valuable use. We believe our current eligibility rules will lead to the ownership of LPFM stations by a wide variety of groups, which will best promote our goals in this proceeding. 130 131 132  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2224,  49. Wilner and Scheiner I, 103 F.C.C. 2d at 517,  11.  MMTC later supplemented its pleading with an ex parte letter suggesting that all educational institutions be granted an additional point in the point system for resolving mutually exclusive applications. We consider this issue below in the section on the point system 133 134  MMTC Petition at 9.  MMTC argues that time-sharing is impractical for these institutions, but we believe the value of allowing more voices on the air outweighs any procedural hurdles MBTIs must overcome to time-share.  37   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  94. Finally, notwithstanding MMTC's argument that Adarand Constructors v. Pena135 would not apply to their proposal, we believe the legal issues underlying the proposal would pose a risk of delaying the introduction of LPFM service to the public. As we stated in the Report and Order in response to requests for preferences for entities controlled by minorities, the Commission is conducting fact-finding studies as to whether such preferences may be justified consistent with Adarand.136 Depending on the outcome of these studies, as well as our experience with LPFM, we will consider in the future whether to adjust our rules to facilitate participation of more minority-oriented organizations in the service. 7. Unlicensed Broadcasters  95. In the Report and Order, we determined that unauthorized broadcasters would not be eligible for LPFM licenses unless they could certify that they (1) promptly ceased operation when directed by the Commission to do so if that direction was received prior to February 26, 1999, or (2) voluntarily ceased operation by February 26, 1999 (within 10 days of the publication of the Notice in the Federal Register.)137 In no event will an unlicensed broadcaster be eligible for an LPFM license if it continued illegally broadcasting after February 26, 1999.138 Don Schellhardt requests that we allow unlicensed broadcasters to apply for LPFM licenses if: (1) the unauthorized broadcaster challenged the legality of an FCC order to cease operations and/or sought an injunction to bar the FCC from enforcing such an Order, and (2) the court ""allowed"" the unlicensed broadcaster to continue operating while the legal challenge was pending.139 96. We reject Shellhardt's request. As discussed in the Report and Order, our rule on unlicensed broadcasters was based on our concern that past illegal broadcast operations reflect on the entity's proclivity to deal truthfully with the Commission and to comply with our rules and policies. We continue to believe that a party that continued to operate in contravention of an FCC direction to cease operations should not be eligible to apply for an LPFM license. Such a party should have ceased its illegal broadcast while pursuing any legal challenge to a Commission order.140 Any party ignoring our order has demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with the Commission's rules and thus should not be rewarded with an LPFM license. For the same reasons, we reject Schellhardt's request that those who flagrantly violated a Commission order to cease operating and ""continued to broadcast while in hiding""  135 136 137 138  515 U.S. 200 (1995).

We are not aware of any circumstances in which a court has ordered a stay of an FCC order to cease illegal broadcast operations.  38   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  or after losing a court challenge be eligible for ""probationary licenses."" F.  141  Point System For Resolving Mutually Exclusive Applications  97. In the Report and Order, the Commission created a point system to determine selection among mutually exclusive applications. The point system includes three selection criteria: (1) established community presence; (2) proposed operating hours; and (3) local program origination. The system will employ voluntary time-sharing as an initial tie-breaker; that is, tied applicants will have an opportunity to aggregate points by submitting time-share proposals. Successive license terms will be used as a final tie-breaker. 98. Kenneth Bowles seeks clarification of the local program origination point language.142 Under the point system, applicants that pledge to originate locally at least eight hours of programming per day will be assigned one point.143 In the Report and Order we defined local origination as the production of programming within 10 miles of the proposed transmitting antenna.144 Bowles argues that this point should be broadened to include programming that ""covers local persons and/or their activities and/or local issues.""145 We agree with Bowles that our definition of locally originated programming should be clarified, but we find Bowles' preferred substitute to be too broad and difficult to enforce. In the Report and Order, we explained that the local origination criteria derives from the service requirements for full-service broadcast stations, which are required to maintain the capacity to originate programming from their main studios. LPFM licensees will not be subject to main studio requirements, and will have discretion to determine the origination point of their programming. As a comparative selection factor, local program origination can advance the Commission's policy goal of addressing unmet needs for community-oriented radio broadcasting. In this regard, we believe that an applicant's intent to provide locally-originated programming is a reasonable gauge of whether the LPFM station will function as an outlet for community self-expression.146 We believe that these goals will be better served by defining local program origination as the production of programming by the licensee within 10 miles of the proposed transmitting site. The intent behind awarding a point for pledges to provide such programming is to encourage licensees to maintain production facilities and a meaningful staff presence within the community served by the station. We clarify that this rule does not necessarily preclude an applicant from claiming a point for local origination 141 142 143 144 145 146  Schelhardt Petition at 6. Bowles Petition at 3. Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2261,  144. Id. Bowles Petition at 3. Report and Order at 144.  39   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  based on coverage of a high school away game played more than ten miles away (an example Bowles provided), so long as the production involves facilities located within a 10-mile radius of the antenna. By focusing on who is producing the programming and where, the rule does not require the Commission to evaluate the content of the station's broadcasts to determine their local nature, as Bowles' proposal would. 99. Black seeks reconsideration of the voluntary time-sharing tie-breaker, alleging that the point skews LPFM allocation against stations that could provide 24-hour-per-day programming.147 We understand that an applicant will have the incentive to propose time-sharing even if it could provide fullday programming in order to maximize its points and increase the likelihood it will be selected. Although this may result in the loss of some valuable programming from a particular source, it will be replaced by programming from a different source. We believe that the benefit of bringing more voices to the radio service outweighs any disadvantages of the time-sharing approach. 100. MMTC argues that all educational institutions should be awarded an extra point in order to ensure that the first wave of LPFM licensees is ""seeded"" by stable, enduring enterprises that will promote the success and spectrum integrity of the FM service.148 We will not change the point system to award a greater preference to educational institutions. Educational institutions generally enjoy the ability to achieve the highest comparative advantage available, due to their longevity, community presence, resources, and ability to provide significant amounts of programming and locally-originated programming. They are not, however, the only institutions with such merits. In most cases educational institutions will be able to receive licenses as long as they are willing to time-share.149 Although some schools might be reluctant to time-share or have to overcome certain internal procedural hurdles to do so, as MMTC argues, the same could probably be said of many other community institutions. Operating on a less than full-time basis would not necessarily significantly diminish their ability to contribute to the community, or, in the case of MBTIs, to train a significant number of broadcast professionals. Moreover, as discussed above, the time-sharing incentives will increase access by more members of the community to the airwaves. G. Other Issues  101. Public File and Ownership Reporting. We deny a request by UCC that we impose public file and ownership reporting requirements on LPFM licensees.150 As a general matter, we agree with UCC's assertion that these are important sources of citizen information about a station's programming,  147 148  Black Petition at 1.  MMTC raises this proposal in its ""Suggestion for a Compromise Resolution of the Issues Raised in the Petition to Correct Inadvertent Omission,"" filed on May 17, 2000. Although this letter was filed after the comment deadline, we are considering it here because it raises a significant issue and no party is prejudiced by our consideration. 149  Given that most schools would be able to achieve the full three points, giving them an extra point would virtually be tantamount to giving them an absolute preference. 150  See UCC Petition.  40   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  ownership, and compliance with Commission rules.151 As we have already stated in the Report and Order, however, these requirements would impose a burden that is out of proportion to the small noncommercial nature of the stations. We also continue to believe that the community-oriented nature of the stations' service further reduces the justification for such requirements. We are not swayed by UCC's argument that nonlocal entities, which may hold LPFM licenses after the initial two years of licensing, will not have an incentive to be responsive to their communities. The unknown extent of such nonlocal ownership and the nature of resulting operations do not warrant the imposition of a disproportionate burden on all LPFM licensees at this time. 102. Low Power Advisory Committee. We will not establish a low power advisory committee as suggested by the Amherst Alliance.152 LPFM broadcasters and other interested parties are free, of course, to form a private organization to promote LPFM, support and assist its members and their operations, and address technical issues with each other and, where appropriate, raise them with the Commission. Amherst Alliance has not raised a compelling reason, however, for governmental institution of such an organization at this time. 103. Automatic Program Review. We will not establish an ""automatic program review"" as also urged by the Amherst Alliance.153 It is possible that, in time, our experience with LPFM, as with any new service, will lead us to consider changes in our rules to enhance the quality of the radio service the public receives. Amherst specifically suggests that we plan to revisit our determinations to require 2nd adjacent channel separations, to require ""buffer zones"" in our channel separations, and to reject low power AM service.154 They also suggest we consider authorizing 250 watt service in small cities and rural areas, and adjusting wattage ceilings in some urban environments.155 Although we are open to proposing, or considering proposals, to revise our rules after we have had experience with the service, we do not find it necessary to commit now to a review in the future. 104. Transfers of Control  Nonstock Entities. In the Report and Order, we established that LPFM licenses (and licensees) cannot be sold or transferred to another entity. We will here clarify, in response to Colorado Christian University's Petition for Reconsideration, that the gradual change of a governing board or membership body to the point that a majority of its members are new since the authorization was granted will not, by itself, constitute a prohibited transfer of control. This policy is consistent with the Commission's practice in responding to these gradual changes in nonstock entities when they occur for full-power NCE licensees.156  151 152 153 154 155 156  Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 2277,  185.

Regulatory Flexibility. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  601 et seq., a Supplemental Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been completed and is attached as Appendix B hereto. III. CONCLUSION  106. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, we generally affirm the decisions we reached in the Report and Order. We do, however, clarify certain rules to provide better guidance to the public, and make minor revisions to improve our procedures and the quality of the LPFM service, and to protect stations operating radio reading services, while at the same time preserving the quality of full power FM service. We also establish a process to ensure prompt resolution of certain interference problems in the unlikely event they occur. IV. PROCEDURAL MATTERS AND ORDERING CLAUSES  107.

Minimum separation requirements for LP100 and LP10 stations, as defined in Section 73.811 and Section 73.853 of this Part, are listed in the following subsections. An LPFM station will not be authorized unless these separations are met. Minimum distances for co-channel and firstadjacent channel are separated into two columns. The left-hand column lists the required minimum separation to protect other stations and the right-hand column lists (for informational purposes only) the minimum distance necessary for the LPFM station to receive no interference from other stations assumed to operating at the maximum permitted facilities for the station class. For second-adjacent channels and IF channels, the required minimum distance separation is sufficient to avoid interference received from other stations. (a)(1) An LP100 station will not be authorized initially unless the minimum distance separations in the following table are met with respect to authorized FM stations, applications for new and existing FM stations filed prior to the release of the public notice announcing an LPFM window period for LP100 stations, authorized LP100 stations, LP100 station applications that were timely-filed within a previous window, and vacant FM allotments.

(a) It shall be the responsibility of the licensee of an LPFM station to correct at its expense any condition of interference to the direct reception of the signal of any subsequently authorized commercial or NCE FM station that operates on the same channel, first-adjacent channel, second-adjacent channel or intermediate frequency (IF) channels as the LPFM station, where interference is predicted to occur and actually occurs within (1) the 3.16 mV/m (70 dBu) contour of such stations; (2) the community of license of a commercial FM station; or (3) any area of the community of license of an NCE FM station that is predicted to receive at least a 1 mV/m (60 dBu) signal. Predicted interference shall be calculated in accordance with the ratios set forth in Section 73.215(a)(1) and (2) of this Part. Intermediate Frequency (IF) channel interference overlap will be determined based upon overlap of the 91 dBu F(50,50) contours of the FM and LPFM stations. Actual interference will be considered to occur whenever reception of a regularly used signal is impaired by the signals radiated by the LPFM station. (b) An LPFM station will be provided an opportunity to demonstrate in connection with the processing of the commercial or NCE FM application that interference as described in subsection (a) is unlikely. If the LPFM station fails to so demonstrate, it will be required to cease operations upon the commencement of program tests by the commercial of NCE FM station. (c) Complaints of actual interference by an LPFM station subject to subsections (a) and (b) must be served on the LPFM licensee and the Federal Communications Commission, attention Audio Services Division. The LPFM station must suspend operations within twenty-four hours of the receipt of such complaint unless the interference has been resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant on the basis of suitable techniques. An LPFM station may only resume operations at the direction of the Federal Communications Commission. If the Commission determines that the complainant has refused to permit the LPFM station to apply remedial techniques that demonstrably will eliminate the interference without impairment of the original reception, the licensee of the LPFM station is absolved of further responsibility for the complaint. (d) (e) ***** *****  12. A new Section 73.810 is added as follows:  73.810. Third Adjacent Channel Complaint and License Modification Procedure. 52   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  (a) An LPFM station is required to provide copies of all complaints alleging that the signal of such LPFM station is interfering with or impairing the reception of the signal of a full power station to such affected full power station. (b) A full power station shall review all complaints it receives, either directly or indirectly, from listeners regarding alleged interference caused by the operations of an LPFM station. Such full power station shall also identify those that qualify as bona fide complaints under this section and promptly provide such LPFM station with copies of all bona fide complaints. A bona fide complaint: (i) is a complaint alleging third adjacent channel interference caused by an LPFM station that has its transmitter site located within the predicted 60 dBu contour of the affected full power station as such contour existed as of the date the LPFM station construction permit was granted; must be in the form of an affidavit, and state the nature and location of the alleged interference; must involve a fixed receiver located within the 60 dBu contour of the affected full power station and not more than one kilometer from the LPFM transmitter site; and must be received by either the LPFM or full power station within one year of the date on which the LPFM station commenced broadcasts with its currently authorized facilities.  (ii) (iii) (iv)  (c) An LPFM station will be given a reasonable opportunity to resolve all interference complaints. A complaint will be considered resolved where the complainant does not reasonably cooperate with an LPFM station's remedial efforts. (d) In the event that the number of unresolved complaints plus the number source of interference remains in dispute equals at least one percent of kilometer of the LPFM transmitter site or thirty households, whichever power stations must cooperate in an ""on-off"" test to determine whether to the LPFM station. of complaints for which the the households within one is less, the LPFM and full the interference is traceable  (e) If the number of unresolved and disputed complaints exceeds the numeric threshold specified in subsection (d) following an ""on-off"" test, the full power station may request that the Commission initiate a proceeding to consider whether the LPFM station license should be modified or cancelled, which will be completed by the Commission within 90 days. Parties may seek extensions of the 90 day deadline consistent with Commission rules. (f) An LPFM station may stay any procedures initiated pursuant to subsection (e) by voluntarily ceasing operations and filing an application for facility modification within twenty days of the commencement of such procedures. Section 73.816 is modified as follows:  73.816 Antennas. a) Permittees and licensees may employ nondirectional antennas with horizontal only polarization, vertical only polarization, circular polarization or elliptical polarization. 53   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  b) Directional antennas will not be authorized and may not be utilized in the LPFM service, except as provided in subsection (c) of this section. c) Public safety and transportation permittees and licensees, eligible pursuant to  73.853(a)(ii) of this part, may utilize directional antennas in connection with the operation of a Travelers' Information Service (TIS) provided each LPFM TIS station utilizes only a single antenna with standard pattern characteristics that are predetermined by the manufacturer. In no event may composite antennas (i.e. antennas that consist of multiple stacked and/or phased discrete transmitting antennas) and/or transmitters be employed. d) LPFM TIS stations will be authorized as nondirectional stations. The use of a directional antenna as provided for in subsection (c) will not be considered in the determination of compliance with any requirements of this part. Section 73.825 is modified as follows: 73.825 Protection to Reception of TV Channel 6 (a) LPFM stations will be authorized on Channels 201 through 220 only if the pertinent minimum separation distances in the following table are met with respect to all full power TV Channel 6 stations.

(b) Complaints of actual interference by an LPFM station subject to subsection (a) must be served on the LPFM licensee and the Federal Communications Commission, attention Audio Services Division. The LPFM station must suspend operations upon the receipt of such complaint unless the interference has been resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant on the basis of suitable techniques. Short test transmissions may be made during the period of suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures. An LPFM station may only resume full operation at the direction of the Federal Communications Commission. If the Commission determines that the complainant has refused to permit the LPFM station to apply remedial techniques that demonstrably will eliminate the interference without impairment of the original reception, the licensee of the LPFM station is absolved of further responsibility for the complaint. Section 73.854 is modified as follows:  73.854 Unlicensed operations. No application for an LPFM station may be granted unless the applicant certifies, under penalty of perjury, to one of the following statements: (a) Neither the applicant, nor any party to the application, has engaged in any manner including individually or with persons, groups, organizations or other entities, in the unlicensed operation of any station in violation of Section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 301. (b) To the extent the applicant or any party to the application has engaged in any manner, individually or with other persons, groups, organizations or other entities, in the unlicensed operation of a station in violation of Section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Section 301, such an engagement: (1) ceased voluntarily no later than February 26, 1999, if not previously directed by the FCC to cease operation; or (2) ceased operation within 24 hours of being directed by the FCC to terminate unlicensed operation of any station but in no event later than February 26, 1999. Section 73.855 is modified as follows:  73.855 Ownership Limits 57   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  *** (b) Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, nationwide ownership limits will be phased in according to the following schedule: (4) Not-for-profit organizations and governmental entities with a public safety purpose may be granted multiple licenses only if: (i) (ii) one of the multiple applications is submitted as a priority application, and; the remaining non-priority applications do not face a mutually exclusive challenge.  Section 73.860 is modified as follows:  73.860 Cross Ownership *** (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this subsection, no license for an LPFM station shall be granted to any party if the grant of such authorization will result in the same party holding an attributable interest in any other non-LPFM broadcast station, including any FM translator or low power television station, or any other media subject to our broadcast ownership restrictions. (b) A party with an attributable interest in a broadcast radio station must divest such interest prior to the commencement of operations of an LPFM station in which the party also holds an interest unless such party is a college or university that can certify that the existing broadcast radio station is not student run. This exception applies only to parties that; (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) are accredited educational institutions, and; own attributable interest in non-student run broadcast stations; apply for an authorization for an LPFM station that will be managed and operated on a day-to-day basis by students of the accredited educational institution; and do not face competing applications for the LPFM authorization.  Section 73.870 is modified as follows:  73.870 Processing of LPFM Broadcast Station applications. 58   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  ***** (c) Applications separations with Public Notice in filed in the same ****  subject to subsection (b) that fail to meet the Section 73.807 minimum distance respect to all applications and facilities in existence as the date of the pertinent subsection (b), other than to LPFM station facilities proposed in applications window, will be dismissed without any opportunity to amend such applications.  Section 73.872 is modified as follows:  73.872 Selection procedure for mutually exclusive application. *** (3) Local program origination. The applicant must pledge to originate locally at least eight hours of programming per day. For purposes of this criterion, local origination is the production of programming, by the licensee, within ten miles of the coordinates of the proposed transmitting antenna. Section 73.877 is modified as follows:  73.877 Station Logs for LPFM stations. The (a) is removed at the outset of that paragraph, although the content of ""(a)"" remains, and the numbers are changed to letters. Section 73.1660 is modified as follows: 73.1660 Acceptability of broadcast transmitters. (a)(1) An AM, FM, or TV transmitter shall be verified for compliance with the requirements of this part following the procedures described in Part 2 of the FCC rules. (a)(2) An LPFM transmitter shall be certified for compliance with the requirements of this part following the procedures described in Part 2 of the FCC rules.

No comments were received in response to the IRFA and the one comment received in response to the FRFA is addressed below. This present Supplemental Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (Supplemental FRFA) conforms to the RFA.159 Need for, and Objectives of, the Memorandum Opinion and Order In the Report and Order, the Commission adopted a 100-watt class (LP100) and a 10-watt class (LP10) of small radio stations. Because of the predicted lower construction and operational costs of LPFM stations as opposed to full power facilities, the Commission expects that small entities would be expected to have few economic obstacles to becoming LPFM licensees. Therefore, as discussed in the Report and Order and the FRFA, this new service may serve as a vehicle for small entities and under-represented groups (including women and minorities) to gain valuable broadcast experience and to add their voices to their local communities. The Commission received petitions for reconsideration of the Report and Order that requested reconsideration of a variety of issues. This Memorandum Opinion and Order resolves those issues. We do not change most of the determinations made in the Report and Order. We do, however, adopt the following few changes. We adopt complaint and license modification procedures to ensure that if any unexpected, significant 3rd adjacent channel interference problems are caused by the operation of a particular LPFM station, it can be resolved expeditiously. We modify the spacing standards adopted in the Report and Order to require that LPFM stations operating on 3rd adjacent channels protect stations operating radio reading services and we increase the flexibility of the ownership rules for certain specific types of applicants.  Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the FRFA J. Rodger Skinner (Skinner), who submitted one of the original Petitions for Rulemaking regarding  157  See 5 U.S.C.  603. The RFA, see 5 U.S.C.  601 et seq., has been amended by the Contract With America Advancement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-121, 110 Stat. 847 (1996) (CWAAA). Title II of the CWAAA is the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA). 158  Creation of a Low Power Radio Service, MM Docket No. 99-25, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 14 FCC Rcd 2471, 2530-2534 (1999) (Notice); Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 2205, Appendix C (2000). See 5 U.S.C.  604.  159  61   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  LPFM on February 5, 1998, contends in his Comments that the Report and Order's FRFA analysis was flawed in claiming that the institution of LPFM service would ""create significant opportunities for new small businesses.""160 Skinner argues that the rejection of commercial service, the imposition of 3rd adjacent channel separations and the refusal to include 1000 watt stations undercut the Commission's expectation of new stations in the LPFM service. His argument, however, that the alternative resolutions he proposes were not considered and their rejection explained is mistaken. Both the Report and Order and the Memorandum Opinion and Order address each issue that he raises. In instituting this new LPFM service and in determining the rules that will govern it, we were concerned with the impact of our rules on small businesses, and took many steps to ensure the availability of this service to new entities. For instance, we adopted strict ownership limitations, made electronic filing voluntary, and refrained from main studio requirements for LPFM stations.161 At the same time, we explicitly weighed the best manner in which to achieve our goals in protecting existing service and creating this service against the benefits of commercial service, less stringent interference protection and higher power limits. Skinner's argument that small local businesses will be deprived of a potential economical advertising outlet also is insufficient to outweigh the reasons for our determination to make LPFM a strictly noncommercial service.  Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which Rules Will Apply The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that will be affected by the rules.162 The RFA generally defines the term ""small entity"" as having the same meaning as the terms ""small business,"" ""small organization,"" and ""small governmental jurisdiction.""163 In addition, the term ""small business"" has the same meaning as the term ""small business concern"" under the Small Business Act.164 A small business concern is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).165 A small organization is generally ""any notfor-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.""166  160 161 162 163 164  Skinner Petition at 3. See Report and Order Appendix C. 5 U.S.C.  603(b)(3). 5 U.S.C.  601(6).  5 U.S.C.  601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of ""small business concern"" in 15 U.S.C.  632). Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies ""unless an agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register."" 5 U.S.C.  601(3). 165 166  Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.  632 (1996). 5 U.S.C.  601(4).  62   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  Nationwide, as of 1992, there were approximately 275,801 small organizations.167 ""Small governmental jurisdiction"" generally means ""governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than 50,000.""168 The Census Bureau estimates that this ratio is approximately accurate for all governmental entities. Thus, of the 85,006 governmental entities, we estimate that 81,600 (91 per cent) are small entities. The SBA defines a radio broadcasting station that has $5 million or less in annual receipts as a small business.169 A radio broadcasting station is an establishment primarily engaged in broadcasting aural programs by radio to the public.170 Included in this industry are commercial, religious, educational, and other radio stations.171 The 1992 Census indicates that 96 percent (5,861 of 6,127) radio station establishments produced less than $5 million in revenue in 1992.172 Official Commission records indicate that 11,334 individual radio stations were operating in 1992.173 As of September 30, 1999, Commission records indicate that 12,615 radio stations were operating, of which 7,832 were FM stations.174 The rules will apply to a new category of FM radio broadcasting service. It is not known how many entities may seek to obtain a low power radio license. Nor do we know how many of these entities will be small entities. We note, however, that in the eighteen months since we issued the Notice, the Commission's LPFM website has received approximately 100,000 hits, demonstrating the interest of individuals and groups in operating such a facility. In addition, we expect that, due to the small size of low power FM stations, small entities would generally have a greater interest than large ones in acquiring them.

Id. The definition used by the SBA also includes radio broadcasting stations which also produce radio program materials. Separate establishments that are primarily engaged in producing radio program material are classified under another SIC number, however. Id. 172  The Census Bureau counts radio stations located in the same facility as one establishment. Therefore, each co-located AM/FM combinations counts as one establishment. 173 174  FCC News Release, No. 31327 (Jan. 13, 1993). FCC News Release, ""Broadcast Station Totals as of September 30, 1999"" (Nov. 22, 1999).  63   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  Most of the provisions of the Report and Order are unchanged by the Memorandum Opinion and Order. As noted in the Report and Order, the new service will require the collection of information for the purposes of processing applications for (among other things) initial construction permits, assignments and transfers, and renewals. We will also require lower power radio stations to comply with some of the reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of full power radio broadcasters. The portions of the Report and Order that were altered by the Memorandum Opinion and Order follow: (1) radio reading services will be protected on the 3rd adjacent channel, (2) corrections were made to the spacing table, (3) a complaint procedure was added, (4) transportation entities will be permitted to hold multiple stations in certain instances, and (5) an ownership exception was created for university-licensees of low power radio stations. We do not anticipate that these changes will result in any changes to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of LPFM licensees. Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant Alternatives Considered The RFA requires agencies to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives: (1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.175 The Commission believes that the LPFM service is likely to create significant opportunities for new small businesses. None of the changes made by the Memorandum Opinion and Order alter that belief. This Memorandum Opinion and Order alters the LPFM rules by allowing an expedited complaint process, creating additional interference protection for radio reading services, and increasing flexibility for specific licensees (university and public safety entities). The Commission believes that none of these revisions will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. However, in an abundance of caution we will examine any potential impact to potential LPFM licensees. The Commission does not anticipate that LPFM service will cause interference to existing stations. Due to concern expressed by parties about potential interference, however, the Commission has adopted complaint and license modification procedures to ensure that if any unexpected, significant 3rd adjacent channel interference problems are caused by the operation of a particular LPFM station, they can be resolved expeditiously. We believe this process will assist small entities by providing resolution to problems without delays and the potential for incurring legal and consulting expenses. The Commission offered additional protection to the radio reading services, pending its analysis of a Commission study conducted to assess radio reading service's performance as compared with other receivers. While awaiting the results of the study, the Commission will not license LPFM stations on 3rd adjacent channels to existing stations with radio reading services. Because radio reading services provide such a valuable service, we have modified the rules to assure that interference to radio reading services does not occur. The only other alternative considered would have been to leave the rules as originally 175  5 U.S.C.  603(c)(1)-(4).  64   Federal Communications Commission  FCC 00-349  drafted in the Report and Order. We decided against that alternative until such a time as the Commission can confirm that no unacceptable interference would occur. The Commission makes a few other changes to the Report and Order. We allow transportation and public safety entities to hold multiple LPFM stations in certain instances and create an ownership exception for university-licensees of low power radio stations. Petitioners showed the Commission that these exceptions were merited based on the specific circumstances of these potential licensees. The only other alternative was to leave the rules as adopted in the Report and Order; to do so would not have accounted for the beneficial service, and unique circumstances, of particular applicants. Report to Congress The Commission will send a copy of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, including this Supplemental FRFA, in a report to be sent to Congress pursuant to the SBREFA.176 In addition, the Commission will send a copy of the Memorandum Opinion and Order, including the Supplemental FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA. A copy of the Memorandum Opinion and Order and Supplemental FRFA (or summaries thereof) will also be published in the Federal Register.177  176 177  5 U.S.C.  801(a)(1)(A).

KENNARD Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, In the Matter of Creation of Low Power Radio Service (MM Docket No. 99-25)  I am very pleased that we have taken the next step in creating room on the dial for real community radio of, for, and by the people. By the end of the year, I am confident that Low Power FM Radio service will provide wonderful opportunities for schools, churches, and other local organizations to use the public airwaves to make their voices heard. We have already received close to 1200 LPFM radio applications from the first 20 states to file. I have always been confident that LPFM can be implemented without disturbing the integrity of the existing FM service. In order to address the concerns raised by the operators of radio reading services that serve millions of blind and low vision listeners, the Commission changed the LPFM licensing scheme to refrain from licensing LPFM stations on frequencies third adjacent to radio reading services. In response to the concerns of existing FM broadcasters, including National Public Radio, the Commission has established an enforcement procedure that will allow for the expedited resolution of any unexpected significant interference. Finally, we modified the rules to make certain student groups eligible for LPFM stations and to better serve the needs of public safety and transportation authorities. These changes strengthen the LPFM service. Each of these radio services are important to America, and I believe that these services can co-exist and flourish to the benefit of American communities.   September 22, 2000  Separate Statement of Commissioner Susan Ness Re: Creation of Low Power Radio Service, MM Docket No. 99-25 In its request for reconsideration of our Report and Order, National Public Radio, Inc. (""NPR"") raised concerns regarding the possibility of interference by new low power FM stations to existing FM broadcast operations and to reading services offered by many NPR stations for the blind. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration (""MO&O""), the Commission has taken significant steps to accommodate those concerns. I therefore support the Commission's action on reconsideration with the expectation that the valuable services provided by NPR and other FM stations will not receive unacceptable interference from new low power (""LPFM"") stations. In the MO&O, the Commission takes several steps to reduce or eliminate problems associated with potential interference from new LPFM facilities. First, the Commission establishes a new streamlined ""rocket docket"" procedure for addressing LPFM station interference complaints. Under the new procedure, all LPFM stations should make diligent efforts to resolve each and every complaint that they receive. The new rule also provides for a complaint and license modification procedure that the Commission must complete within ninety days if a requisite number of complaints are received. Second, the Commission has committed to protect the third adjacent channel of stations currently offering reading services for the blind. It is my understanding that the Commission will not authorize any LPFM station that does not protect any full-service FM station on a third adjacent channel that operates a radio reading service. Finally, NPR has noted that some stations operate a series of interlocking translator stations to cover remote areas of their states. These translator relay systems provide a vital public service by covering rural and remote areas where service from a full-service FM station is not feasible. If there is interference to one of the translators in the chain, it could prevent service from subsequent stations in the chain. In the MO&O, the Commission requires protection of the translator input frequencies of these stations from interference from LPFM stations. Moreover, the Commission has committed to increasing the flexibility that will be accorded displaced translator licensees so that a translator that is forced to move because of interference from a new full power station will receive every administrative effort to accommodate the translator on a new frequency. In the MO&O, the Commission has made these efforts, all of which are reasonable modifications to its original Report and Order, in the attempt to ensure that current service to the public is not harmed by the introduction of new LPFM stations. While these precautions and procedures are not foolproof, they constitute significant safeguards that the promise of a new innovative service from LPFM stations will not deprive the public of the benefits of current FM public radio services.   In the Matter of Creation of Low Power Radio Service, MM Docket No. 99-25, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth For the reasons given in my dissent from the original Report and Order on low power radio,1 I dissent from this Order on Reconsideration. This Order reaffirms the Commission's threshold decision to create the service and remove existing adjacent channel protections, and I disagree strongly with that course of action. In addition, I note that the Commission continues to forge relentlessly ahead on this issue, notwithstanding the expression of substantial Congressional disapproval of its approach to the creation of this service and the serious interference questions for existing broadcasters and their listeners that remain unresolved to this day. A higher regard for Congress, and for those broadcasters who today serve their communities ably and well, would counsel a more serious reconsideration of this issue than that performed today.  See Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, In the Matter of Low Power Radio Service, Report & Order, MM Docket No. 99-25, 15 FCC Rcd. 2205 (2000). 1   September 22, 2000 SEPARATE STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER MICHAEL K. POWELL CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART Re: Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, In the Matter of Creation of Low Power Radio Service (MM Docket No. 99-25)  As I expressed in my separate statement to the original Report and Order,1 the Item's goal of attempting to give greater voice to narrower interests is generally laudable, and I support that objective. I did, however, also express serious concerns about the potential threat to small stations caused by this new LPFM service. Specifically, I addressed two interrelated issues: 1) signal interference and 2) economic viability. I concur in today's decision to the extent improvements have been made to address some of the unresolved technical issues. The third channel adjacency complaint procedure will give stations with bona fide interference complaints, the opportunity to have those problems resolved. Furthermore, the expedited review process will ensure that an interference problem does not linger for prolonged periods of time. These changes are a step in the right direction to minimizing the risks caused by signal interference. I dissent in part from this Order, because the Commission once again fails to consider the economic consequences to small broadcast stations resulting from the introduction of LPFM.  1  See Statement of Commissioner Michael K. Powell, dissenting in part, In the Matter of Low Power Radio Service, Report and Order, MM Docket No. 99-25, FCC 00-19, 15 FCC Rcd 2205, 2323 (2000)."

Established by the Communications Act of l934, it is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Its jurisdiction covers the 50 states and territories, the District of Columbia and U.S. possessions. The FCC is directed by five Commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered five-year terms. No more than three can be members of the same political party. The President designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairman. The Commissioners hold regular agenda meetings and special meetings. They also may act between meetings by ""circulation,"" a procedure whereby a document is submitted to each Commissioner individually for official action. The Chairman presides over all FCC meetings. The Chairman coordinates and organizes the work of the Commission and represents the agency in legislative matters and in relations with other government departments and agencies. The Commission reorganized itself in FY95 to establish two new bureaus -- Wireless Telecommunications and International -- to reflect the changes in the industries it regulates. It also continued its use of emerging technologies to serve more efficiently its customers -- the American public and regulated industries. The FCC expanded its use of the Internet, which has become an increasingly popular way for the public to access information. In FY95 the FCC established a ""home page"" and expanded its Internet communications pipeline to meet increased use by the public and staff. The Commission implemented a fax-on-demand system to allow quick access to forms, press releases and other information. In addition, the FCC installed six video teleconferencing systems in its various offices in Washington, DC, and Gettysburg, PA. The FCC completed the installation of ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) telephones for Headquarters staff in FY95. In addition, the Headquarters voice mail system was enhanced to allow greater capacity and flexibility.   COMMISSION  11  Information technology continues to be a significant factor in the success of the Commission's auction activities. Technology is used for remote bid submission plus electronic calculation and notification of round results.  Bureaus and Offices The Commission is composed of six operating bureaus and 10 offices which provide support services. Office of the Managing Director (OMD)  Under the supervision and direction of the Chairman, the Managing Director serves as the FCC's chief operating and executive official. The Managing Director provides managerial leadership to, and exercises supervision and direction over, the FCC's bureaus and staff offices in management and administrative matters; formulates and administers all management and administrative policy programs and directives for the Commission; assists the Chairman in carrying out administrative responsibilities; advises the Chairman, Commissioners and management on administrative and related matters; administers the FCC's management systems and directs agency efforts in improving management effectiveness, operational efficiency and employee productivity. Office of Public Affairs (OPA)  The Office of Public Affairs is responsible for informing the press and public of the FCC's actions, facilitating public participation in the FCC's decision-making processes, operating many of the FCC's public reference rooms and library and conducting an extensive consumer outreach program. OPA issues daily news releases, public notices and other informational material; prepares the Annual Report and other publications; handles telephone, written, and walk-in requests for information. OPA maintains the FCC's Internet web site. Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  The Office of the Inspector General was created by the Inspector General Amendments Act of l988. The Inspector General conducts and supervises audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the agency. The Inspector General recommends policies for activities designed to promote economy, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in agency programs. The Inspector General also provides a means for keeping the Chairman, Commissioners and the Congress fully informed about problems and deficiencies at the agency. Office of Hearings and Review (OHR)  Administrative Law Judges preside over hearings and issue Initial Decisions. Review of Initial Decisions is done by the full Commission.   12  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT  Office of the General Counsel (OGC)  The General Counsel serves as the chief legal advisor to the Commission and its various bureaus and offices. The General Counsel also represents the Commission before the federal courts of appeals, recommends decisions in adjudicatory matters before the Commission, assists the Commission in its decisionmaking capacity, performs a variety of legal functions regarding internal administrative matters and advises the Commission on fostering competition and promoting deregulation in a competitive environment. Office of Workplace Diversity (OWD)  The Office of Workplace Diversity, established this year, serves as the principal advisor to the Chairman and Commission on all aspects of workforce diversity, affirmative recruitment, equal employment opportunity and civil rights within the Commission. The office develops, coordinates, evaluates, and recommends to the Commission internal policies, practices, and programs designed to foster a diverse workforce and to promote equal opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment. Office of Communication Business Opportunities (OCBO)  Also new this year, the Office of Communications Business Opportunities is responsible for providing advice to the Commission on issues and policies concerning opportunities for ownership and contracting by small, minority and women-owned communications businesses. The office also advises the Commission on policies to foster equal employment opportunity in the communications industries for minorities, women, and people with disabilities. The office works with entrepreneurs, industry and public interest organizations and individuals to provide information about policies to promote ownership and employment opportunities in the communications industry. Office of Plans and Policy (OPP)  The Office of Plans and Policy serves as principal economic and technical policy adviser to the Commission, analyzing agenda items and developing long-term policy. The office also produces working papers on major policy issues. (A more extensive profile of the office is included later in this report.) Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (OLIA)  The Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs serves as the Commission's principle point of contact with Congress and other governmental entities. Its name was changed this fiscal year from the Office of Legislative Affairs to reflect its expanded responsibilities. (A more extensive profile of the office is included later in this report.)   COMMISSION 13  Office of Engineering and Technology (OET)  The Office of Engineering and Technology is responsible for managing the non-Government use of the spectrum. OET makes recommendations to the Commission on how the radio spectrum should be allocated and establishes the technical standards to be followed by users. OET provides technical leadership to create new opportunities for competitive technologies and services for the American public. (A more extensive profile of the office is included later in this report.) The Operating Bureaus  The Commission is divided into six operating bureaus reflecting six broad divisions of Commission responsibility. These are: the Mass Media, Common Carrier, Wireless Telecommunications, Compliance and Information, International, and Cable Services Bureaus.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, far right, listens to President Clinton talk about reinventing government.   14  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT  FCC Appropriations History  1970-79 1970 ------ $24,561,000 1971 ------ $26,844,000 1972 ------ $31,969,000 1973 ------ $34,173,000 1974 ------ .$40,155,000 1975 ------ $46,900,000 1976 ------ $51,163,000 1977 ------ $56,911,000 1978 ------ $64,550,000 1979 ------ $70,466,000  1980-89 1980 ------ $76,047,000 1981 ------ $80,363,000 1982 ------ $79,900,000 1983 ------ $82,917,000 1984 ------ $88,283,000 1985 ------ $95,441,000 1986 ------ $90,341,000 1987 ------ $97,099,000 1988 ------ $99,613,000 1989 ------ $99,613,000  1990-95 1990 ....... $107,550,000 1991 ....... 116,794,0001/ 1992 ....... $126,309,000 1993 ....... $140,000,0002/ 1994 ....... $160,300,000 1995 ....... $185,232,000 3/  1/ Final action of Graham- Rudman - Hollings Sequestration Act on total appropriation Level of $116,794,000 reduced available funds by $1,518 to $116,792,482. 2/ Appropriation included $11,500,000 in supplemental no-year funding to implement the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. 3/ Reduced by $305,000 for administration and contract costs savings to $184,927,000.

The FCC Disabilities Issues Task Force was formed in March of 1995 by Chairman Reed Hundt, the FCC Disabilities Issues Commissioner. Linda Dubroof, Deputy Chief of the Network Services Division, Common Carrier Bureau, was appointed Director of the Task Force in June 1995 by Chairman Hundt. Every Bureau and Office of the FCC is represented on the Task Force. The Task Force serves as the FCC's main point of contact and coordination on all disability access initiatives, and works to ensure that the FCC takes steps to promote access to the Information Superhighway by individuals with disabilities.  Accomplishments  In June 1995 Chairman Hundt announced a ""Top Ten List"" of things that the FCC could do to facilitate access for persons with disabilities. Working Groups were formed to implement this Top Ten List. In July 1995, to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) for persons with hearing and speech disabilities, Miss America 1995 Heather Whitestone visited the FCC and participated in a live TRS call with Chairman Hundt. The TRS working group began discussion of a future Notice of Inquiry (NOI) addressing how TRS can serve more Americans in more efficient ways. The Commission implemented a policy ensuring that all Commission open meetings are closed-captioned for people with hearing disabilities; Task Force members began work on an accessibility handbook and a training video for FCC employees on disability issues. In April 1995 the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), WT No. 95-56, to create a new Low Power Radio Service that would include auditory assistive listening devices for individuals with hearing disabilities.   D  ISABILITIES  TASKFORCE 17   Task Force members and other FCC officials met with cable industry representatives and representatives of the disability community to negotiate a plan for ensuring that the Emergency Alert System (EAS) will be accessible to persons with disabilities.  The Task Force began work on an FCC policy paper regarding the universal design of telecommunications equipment and services; participated in industry and consumer fora on universal design and other accessibility issues.  Representatives of the Task Force and the Mass Media Bureau began circulating drafts of a historic Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on closedcaptioning and video description of video programming, for Commission adoption and release in December 1995.  Task Force members and Common Carrier Bureau staff conducted a Negotiated Rulemaking between industry and consumers on wireline telephone hearing aid- compatibility, over rules which were suspended in April 1993; also prepared a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), for release in November 1995 to implement the recommendations of the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee.  Chairman Hundt and the Task Force began dialogue with industry and consumer groups on the issue of hearing aid-compatibility with wireless digital (PCS) telephones, with plans for a January 1996 Summit between industry and consumers on wireless compatibility.  Chairman Hundt and Heather Whitestone, Miss America 1995, demonstrate use of the Telcommunications Relay Services, which allows hearing - or speech-impaired people to have access to all telephone services.   18 F  EDERAL  COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT  FCC On Line  FY95 is the year the FCC went ""on line."" Until this year the Internet program was very limited, and had virtually no visual presence. Transactions were almost all based on file transfer protocol. Chairman Hundt committed the FCC to using Internet's World Wide Web as a mechanism for disseminating information about Commission proceedings and documents. The Office of Public Affairs was given the responsibility of organizing and managing the FCC's Internet activities, with technical support from the Office of the Managing Director. At the same time, all Bureaus and Offices were requested to participate in and contribute to the development of Internet. It was during this time that the FCC completed the evolution of its computing infrastructure from an archaic centralized mainframe computing environment with little or no communications capability into a modern distributed computer infrastructure . The project became known at the FCC as the Information Systems Modernization project. ISM began in 1989 with the official decision to ""replace the Honeywell"" and was completed in 1995 when Chairman Hundt unplugged the old mainframe. The project included development of a highly reliable local area network, placement of a personal computer on every employee's desk, and migration of virtually every license processing application in the Commission to a new computing platform. Internet is one of the most radically different of all the new applications which needed that modern infrastructure to exist. During FY95 the Office of Public Affairs began operating as a production center with a goal of publishing all FCC documents on the Internet concurrently with paper release. To achieve this goal, OPA created a file structure to accommodate all types of FCC documents and drafted an entire suite of Internet Pages to serve as the basis for Bureaus and Offices to use in devising their own pages. At the same time, computer support staff set up automated scripts (programs) to create indexes to assist users in finding the documents they needed to see. The use of intelligent file names (i.e., names which reflect information about the file) plus the indexes constituted the most reliable means to locate documents on the FCC site. All over the FCC, authors now send their documents to a special mailbox. At the same time that those documents are released in paper copy. From this mailbox, OPA staff format and post the documents to the Internet, providing unprecedented access to FCC customers across the country and throughout the world. During the year more than 5,000 documents were published on the `Net, many within one day of release. The page also invited questions, comments or suggestions to be directed to a new email box: FCCINFO@fcc.gov. Public usage of the system quickly rose to 14,000 ""hits"" per day on the original Internet server. This number includes Auctions activities featuring Round Results, which are loaded onto the Net within 1/2 to 3/4 hour of close of bidding. The initial surge of usage stabilized at about 16,000 hits per day. Hundreds of email queries per month are received in the various email boxes publicized on Internet, ranging from comments on the site itself, to questions of how to obtain information or services from the FCC, to thoughtfully composed discussions of various policy issues.   FCC ON-LINE  19  Usage statistics show that the most frequently ""hit"" files are the Main FCC Home Page, http://www.fcc.gov; auctions information; Chairman's and Commissoners' Pages; and special interest pages. Databases, especially where individual queries are available, are also highly visited. Finally, a large number of individual files are hit once or twice. During this start-up phase the FCC also began a Listserver Daily Digest subscription service. The Digest is a summary of Commission activities reflected in its published documents. It includes bibiliographic information and summaries of public notices, news releases, and documents scheduled for publication in the FCC Record. There are now approximately 1,000 subscribers on the DD listserver. Comments and requests to add new information or to expand existing services began flowing in from around the world via email, phone and letter. The FCC has received numerous comments on the wealth of information now being transmitted via Internet. At the same time, customers are requesting more complete document coverage concurrent with notification, better explanations of what's on the `Net, additional information about applications status, better access to Commission staff, electronic forms and electronic filing are what the public wants on the Internet. Requests for more and more information increase with each new addition to the site, and at the same time usage of the site increases. During FY95 Chairman Hundt initiated ""the Chairman's Corner"" a bi-weekly column in which he discusses public policy issues and invites responses to his comments. Commissioners Quello, Ness and Chong also have set up their own pages, complete with speeches, columns and biographical information. The Chairman and Commissioners each have a reply form which enables readers to respond directly to the issues or topics discussed in the column. This feature brings the Commssion within reach of ""regular citizens"" who highly appreciated it, judging by favorable comments received via email, whether or not the commenter agrees with the underlying policy positions. Additionally, Chairman Hundt and Commissioner Chong have participated in online ""chats"" via America Online and Compuserve.  Chairman Hundt officially decommissions the FCC's old Honeywell computer on May 19,1995, ushering in a new era in FCC computing.   20 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  21  Mass Media Bureau  The Mass Media Bureau IS the part of the FCC that deals with broadcasting - television and radio -- as well as Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) (sometimes called wireless cable) and Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), a service used mainly by educational entities to provide classroom instruction struction to multiple locations. The Bureau issues licenses (authorization of service), performs policy and rulemaking functions and administers the enforcement program for all mass media services.  Overview  The AUDIO SERVICES DIVISION (ASD), the largest Division in the Bureau, licenses commercial and noncommercial educational AM, FM and FM translator services. In FY95 ASD planned and implemented a major reorganization aimed at streamlining its operations, reducing levels of review, and improving its speed of service. The reorganization eliminated all three branches, reduced the number of supervisors by seven, and established work groups focused on a particular type of work rather than a broadcast service. Through the reorganization, the Division divided its legal staff so that senior staff and reviewers concentrated on the contested cases and appeals, and the less senior staff on the more routine applications. The reorganization also allowed the managers to implement a more focused case-by-case tracking system. ASD designed a new computerized application processing and tracking system for processing the more than 12,000 radio renewal applications that will be filed during the current license renewal cycle. Additionally, ASD created a radio renewal booklet to facilitate the renewal process for licensees by consolidating all forms, information, helpful tips and worksheets in a convenient packet. ASD also took a number of steps to improve the availability of information to its customers. It established a Customer Service Team to upgrade the quality and efficiency of the Division's public information dissemination by providing the public with information about processing procedures, application status, and expected processing times. The AM and FM engineering databases are now available to the public from commercial sources or, in compressed form, through the Internet. A toll-free Radio Renewal Information telephone line and a radio renewal email Internet address have also been established to assist licensees in the license renewal process.   22 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  The VIDEO SERVICES DIVISION (VSD) licenses commercial and noncommercial educational TV, Low Power TV, TV translators, MDS and ITFS. To prompt the development of the Multipoint and/or Multichannel Distribution Service (MDS) as a viable competitor to cable television service, the Commission in June 1994 refocused and prioritized the MDS application process, transferring that function to the Mass Media Bureau. In accordance with the principles of the National Performance Review, VSD formulated a new organizational structure that featured multidisciplinary, collaborative work teams under the immediate guidance of a sole management-level official within that Division. During FY95 the reorganized MDS staff was able to make significant progress towards eliminating the large backlog of MDS applications and legal cases that were pending at the time that the MDS service was transferred to the Bureau. At the same time, several rulemaking initiatives were developed by Video Services Division in order to develop more effective procedures to promote the initiation of new and improved ITFS and MDS services. The POLICY AND RULES DIVISION ( PRD) conducts rulemaking proceedings which affect the mass media services and provides legal and technical analyses of these rules. The Policy and Rules Division also conducts sociological and economic studies to formulate and evaluate Commission policies in terms of their economic effects on the media or on other Commission-regulated industries or society. During FY95 the Allocations Branch of the Policy and Rules Division streamlined its internal process for adopting most rulemaking decisions. It has reduced the review process by eliminating one intermediate level of review. It has also significantly increased its reliance on procedural rules in disposing of petitions for reconsideration and applications for review by issuing summary dispositions of issues that are repetitious of earlier pleadings and that have been addressed in earlier decisions. These changes, along with a temporary shift in resources, permitted the Branch to reduce its backlog of cases over one-year-old by over 50% during the summer of 1995. The ENFORCEMENT DIVISION (ED) responds to complaints, conducts investigations concerning broadcast stations, handles matters concerning political broadcasting regulations, enforces the broadcast and cable television equal employment opportunity laws and rules, and participates in formal adjudicative proceedings involving broadcast stations. During FY95 the Enforcement Division streamlined its organization and improved speed of service without sacrificing quality by developing substitutes for a former level of managerial review. Specifically, it eliminated two management positions through attrition. It encouraged peer review to reduce further the amount of managerial review necessary. The Division also established task forces, frequently across Branch lines, to focus the Division's efforts on its highest priorities. These task forces were led by nonmanagerial team leaders, chosen for their expertise in the task at hand. The   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  23  flattened structure and the task forces have increased efficiency, team spirit and morale while reducing levels of review. In FY95 the Bureau adopted the practice of streamlining its decision documents by eliminating long detailed recitation of background and non-decisional facts. The underlying legal analysis is not reduced, but the letter decisions more succinctly present the basis for the decision. This new practice significantly reduced the amount of review and editing time.  Eliminated Prime Time Access Rule.  Developed and successfully carried out a plan to eliminate by June 1995 the existing backlog of radio and television assignment and transfer applications that were contested and/or involved rule waivers and that had been pending for over 180 days, except for those cases that were blocked by circumstances beyond the Bureau's control. In all, 93 contested sales applications were disposed by staff action and recommendations to the Commission for disposition were made with respect to 10 other sales applications. At the same time, the Bureau met its concurrent commitment to maintain the current speed of service for routine radio and television sales applications at 60 days.  Reduced substantially the backlog of MDS applications and legal cases pending at the assumption of the MDS authorization of service function. By the close of FY95 the reorganized MDS staff reduced that number to 4,065, a 72% reduction. This included a 96% reduction (from 5,523 to 207) in the number of petitions to deny that were pending at the time of the transfer.  Conducted 109 lotteries involving 420 mutually exclusive LPTV and TV translator applications, of which nearly 12% were filed by entities that were more than 50% minority owned. In 14 of 49 lotteries (26%) a minority applicant was the winner.  Increased by more than 32% (from 468 to 628) the number of ITFS new and major change application disposals with nearly 88% of those disposals being non-routine actions.  Significantly improved the speed of service for FM license applications by streamlining the authorization process, reducing the average processing time from 10 months to 90 days.  FY95 Highlights   24 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   R esponded to 18,031 telephone and 7,594 written complaints and inquiries made in connection with the Bureau's enforcement program. Also, issued 16 Notices of Apparent Liability totaling $183,000 and six forfeiture orders totaling $51,500.  Major Proceedings Multipoint Distribution Service (MM Docket No. 94-131 and PP Docket No. 93-253)  In December 1994 the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) seeking comments on proposals to streamline the procedures by which applications for new facilities in the single channel and multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services (MDS) are filed and processed. The Commission proposed to adopt filing procedures consistent with its competitive bidding procedure, requiring applicants to file only short-form applications for predetermined geographic areas with the successful bidders filing long-form applications at a later date. Comments on alternative filing procedures, including a national filing window and one limited to existing licensees and systems operations, were also solicited. In the Notice, the Commission also invited comment on the technical and practical feasibility of utilizing a mandatory electronic filing approach in conjunction with the proposed filing procedures. The Commission's announced goal in instituting this proceeding was to facilitate development of wireless cable, the delivery of video programming via microwave channels to subscribers using MDS and/or Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS). On June 30, 1995, the Commission adopted a Report and Order that established a geographic licensing plan, utilizing a simultaneous multiple round bidding process, under which the Commission would allot one MDS authorization for each of the Rand McNally defined 487 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) and six additional BTA-like geographic areas. The BTA authorization holder would have the exclusive right to construct facilities to provide wireless cable service over any usable MDS channel within the BTA, provided currently authorized and previously proposed MDS stations, as well as the protected service areas and receive sites of ITFS systems, were not interfered with. While the signals of a BTA authorization holder were not allowed to interfere with those of any other BTA authorization holder, the Commission permitted BTA authorization holders to negotiate interference protection rights in recognition of the fact that BTA boundaries did not always track desired service areas. In the Report and Order, the Commission also initiated a variety of measures to   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  25  streamline further the MDS application and implementation processes, for example, authorizing the voluntary use of electronic filing and fee payments for new MDS applications and establishing computerized interference studies using new data elements to be included in the revised MDS application form. Adoption of the new licensing plan and related measures should promote rapid opportunities for MDS to reach its competitive potential. Advanced Television (ATV) is a generic term referring to any system for distributing television that results in improved television audio and video quality. High Definition Television (HDTV) is a type of ATV system. HDTV refers to systems that aim to offer approximately twice the horizontal resolution and twice the vertical resolution of conventional television pictures, which would approach the quality of 35 mm film, and provide sound quality rivaling that of compact discs. In February of 1993 the Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service reported to the Commission that a digital advanced television system was achievable but that the competing systems that it had evaluated would all benefit from further development and that none could be recommended over the others at that time. Three months later, in May of 1993, seven companies and institutions that had been proponents of the tested systems joined together in a ""Grand Alliance"" to develop a final digital advanced television system. They developed such a system and a standard was developed based on it. That system appears capable not only of delivering HDTV but, additionally, of allowing each broadcaster to deliver up to four standard definition television (SDTV) signals in the same amount of frequency space as it currently uses to deliver a single programming stream. On November 28, 1994, the Advisory Committee reported that standard to the Commission and recommended its adoption as the advanced television standard. On July 28, 1995, the Commission adopted a Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Third Notice of Inquiry (Notice) in this proceeding. In that Notice, the Commission noted that the development of the flexible Grand Alliance digital advanced television would enable broadcasters to provide HDTV service, or SDTV service, or other digital services and to switch quickly and easily between these services. This, the Commission reasoned, was a change in circumstance that warranted revisiting a number of previously considered issues. Accordingly, it sought comment on a wide array of issues including digital broadcast programming requirements, eligibility for digital broadcast television licenses, the length of the transition to digital broadcast television, the recovery of spectrum, the value of recovered spectrum, the treatment of noncommercial stations, and cable ""must carry"" requirements. Advanced Television Service (MM Docket No. 87-268)   26 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Children's Television (MM Docket No. 93-48)  In April 1995 the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) seeking comment on proposals to clarify and strengthen its rules implementing the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA). The CTA directs the Commission to review, in any application for license renewal, whether a tele vision broadcast licensee has ""served the educational needs of children through the licensee's overall programming, including programming specifically designed to serve such needs."" The Commission first adopted rules implementing the CTA in 1991. In 1993 the Commission initiated this proceeding by adopting a Notice of Inquiry to examine whether its rules should be revised to identify more clearly the levels and types of programming necessary to serve children's educational needs adequately. In June 1994 the Commission also convened an en banc hearing on the subject of children's television programming. Based on comments responding to the Notice of Inquiry and submitted in conjunction with the en banc hearing, the Commission proposed in the Notice to improve the information available to parents and the local community regarding educational television programming, and to revise its definition of ""core"" educational programming to give licensees clearer guidance regarding the types of programming required by the CTA. In addition, the Commission proposed three alternative options: monitor licensee performance for a specified period of time to determine whether or not efforts to improve the dissemination of information to the public and a clarified definition of educational programming result in a significant increase in such programming; establish a safe harbor quantitative processing guideline specifying an amount of core programming that would represent one means of satisfying the CTA's programming obligation; establish a quantitative programming standard requiring that every station be responsible for airing a minimum amount of core programming. Other proposals in the Notice include allowing stations to meet a quantitative guideline or standard by sponsoring programs shown on other stations. The deadlines for filing comments and reply comments on the Notice have passed, and the Commission is presently evaluating these comments.  Television Ownership Rules (MM Dockets 91-221and 87-8)  The Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making to review its regulations governing television broadcasting and its policies and rules governing terrestrial satellite television stations. The Further Notice proposes a new analytical framework within which to evaluate the Commission's ownership rules applied to television stations and provides a structured approach to a comprehensive economic and diversity analysis of the rules. Both national and local ownership rules are under consideration in this proceeding, as are Limited Marketing Agreements (LMAs) involving television stations. Nationally, an entity   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  27  may generally have an attributable interest in no more than 12 commercial television stations or television stations reaching 25% of the total television house holds. Locally, the ""duopoly"" rule prohibits an entity from having an attributable interest in two or more commercial TV stations whose Grade B contours overlap. The ""one-to-a-market"" rule generally prohibits a party from holding cognizable ownership interests in commercial radio and television stations in the same market. Parties are permitted to own, pursuant to waiver requests, radio-television combinations in the top 25 television markets where there will be at least 30 separately owned broadcast licensees after the combination. Radio-television combinations may also be permitted in the same market involving ""failed"" stations that have not been operated for a substantial period of time. At the close of FY95, these rules were the subject of consideration for possible legislative action. The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to review its broadcast attribution rules. The attribution rules define what interests are cognizable for purposes of applying the multiple ownership rules to specific situations. The multiple ownership rules limit the number of broadcast stations that a single person or entity, directly or indirectly, is permitted to own, operate, or control. The Commission asked for comment on: (1) whether to raise the voting stock attribution benchmarks from 5 percent to 10 percent and from 10 percent to 20 percent for passive investors; (2) whether to restrict the availability of the current exceptions to attribution for minority corporate stockholdings where there is a single majority shareholder and for nonvoting stock; (3) whether to relax insulation standards for business development companies and other widely-held limited partnerships; (4) how to treat limited liability companies and other new business forms for attribution purposes; (5) whether to repeal or retain the remaining aspects of the Commission's crossinterest policy, which prevents individuals from having ""meaningful"" designated interests in two media outlets serving substantially the same area; and (6) whether to adopt a new policy under which the Commission would scrutinize multiple ""cross interests"" or other significant business relationships, when held in combination among ostensibly competing broadcasters, to determine whether the combined interests, which individually would not raise concerns, would raise issues with respect to the Commission's diversity and competition concerns. Broadcast Attribution Rules (MM Dockets Nos. 94-150, 92-51, and 87-154)   28 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Minority and Female Ownership (MM Dockets Nos. 94-149 and 91-140)  The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposing initiatives designed to increase minority and female ownership of mass media facilities. The Notice seeks current data with respect to female ownership and emphasizes that the proposals will be applied to women only if the Commission receives sufficient information to construct a legally sustainable basis for doing so. (The legality of minority preferences was upheld by the Supreme Court in Metro Broadcasting . In its June 12, 1995, decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena , the Supreme Court held that race-based federal affirmative action programs are subject to strict judicial scrutiny. The Commission is in the process of evaluating the impact of this decision.) The major initiatives proposed by the Commission include (1) a reworked version of its earlier ""incubator"" proposal which would permit owners to exceed the appli cable ownership caps if they assist minorities or women in becoming station owners; (2) an exception to the attribution rules that would deem investments in minority and female-controlled facilities non-attributable if a control group of minorities or women hold more than 50 percent of the voting stock and a specified minimum level of equity; and (3) various modifications to the existing minority tax certificate policy. The Notice sought comment on how these and other proposals could apply to all mass media, including broadcast, cable, LPTV and wireless cable facilities. On June 15, 1995, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making initiating an examination of its rules regarding programming practices of broadcast television networks and their affiliates. The Notice specifically addresses the right to reject rule, the time option rule, the exclusive affiliation rule, the dual network rule and the network territorial exclusivity rule. The Notice proposes to retain the right to reject rule with a clarification to eliminate financial considerations as a sole justification for program rejection; to modify the time option rule to permit time option agreements if they contain an appropriate deadline for invoking the option; to eliminate the exclusive affiliation rule, at least in large markets; and to eliminate the first prong of the network territorial exclusivity rule -- prohibiting exclusivity for rejected programs vis-a-vis other stations in the same community, but to retain the second prong of the rule -- prohibiting exclusivity vis-a-vis stations not in the same community. The Commission also asked a series of questions designed to evaluate the costs and benefits of the dual network rule. The Commission has, via this Notice and other related proceedings, put all of the network/affiliate rules out for public comment as part of a comprehensive review.  Broadcast TV Networks and Affiliates: Network Programming Practices (MM Docket No. 95-92)   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  29  On June 14, 1995, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to reexamine two rules regulating broadcast television network/affiliate relationships. The first rule prohibits agreements by which a network can influence or control the rates its affiliates set for the sale of their non-network broadcast time, and the other rule prohibits broadcast television affiliates that are not owned by their networks from being represented by their networks for the sale of non-network advertising time. The Notice requests information that will allow the Commission to ascertain whether the rules continue effectively to promote diversity and competition. Should the record indicate that neither television broadcast networks nor networks and their affiliates have the ability or incentive to manipulate the market price for network or national spot television advertising time, the Commission will consider eliminating or modifying the rules. In addition, it will consider eliminating or modifying the rules if the record indicates that they are ineffective in correcting the public interest harm they were designed to remedy. On the other hand, should the Commission determine that networks, or networks and their a ffiliates, have the ability and incentive to manipulate the market price for network or national spot television advertising time, and that these rules effectively address any resulting public interest harm, it will consider retaining the rules. The Notice also asks whether the rules as currently formulated achieve their intended purpose or if they are readily circumvented. Finally, the Commission will consider the costs the rules may impose and asks commenters to weigh these costs against the rules' potential public interest benefits. This proceeding is part of the Commission's comprehensive review of all its network/affiliate rules. On April 5, 1995, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposing to eliminate or modify the Commission's requirement that broadcast television stations file their network affiliation agreements with the Commission and that these filings be publicly available. The Notice asks several questions about the benefits and costs of these filings. The primary benefit of the rule is that it allows the Commission to continuously monitor network/ affiliate contractual relations. The primary cost is that the rule makes available inform ation which can be used to skew the competition for affiliation agreements. In light of evidence on benefits and costs of these filings, the Notice proposes the Commission take one of several possible actions. First, the Commission might eliminate the filing requirement and depend upon its general ability to obtain the agreements when either the Commission or an outside party thinks there is a need to examine network/affiliate contractual relations. Next, the Commission might continue the filing requirement but either make the filings confidential or redact certain financial information if the filings continue to be publicly available. Finally, the Commission might retain the rule if  Broadcast TV Networks and Affiliates: Advertising Rules (MM Docket No. 95-90)  Broadcast TV Networks and Affiliates: Filing of Network Affiliation Agreements (MM Docket No. 95-40)   30 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  there is no other less burdensome manner in which it can achieve the intent of the rule. This proceeding is part of the Commission's comprehensive review of all its network/affiliate rules.

The fin/syn rules had placed significant restraints on the ability of the three networks to acquire financial interests in television programming and to participate in the syndication market. The Commission originally adopted the fin/syn restrictions in 1970 based upon its belief that the three networks -- ABC, CBS, and NBC -- at that time dominated the market for television programming and thus inhibited the growth of independent and diverse sources and outlets for such programming. The dominance of the networks subsequently declined over the years with the emergence of cable, the Fox network, and independent television stations. As a result, after extensive proceedings, the Commission in 1993 eliminated certain aspects of the fin/syn rules immediately but retained other re strictions for an interim period.   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  31  The new Report and Order was based upon analysis of the market for television programming since that time. The Commission concluded that proponents ofretaining the remaining fin/syn rules had failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that repeal would not serve the public interest. Further, the Commission found that the evidence suggested the need to accelerate elimination of the remaining restrictions. Thus, the Commission directed that the remaining rules be eliminated effective upon publication of the Report and Order summary in the Federal Register , which occurred on September 21, 1995. On July 31, 1995, the Commission issued a Report and Order repealing the Prime Time Access Rule (PTAR) effective August 30, 1996. PTAR generally prohibits television stations affiliated with the ABC, CBS, and NBC networks in the top 50 prime time markets from broadcasting more than three hours of network programming or off-network programming (i.e., reruns of programs formerly shown on the networks) during the four hours of prime time. This rule was adopted in 1970, when the three networks were viewed as dominating the television marketplace, to promote independent sources of television programming and to prevent the networks from dictating affiliate programming choices during the whole of prime time. PTAR also has been seen as furthering the growth of independent stations by providing them greater access to popular off-network programming. The Commission concluded that PTAR is not necessary under today's market conditions. The networks no longer dominate the television marketplace, and the rule places artificial restraints on what affiliates subject to the rule can show during the access period. The Commission determined PTAR is no longer necessary to promote independent sources of television programming, to promote the growth of independent stations or new networks, or to safeguard affiliate autonomy. The Commission provided a oneyear transition period until the final repeal of PTAR to moderate any potential disruption to the marketplace.  Prime Time Access Rule (PTAR) (MM Docket No. 94-123)  At the end of FY95 the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry to assess the current availability, cost, and uses of closed captioning and video description, and to examine what further Commission actions may be appropriate to promote these services. It also asked for comments on the appropriate means of promoting their wider use in programming delivered by television broadcasters, cable operators, and other video programming providers. Closed captioning provides important benefits primarily for individuals with hearing disabilities by displaying the audio portion of a television signal as printed words on the television screen. Video description is a more recent innovation that benefits individuals with vision disabilities. It provides audio descriptions of a program's key visual elements that are inserted during the natural pauses in the program's dialogue.  Closed Captioning/ Video Description Services (MM Docket No. 95-176)   32 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have passed bills which, if enacted, would for the first time generally require the closed captioning of video programming. The submission of the information sought by the NOI may provide a useful foundation for further Commission action whether or not the pending legislation is enacted.   M  ASS  M  EDIA  B  UREAU  33  Mass Media Statistics Current Broadcast Authorizations Outstanding broadcast authorizations for major services at the close of Fiscal Year 1995 totaled 26,341, an increase of 1,302 over Fiscal Year 1994.

The companies providing these services are called common carriers, and are most conveniently thought of as telephone companies, even though they provide a wide range of other services. The 1934 Communications Act requires common carriers to charge reasonable prices. It directs the FCC to review tariffs, authorize facilities, establish accounting rules, and investigate complaints. Most of the regulatory responsibility for these matters resides in the Common Carrier Bureau, although, as part of a major reorganization completed this year, some responsibilities have been divided among different bureaus. The reorganization placed the allocation of radio spectrum and other matters relating to mobile service providers (such as cellular telephone companies) in a new Wireless Telecommunications Bureau. Regulatory responsibilities for certain aspects of international service, including the allocation of satellite orbital slots, were transferred to a new International Bureau. Over 1,300 telephone companies provide local telephone service in the United States. These companies include the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) that formerly were part of the integrated Bell System. As a result of the AT&T divestiture in 1984, the BOCs are now part of seven separate regional holding companies: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, SBC Communications, and U S West. The Bureau is divided into six divisions: The ACCOUNTING AND AUDITS DIVISION deals with a variety of accounting matters including the establishment of accounting systems and the setting of depreciation rates. Its staff also conducts audits of regulated carriers.  Overview   42  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT  The ENFORCEMENT DIVISION handles complaints and other matters related to the enforcement of the Communications Act. All carriers, even those the Commission has chosen not to regulate directly because of their small size, are subject to certain consumer protection requirements, and consumers retain the right to bring their complaints to the Commission. The INDUSTRY ANALYSIS DIVISION tracks industry trends and publishes a variety of statistical reports. It also administers the Commission's programs for assisting low-income subscribers. The NETWORK SERVICES DIVISION handles issues related to telephone numbering, network reliability, and the Commission's registration program to ensure that equipment connected to the telephone system does not harm the telephone network. The POLICY AND PROGRAM PLANNING DIVISION handles legal proceedings establishing and revising many of the Commission's more complex rules. The TARIFF DIVISION reviews tariffs filed by regulated carriers which include the terms and conditions of service offerings as well as prices.  FY95 Highlights   Investigated the rates of a number of Operator Service Providers (OSPs);  Issued Notices of Apparent Liability (NALs) against a variety of interexchange carriers for unauthorized conversion of long distance services (slamming);  Amended rules pertaining to slamming to protect consumers and curtail abuses of letters of agency (LOAs);  Issued the first ever ""Common Carrier Scorecard"" to educate both consumers and carriers about trends and problems in the industry based on actual consumer complaint statistics;  Conducted periodic meetings with both local exchange and inter-exchange carriers to address industry problem areas;  Adopted rules for nationwide Caller ID service.   COMMON CARRIER BUREAU  43  Major Proceedings On July 20, 1995, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comment on ways to increase the level of telephone subscribership in the United States. On May 4, 1995, the Commission affirmed that the widespread availability of Caller ID was in the public interest, and that rules addressing telephone number delivery must balance the privacy interests of both the calling and called parties. The Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 (HAC Act) required the Commission to establish rules that ensure reasonable access to telephone service by persons with hearing disabilities, and to seek to eliminate the disparity between hearing aid users and non-users in obtaining access to the telephone network. In implementing this Act the Commission undertook to resolve certain hearing-aid compatibility issues through a negotiated rulemaking proceeding. In the spring of 1995 the Commission established a 19-member Hearing Aid Compatibility Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. Committee members represented all interested parties, including the Commission, telephone equipment manufacturers, employers, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels and persons with disabilities. The Committee held eight formal meetings over 64 calendar days, and formed working groups which met informally during that same period. The Committee successfully completed its work, reaching consensus on all issues, and, in August 1995 filed a Final Report of its recommendations with the Commission. The Commission stated that it planned to consider aNotice of Proposed Rulemaking these rules in on the fall. On July 13, 1995, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on a wide variety of policy and technical issues concerning number portability. Telephone numbers are critical to the routing of telephone calls over the public switched network in the United States because they generally identify a particular customer being called and a particular service provider. As a consequence, telecommunications customers cannot generally retain their telephone numbers if they wish to change service pro Telephone Number Portability (CC Docket No. 95-116)  Subscribership Levels and Public Switched Network Use (CC Docket 95-115).  Caller ID (CC Docket 91-281)  Hearing Aid Compatibility (CC Docket 87-124)   44  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT  viders or geographic locations. Number portability is the ability of customers to retain their telephone numbers when they switch service providers, services, and/or locations. The Commission'sNotice examines the public interest benefits and costs of various forms of number portability. End User Common Line Charges for ISDN (CC Docket No. 95-72)  On May 30, 1995, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the application of Subscriber Line Charges (SLCs) to services providing multiple voice-grade-equivalent channels over a single facility. These services, such as integrated services digital network (ISDN) service, permit customers to obtain digital transmission over existing copper wire, through the use of advanced equipment. In addition to obtaining multiple channels over a single local loop or T-1 facility, these services can transmit data at higher speeds and with greater accuracy. The Commission stated in opening this proceeding that it must be careful to avoid creating regulatory barriers to the development of beneficial new technologies, particularly when those services and technologies can facilitate access to the benefits of the National Information Infrastructure. At the same time, it should not favor one technology or service over others. On June 13, 1995, the Commission adopted a Report and Orderamending the rules concerning the Letters of Agency (LOAs) used to change the long-distance carrier of a telephone customer. The new rule requires that LOAs be separate from inducements such as prizes or contests, and that they clearly state that, by signing the LOA, the consumer is requesting a change in his long-distance service. In conjunction with the amendment of the rules concerning the unauthorized conversion of long-distance service, the Enforcement Division initiated a series of investigations into carrier ""slamming"" practices. Notably, one carrier was fined for converting a widow's telephone service by forging the signature of her husband, who had been deceased for three years.  Policies and Rules Concerning Unauthorized Conversion of Long Distance Carriers (CC Docket No. 94-129)   COMMON CARRIER BUREAU  45   The seven regional companies with Bell origins serve most of the major metropolitan areas. They serve about 50% of the land mass of the United States and 75% of the population. The rest of the local companies (also called local exchange carriers or LECs) include more than a thousand small independent telephone companies and several larger holding companies such as GTE.  In the aggregate, the revenues of LECs exceeded $100 billion in 1995. About $60 billion was received for local services and subscriber line charges; more than $25 billion was charged to long distance carriers; and the remaining $15 billion was received primarily from short distance toll calls completed in their own service territories. In recent years new local companies have begun to install fiber optic cable to service major business customers and lay the foundations for local competition. As of FY1995, however, the new entrants remained tiny in comparison to the established LECs.  Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) is one of the fastest-growing segments of the telecommunications industry. During the first two years of TRS (1993 - 1995) interstate minutes of TRS use grew at an average rate of approximately 1.5 percent per month. During the 1994 calendar year, the total volume of TRS calls was approximately 136 million minutes of use, including approximately 120 million minutes of intrastate use and 16 million min of utes interstate use. For the 1995 calendar year, NECA estimates usage will be a total of 151 million minutes, including 133 million minutes of intrastate use and 18 million minutes of interstate use.  For most of this century, AT&T provided virtually all of the nation's long distance telephone service. Beginning in the 1970s, other firms began to enter the industry. Today, there are several hundred companies that provide long distance telephone service. In 1995 AT&T provided about 56% of the nation's service; MCI about 18%; Sprint 9%; and smaller carriers accounted for the remaining 17%. In addition to $13 billion of short distance toll calls handled by LECs, the long distance carriers provided $75 billion of services.  The most rapidly growing component of long distance calling is in the international market. During 1995 American callers were billed more than $13 billion for international calls. The regulation of international calls, especially the prices charged for international calls, is a responsibility the Common Carrier Bureau shares with the International Bureau.  Common Carrier Facts   46  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   W  IRELESS  TELECOMMUNICATIONS B  UREAU  47  WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU  The Wireless TelecommunicationsBureau was officially established on December 1, 1994, to manage all Federal Communications Commission domestic wireless telecommunications programs and policies, except those involving satellite communications. The functions include licensing, enforcement and regulatory duties. The Bureau also is responsible for implementing competitive bidding authority for spectrum auctions, given to the Commission by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. To meet its important mission, the Bureau is dedicated to the following goals: 1. To foster competition among different services. 2. To promote universal service, public safety and service to individuals with disabilities. 3. To maximize efficient use of spectrum. 4. To develop a framework for analyzing market conditions for wireless services. 5. To minimize regulation where appropriate. 6. To promote the offering of new and innovative services, particularly by small businesses and new entrants. 7. To serve WTB customers efficiently (including improving licensing, eliminating backlogs, disseminating information and making staff accessible). 8. To enhance consumer protection and outreach and to improve the enforcement process.  Overview   48  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  During 1995 the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau continued to pursue new and innovative ways to meet its customers' needs. Below are several examples: Promoting Competition  During FY95 the Bureau has rapidly and efficiently implemented the first successful spectrum auction process. Auctions have proven to be a fast, fair and efficient mechanism to introduce competition in wireless services quickly, without regulatory delay.  The Bureau issued licenses in record time to jumpstart competition. In the Broadband PCS auction, licensees received their licenses just four months after the conclusion of the auction.  The Bureau promoted competition in wireless services through its development of the Commission's policy positions in such areas as LEC-CMRS interconnection, resale, flexible service definitions such as PCS and General Wireless Communications Services. Furthermore, the Bureau has played a leading role in fostering wireless competition in the local loop.  Promoting the Public Interest   During FY95 the Bureau formed the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee to identify spectrum for public safety use and to create a comprehensive scheme for the creation of an interoperable federal, state and local public safety network. This Committee is jointly led by the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The Bureau increased its efforts to coordinate with the FTC and other Government agencies to eliminate ""application mills."" Application mills are entities which encourage filing of speculative applications which lead to processing backlogs and license ""flipping,"" both of which delay the delivery of valuable services to the public. The Bureau began working with the wireless industry and the hearing-impaired community to ensure that the benefits of wireless telecommunications will be available to hearing-impaired individuals throughout America.  Working Better and Smarter   The Bureau has reduced application backlog by reducing bureaucratic delay in licensing and allowing licensees to provide service more quickly. The new Bureau inherited a significant backlog of more than 189,000 applications and initiated an aggressive backlog reduction program which reduced the backlog by nearly 65%.   W  IRELESS  TELECOMMUNICATIONS B  UREAU  49   The Bureau implemented electronic filing procedures, which have reduced processing time from an average of 75 days in the Amateur service to next day service. Electronic filing is rapidly being implemented in all application processes.  In mid-August, the Consumer Assistance Branch implemented a new telehone procedure which allows callers to listen to pre-recorded messages while waiting for a representative. The first message gives the option of faxing future inquiries. Our monthly fax receipts from that point on have more than tripled. A response is made to the requestor within 24 hours, thus enhancing our accessibility to our customers.  FY95 Highlights  Broadband Personal Communications Services auction raised $7.7 billion for the United States Treasury and enabled two new wireless licensees in \each market to increase competition in the wireless industry.  Narrowband Regional Personal Communications Service auction raised each market to offer services such as two-way paging, voice messaging and information services.  Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee formed.  The FCC's first electronic filing process was developed, which provides significant cost and time savings to both the FCC and the public.  Allocation of spectrum below 5 GHz transferred from Federal Government use as specified in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.  Acting on WTB recommendations, the Commission has issued a series of orders eliminating state rate regulation of wireless services.  Major Proceedings On March 13, 1995, the FCC concluded the auction of 99 PCS licenses. A total of 18 winning bidders together bid $7 billion for these 99 licenses in 51 Major Trading Areas (MTAs). Two licenses were awarded in each area, except where one of the two licenses in each of those markets previously went to ""pioneer's preference"" winners: Omnipoint, Cox, and American Personal Com munications. These ""pioneers"" paid a total of $700 million for their licenses, bringing the total for these licenses to $7.7 billion. Conclusion of Broadband PCS Blocks A and B Auction   50  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  This auction is recognized in the Guiness Book of World Records as the largest auction ever. Broadband Personal Communications Services (Broadband PCS) is broadly defined by the Federal Communications Commission as ""radio communications that encompass mobile and ancillary fixed communication services that provide services to individuals and businesses and can be integrated with a variety of competing networks."" For example, PCS phone service could be used in the development of more advanced cellular phone services which would be able to pinpoint the subscriber in any given locale. The frequency would allow the signal to be transmitted a greater distance and in this case, would ""roam"" with the subscriber. This would eliminate the need for many different phone lines (i.e., car phones) and would probably be much less costly. The FCC's auctions of Broadband PCS licenses helped kick off an entirely new industry. Analysts predict that within ten years, there could be 100 million wireless telephone subscribers -- an increase of more than 70 million. The creation of this new industry is estimated to generate billions of dollars of future investment and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Competition in the PCS industry will benefit consumers and businesses. The FCC's licensing plan for this spectrum provides for up to four new full service providers of wireless services in each market. Consumers will be able to choose from multiple providers and will receive lower prices and better services as a result. Businesses will increase their productivity and enhance efficient delivery of products because they will have greater choice among service providers and more advanced telecommunications services. Businesses also will benefit by pro viding a supporting role to this new industry, in construction of infrastructure, software development, etc. Conclusion of Regional Narrowband PCS Auction On October 26, 1994, the FCC concluded the auction of 30 narrowband PCS licenses. The 30 licenses covered five geographic areas, with 6 licenses in each area. A total of nine winning bidders together bid $489 million for these licenses. After reducing the winning bids by the 40 percent bidding credit small businesses owned by women and minorities received, the net revenues for this auction were $395 million. Narrowband PCS is different from broadband PCS because each license provides the licensee with the right to provide service over a smaller portion of the spectrum. Narrowband licenses typically allow operation on 50 kHz channels paired with 50 kHz channels, 50 kHz channels paired with 12.5 kHz channels, or unpaired 50 kHz channels. Broadband licenses allow operation on either 30 MHz channels or 10 MHz channels.   W  IRELESS  TELECOMMUNICATIONS B  UREAU  51  The FCC defined narrowband PCS as a ""family of mobile and portable radio communications services which could provide services to individuals and businesses, and be integrated with a variety of cometing networks."" The FCC anticipated that advanced paging and messaging services would be the predominant narrowband services provided. In an effort to ensure broad participation by small businesses and minority and women-owned businesses, firms identified by the FCC as designated entities, the FCC provided a 40 percent bidding credit on 10 of 30 licenses: one 50 kHz/50 KHz paired channel and one 50 kHz/12.5 kHz channel in each of the five regions. The 40 percent bidding credit was another measure to ensure meaningful participation by minority and women-owned businesses in the emerging PCS industry. The FCC also offered other provisions designed to reduce entry barriers faced by small businesses and minority and women-owned businesses, including installment payments, bidding credits and tax certificates. These incentives seem to be a successful method of attracting broad participation by small businesses and minority and women-owned firms. Twenty of the 28 qualified bidders in this auction identified their firm as a minority-owned business, women-owned business, or small business. Of the nine winning bidders, four were qualified as small businesses that are owned by minorities and/ or women. In these Orders, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau addressed challenges to the licensing of the Personal Communications Service A and B Blocks, including a request that licensing be stayed until the conclusion of subsequent Personal Communications Service auctions. The Bureau rejected these challenges and granted the licenses, concluding that the immediate grant of the licenses would introduce competition into the wireless marketplace and was in the public interest. The auction and licensing process was considerably faster than the comparable licensing process for cellular and other wireless services in which lotteries or comparative hearings were used. In this auction, and in the regional narrowband auction, licensees received their licenses approximately four months after the conclusion of the auction. On February 7, 1995, the Commission adopted the First Report and Order , and on July 31, 1995, the Commission adopted the Second Report and Order in response to directives contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, mandating steps to be taken leading to the transfer of spectrum below 5 GHz currently assigned for use by the Federal Government to the private sector. Commission actions to this end taken in 1995: PCS Licensing Orders  Transfer of Spectrum from Federal Government Use (ET Docket 94-32)   52  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  States' Petitions to Regulate CMRS Rates (PR Docket No. 94-109)  (1) Allocated the 2390-2400 MHz band for use by unlicensed Personal Communications Services devices, providing for continued use of the 2402 MHz band by devices operating in accordance with Part 15 of the Commission's Rules, allocating both of these bands for use by the Amateur service on a primary basis, and allocating the band 4660-4685 MHz for use by Fixed and Mobile services. (2) Created the General Wireless Communications Service (GWCS) to operate in the 4660-4685 MHz band. The GWCS service continues the Commission's efforts to promote flexible use of spectrum, and allow the market to determine how spectrum should be allocated From May 4, 1995, through August 8, 1995, the Commission adopted a series of orders denying seven states the authority to continue regulating intrastate rates for cellular and other commercial radio services, on the grounds that the petitions filed by Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, New York and Ohio did not meet the statutory standard established by Congress; that market conditions fail to protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates or unjustly and unreasonably discriminatory rates. These steps ended state regulation of rates cellular carriers charge and promoted competition by allowing a competitive marketplace to determine wireless rates.  PLMRS (PR Docket No. 92-235)  On June 15, 1995, the Commission adopted a proceeding containing a Report and Order that dealt with three main issues in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services: channelization, transition time, and consolidation of radio services. The Order established a narrowband channel plan that facilitates the use of spectrally-efficient equipment, and provides for a technology neutral transition that allows users the opportunity to continue using their existing equipment and gradually migrate to narrower channels as the need arises. Additionally, the Order encouraged industry to reach a consensus plan to consolidate frequency coordinators and submit their proposal to the Commission. The proceeding contained a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposes to introduce market-based incentives such as exclusivity, competitive bidding, and user fees into the Private Land Mobile Radio Services. Marketbased incentives would encourage efficient spectrum usage and allow users to make the equipment choices which best address their needs.   W  IRELESS  TELECOMMUNICATIONS B  UREAU  53   54  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   C  OMPLIANCE AND INFORMATION  B  UREAU  55  Compliance and Information Bureau  In order to describe more clearly the nature of the Bureau's service to the public and to its other customers, the name of the former Field Operations Bureau (FOB) was changed to the Compliance and Information Bureau (CIB) on December 1, 1 994. During FY95 CIB undertook a comprehensive management staff review of its mission, functions, processes and organizational structure in accordance with principles outlined in the National Performance Review. The resulting reorganization of the Bureau will result in the streamlining of CIB's operations and the creation of a more effective organization that will achieve significant savings in operational costs. The Bureau's vision statement is to ensure commu nications excellence. The mission of the Compliance and Information Bureau is to support the nation's communications capability by fostering sound communications policy, promoting compliance with that policy, informing the public, and using its technical expertise to solve communications problems. The Bureau is in the business of informing the public about FCC regulations, policies, practices, and procedures; informing the Commissioners and the other Bureaus about telecommunications problems and about the needs of the users; obtaining compliance with FCC rules; and using its expertise in communications technology to solve problems. CIB carries out its programs to serve the public and the Commission through a number of field offices located throughout the United States. The field activities, in turn, are directed by three regional offices. Program and policy development for CIB is the responsibility of the Bureau's divisions and other offices located at the FCC's headquarters in Washington, D.C. CIB's compliance program is administered by the ENFORCEMENT DIVISION and is designed to ensure that U.S. radio laws and Commission rules are observed. The compliance program involves staff activities such as inspecting radio stations for compliance with the Communications Act and Commission Rules, investigating the unlicensed or unauthorized operation of radio stations, resolving radio frequency interference problems, inspecting and  Overview   56  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  certifying ship radio stations, and providing assistance to public safety and law enforcement agencies experiencing radio communications problems. CIB pursues administrative sanctions, as well as civil and criminal court actions, against persons and entities that violate the Communications Act and/or the Commission's rules. The Enforcement Division is composed of the Investigations Branch, the Signal Analysis Branch, and the Legal Branch. During FY95 the Enforcement Division initiated a proceeding entitled Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Matter of the Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and Amendment of Section 1.80 of the Rules to Incorporate the Forfeiture Guidelines . Additionally, the Division conducted a number of significant information gathering and investigative initiatives for other Commission bureaus and offices during the fiscal year and engaged in various activities to inform, assist and educate licensees, user groups, industry groups and the general public about matters within the Commission's jurisdiction. CIB's INFORMATION STAFF develops, produces and delivers information dissemination products and services that support the overall mission of the Commission and CIB's goals and objectives. The Information Staff experienced an extremely busy FY95 that included performing a major role in the comprehensive study and review of the Bureau, as well as the planning, development and execution of a Public Affairs Specialist Training Workshop for the Bureau. The EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM STAFF of CIB is also a vital part of the Bureau's Information Staff. On November 10, 1994, the Commission adopted a Report and Order initiated and prepared by the EAS Staff that replaced the old Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) with a new Emergency Alert System (EAS) that represents a vast technical and operational improvement over the old one. CIB's ENGINEERING DIVISION supports the Bureau's enforcement and public information functions through the Equipment and Standards Branch in Washington, D.C., the Equipment Construction and Installation Branch in Powder Springs, Georgia, and the Advanced Technology Group in Columbia, Maryland. The Equipment and Standards Branch (ESB) establishes and reviews technical measurement procedures to determine compliance with FCC regulations and to provide regulatory feedback. It also develops technical specifications for equipment used by FCC f ield offices, provides facilities used by these offices, and analyzes and interprets data collected by field offices to improve Bureau effectiveness. The Equipment and Construction and Installation Branch (ECIB) designs and constructs specialized equipment for field use that can not be purchased or economically contracted for in small quantities. It also has a patent program to protect the Commission's investment in unique devices developed   C  OMPLIANCE AND INFORMATION  B  UREAU  57  by the Branch. The Advanced Technology Group (ATG) analyzes communications technology advances, applies new technologies to CIB's activities and provides information and identifies training needs to keep field staff abreast of technological developments. The Engineering Division experienced an extremely busy FY95. In addition to its routine duties, it provided a great deal of innovative technical planning and support to the comprehensive study and review of the Bureau undertaken during the past fiscal year.

A CIB rulemaking proceeding that sought comments on the Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and proposed to amend Section 1.80 of the Rules to incorporate the monetary forfeiture policy statement guidelines for assessing forfeitures. In July 1994 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement, finding that, as implemented by the Commission, the Policy Statement had the effect of a rule and thus was improperly issued without notice and comment. In the proceeding the Commission proposed monetary forfeiture guidelines that were virtually identical to the guidelines in effect prior to the Court's decision and sought comments on all aspects of the proposal. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Matter of Amendment of Part 80 of the Commission's Rules Regarding the Inspection of Great Lakes Agreement Ships, CI Docket No. 95-54 -- adopted April 24, 1995, and released May 16, 1995. A CIB rulemaking proceeding that proposed to allow owners and operators of ships subject to the annual inspection requirements of the Great Lakes Agreement to have inspections performed by a private sector classification society instead of by the Commission, reducing economic burdens on the public and the Commission while ensuring maritime safety.

Prior to the establishment of the Bureau, international policy activities and other international functions were distributed across four Bureaus and two Offices within the Commission. The International Bureau develops, recommends and administers policies, standards, procedures and programs for the authorization and regulation of international telecommunications facilities and services, the licensing of domestic and international satellite systems, and the authorization and regulation of international broadcast stations. The Bureau advises and recommends to the Commission, or acts for the Commission under delegated authority, in the development and administration of international telecommunications policies and programs. The Bureau serves as the Commission's representative in matters involving international organizations. It consists of three divisions: Telecommunications, Satellite and Radiocommunication, and Planning and Negotiations. The TELECOMMUNICATIONS DIVISION deals with the authorization and regulation of international telecommunications facilities and services. It represents the Commission at international conferences and meetings involving non-radio related telecommunications matters. The Division directs and coordinates Commission participation in bilateral telecommunications discussions and provides assistance in telecommunications trade negotiations. The Telecommunications Division consists of two branches: Policy and Facilities Branch and Multilateral and Development Branch. The SATELLITE AND RADIOCOMMUNICATION DIVISION deals with policies, rules, procedures and standards for licensing and regulating satellite space and earth station facilities, both domestic and international. It under  Overview   62  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  takes Commission responsibilities under the Communications Satellite Act f or the oversight of Comsat as the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT and Inmarsat. The Division represents the Commission in international conferences and meetings involving radio-related telecommunications matters such as satellites, spectrum allocation, standards, broadcasting, aviation, maritime and safety of life at sea in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other international fora. The Division directs and coordinates within the Commission and with other federal agencies Commission preparation for various interagency and international meetings. The Satellite and Radiocommunication Division consists of three branches: Radiocommunication Policy Branch, Satellite Policy Branch and Satellite Engineering Branch. The PLANNING AND NEGOTIATIONS DIVISION directs and coordinates, in consultation with other bureaus and offices as appropriate, Commission negotiations with Mexico, Canada and other nearby countries regarding international agreements. The Division represents the Commission in international conferences and meetings involving radio frequency assignment related matters and ensures that Commission regulations, procedures and frequency allocations comply with international and bilateral agreements. The Planning and Negotiations Division consists of two branches: Negotiations Branch and Notifications Branch. The International Bureau maintains a public reference center containing all nondocketed public files of Bureau related matters, enabling the public to satisfy all international and satellite reference needs at one central location. The public reference center is located at 2000 M Street, N.W., Room 102, Washington, D.C. 20554. Types of documents available include: Applications and authori zations (International Section 214; international earth station; domestic and international space stations; domestic and international earth stations; direct broadcast satellite; cable landing; international public fixed radio and recognized private operating agency); released Intelsat and Inmarsat documents; international treaties and agreements; international operating agreements; ITU publications; tariff and accounting rate information.  FY95 Highlights  In its first year, the International Bureau raised the standard of government service, consistently working to streamline processes and develop new and effective ways to do its work. To date the Bureau has:  Held four public roundtable discussions with industry to solicit its views on necessary regulatory changes and, based on these discussions, prepared a package of regulatory and legislative initiatives.   INTERNATIONAL B  UREAU  63   Established the use of a status conference for all applications which have not been acted upon within six months of filing.  Reduced the statutory comment public notice period from 45 days after public notice to 30 days for issuance of Section 214 authorizations in routine cases.  Established new procedures to permit the grant of Special Temporary Authority in authorizing certain satellite earth station applications and for pro forma transfers of 214 licenses -- allowing industry immediately to provide (and consumers immediately to receive) services without unnecessary regulatory processing delays.  Increased the use of Section 319(d) waiver procedures to permit applicants to proceed with the construction of satellite space stations (at their own risk) pending action on the underlying applications.  Granted 173 earth station renewal applications, in an unprecedented 10-day period, clearing the way for continued delivery of video programming, data transmission and telecommunications services.  Held roundtable discussions and started crackdown on international dial-aporn abuses ( indecent or obscene, recorded or live, conversations that are offered over the telephone on a commercial basis by information providers located in foreign countries).   Submitted information for advanced publication on 101 satellite networks, including 26 non-government domestic networks. Also submitted 140 requests for coordination with foreign systems.  Submitted 12,226 notifications, including 77 notices for the space radiocommunications services, 4,012 notifications of quarterly schedules of international high-frequency broadcasting stations, 896 AM broadcast stations and 7,241 notifications of terrestrial assignments.   64  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Major Proceedings Complementing these process reinvention achievements noted above, the Bureau has successfully completed a very ambitious substantive agenda, including the following most significant accomplishments: WRC-95  The success of the United States proposals at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-95) exceeded all expectations and paved the way for the introduction of innovative global communication satellite networks proposed by U.S. industry by securing key allocation and regul atory measures. Remain -ing work on several important items related to these efforts will be carried forward to WRC-97. WRC-95 also achieved a major simplification of the International Radio Regulations. Part 25 Streamlining Proceeding Since its inception, the International Bureau has pursued policies to ensure that the Commission's goal of fostering growth within the satellite communications industry is achieved. The last review of the Commission's rules in this area (47 C.F.R., Part 25) occurred in the late 1980s, and satellite technology has evolved significantly since that time. In August 1995 the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) designed to eliminate any outmoded and cumbersome regulatory requirements and increase the efficiency of space and earth station licensing process to enable carriers to more quickly respond to the evolving needs of a global telecommunications marketplace.  Part 25 Streamlining Proceeding  International Section 214 Streamlining Proceeding  On July 13, 1995, the Commission proposed rules and regulations to streamline the international Section 214 application process and tariff requirements. The proposed rules would greatly reduce the regulatory burdens on applicants, authorized carriers, and the Commission and provide them with greater flexibility to meet the evolving needs of a global telecommunications market.  Digital Audio Radio Service (DARS)  In June 1995 the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to solicit comments on how to develop service rules and policies to govern the licensing and operation of satellite digital audio radio service (DARS) operating in the 2310-2360 MHz frequency bands. The NPRM proposed options for selecting DARS licensees including licensing the four pending applicants for all or part of the spectrum or reopening the proceeding to new applicants, the NPRM also requested comment on the impact of Satellite DARS on terrestrial broadcasts and possible rules for the design of DARS service.   INTERNATIONAL B  UREAU  65  The Commission adopted a Report and Order establishing a market entry standard for foreign carriers seeking to provide basic international telecommunications services under Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act). The Report and Order also establishes a standard by which the Commission will review whether it is in the public interest to permit foreign investment in licensees of common carrier radio facilities in excess of the benchmarks contained in Section 310(b)(4) of the Act.  Market Entry of Foreign Affiliated Entities  The Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration confirming that international ""call-back"" service using uncompleted call signalling violates neither U.S. nor international law. ""Call-back"" offerings enable customers abroad to access U.S. international service and pay U.S. rates for international calls rather than the generally higher prices charged by foreign carriers. The Commission agreed with the Department of State that call-back is not prohibited or otherwise restricted by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) regulations. The FCC reaffirmed its view, as a matter of international comity, that U.S. call-back operators are not authorized to provide uncompleted call signalling in those countries whose laws explicitly prohibit this offering. In October 1994 the Commission adopted licensing rules for a new type of mobile satellite service -- the ""Big LEO"" service -- operating in the 16101626.5/2483.5-2500 MHz bands. Systems of this new type could be used to provide integrated communications services to all parts of the world, including areas where telecommunications has been unavailable or prohibitively expensive for most inhabitants. In January 1995 the Commission authorized three applicants to build and launch ""Big LEO"" satellite systems, which will deploy the world's first commercial LEO satellites capable of providing voice and data mobile services on a global basis. In 1995 the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to eliminate the outdated regulatory framework that distinguished domestic satellite systems from international satellite systems, and to allow all U.S.-licensed satellites in the fixed-satellite service (FFS) systems, mobile satellite service (MSS) systems and direct broadcast satellite service (DBS) systems. These proposals would enhance the opportunity for the provision of innovative satellite service offerings and increased competition in satellite communication services without artificial regulatory barriers.  Call-Back  Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) Systems Above the GHz (Big LEOs)  DISCO I   66  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS)  The Commission conducted its first ever Direct Broadcast Satellite auctions in January 1996, less than four months after it affirmed an International Bureau decision to reclaim channels held by DBS permittee Advanced Communications Corporation (ACC). The auctions raised $735 million for the U.S. Treasury. The Commission will soon issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (DISCO II) to address questions of U.S. market entry for non-U.S. -licensed satellites and foreign-originated programming. DBS is a service which permits satellite delivery of video programming directly to homes via 18"" receive dishes. Mexico - Several meetings were held with representatives of the Mexican Government over the past year. The primary focus of the negotiations efforts was the establishment of new agreements to facilitate coordination of designated services in specific frequency bands. A significant milestone was reached on May 16th at the Bi-National Consultative Commission on Telecommunications Meeting when two new Protocols were signed governing the bilateral use of spectrum by providers of the newly launched Broadband and Narrowband Personal Communications Services (PCS). Canada - Discussions with Canada continued on a variety of issues. The long term project of creating a General Coordination Agreement to update the 1962 Above 30 MHz Agreement and consolidate all of its associated interim arrangements continued to show progress. New versions of 220-222 MHz Land Mobile and Mobile Earth Terminal draft agreements were exchanged.  International Negotiations: Canada & Mexico   INTERNATIONAL B  UREAU  67    C  ABLE  TELEVISION B  UREAU  69  Cable Services Bureau  The Cable Services Bureau administers and enforces cable television rules and licenses private microwave radio facilities used by cable systems. The Bureau is charged with implementing the 1992 Cable Television and Consumer Protection and Competition Act which directed the Commission to ensure good service and reasonable rates for cable television subscribers n ationwide . At the close of FY95 the Cable Services Bureau employed 186 people. The Bureau is organized into four Divisions: Consumer Protection and Competition, Policy and Rules, Financial Analysis, and Compliance, and Engineering and Technical Services. The Bureau also has an Office of Government and Public Outreach. Since the institution of cable rate regulation, the Bureau has been pursuing enforcement of the rate regulations by using a number of methods: responding to numerous telephone calls and letters from cable subscribers regarding rates and service and investigating more than 7,000 rate complaints from subscribers and local officials. The Bureau began to issue orders based on the complaints in the last quarter of calendar year 1994; issued 62 Letters of Inquiry to various cable operators in regard to their cable rate and service offerings; took action resolving 137 must carry petitions; issued six tax certificates; issued orders involving seven areas of dominant influence (ADI) modifications; handled 57 significantly viewed cases; released 141 orders resolving appeals of local rate orders; resolved 137 challenges by cable operators of the certification of local franchising authorities based on assertions that effective competition exists in the communities in question; resolved 15 leased access cases; resolved 78 must-carry complaints and nine retransmission consent disputes; resolved four program access complaints; and resolved 25 petitions for reconsideration. The Bureau has made great efforts in outreach to and education of its primary customers -- cable subscribers, cable operators, state and local governments, and members of Congress, for which it serves as a single point of contact for cable related issues before the Commission. The Office of Government and Public Outreach was created in April 1995 to sustain and improve the Bureau's customer service. The Bureau is developing a comprehensive outreach program to increase informed participation in rulemaking process by local fran-  Overview   70  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  chising authorities (LFAs) and other interested parties; to educate LFAs in, and facilitate the implementation of, FCC regulations at the local level; and to improve communication and understanding among the FCC, cable regulators, and the cable industry. The Cable Services Bureau's outreach program has established a relationship with national, state, and local trade associations who assist with the distribution and dissemination of Bureau-released information. In addition, it coordinates meetings with various groups having either a general or specific interest in cable regulation and provides briefings on various aspects of cable regulation and the cable industry on a regular basis upon request of interested parties. Resolution of thousands of cable programming services (CPS) rate complaints was one of the Bureau's most important activities this past year. In FY95 the Bureau responded to 944 written congressional inquiries and provided information and assistance to numerous congressional staff members working on the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The staff participated in various meetings with congressional staff to review and respond to certain aspects of the then proposed legislation. In FY95 the Bureau's customer service assistants responded to a total 72,655 telephone inquiries relating to cable television service and regulation. This same staff responded to 26,920 informal inquiries and complaints regarding cable service. The Bureau is very active in educating the public and staff about the Bureau's customer service standards. It operates several hotlines for answering general inquiries from the public, local franchise authorities and cable operators. It prepares and maintains Fact Sheets addressing such issues as Customer Service Standards, Signal Quality Standards, Program Content Rules, Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations, Equal Employment Opportunity Rules, and the Cable Television Information Bulletin. Resolution of thousands of cable programming services (CPS) rate complaints was one of the Bureau's most important activities this past year. The Bureau's goal is to ensure that cable operators' CPS rates are not unreasonable. The Bureau issued over 700 rate decisions as a result of a review of over 11,000 rate complaints. Of the number of cable operator petitions for reconsideration (filed with the Bureau) or applications for review (filed with the Commission) of the Bureau's rate decisions, approximately 70% were brought to resolution through the Bureau's ambitious efforts to negotiate rate settlements and social contracts with the country's major cable operators. The Bureau's efforts not only reduced administrative burdens on all parties, but provided subscribers with immediate refunds. In total, the Bureau has resolved rate complaints involving 33.3 million subscribers resulting in $48.8 million in refunds.   C  ABLE  TELEVISION B  UREAU  71  The two major social contract initiatives achieved by the Bureau in 1995 were the Continental Cablevision, Inc., Social Contract and the Time Warner Social Contract. The Continental Cablevision, Inc., Social Contract provided an estimated $9.5 million in subscriber refunds and established a reduced lifeline basic service tier rate 15% - 20% below otherwise justified rate levels. In addition, Continental Cablevision, Inc., committed to invest $1.35 billion during the period 1995-2000 for domestic cable system upgrades. In return, Continental Cablevision, Inc., was permitted to establish regional average equipment rates and was permitted to create a migrated product tier (MPT) at the per channel CPS tier rate, with permission to move the MPT to a new product tier (NPT) in 20 months and begin pricing the NPT in accordance with the Commission's Going Forward Rate Rules. Under the Time Warner Social Contract subscribers were provided with an estimated $4.7 million (plus interest) in refunds in the form of subscriber bill credits. Time Warner agreed to establish a lifeline basic service tier priced at 10% below permitted rate regulated basic service tier levels, and agreed to allow its subscribers the right to remove, replace, rearrange or maintain any cable wiring located in the interior space of the subscriber's dwelling unit. Time Warner committed to invest $4 billion in domestic cable system upgrades over the next 5 years and agreed to provide free service connections at one outlet in all existing public schools (K-12) within 200 feet of a Time Warner activated plant and within its service area. (Schools beyond 200 feet are to be provided this connection at cost.) Additionally, secondary private schools that receive funding under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and that are within Time Warner's service area are to receive service connections at cost. All schools receiving these connections will also receive a monthly educational program guide having curriculum support ideas to assist educators in effectively using the new services. Time Warner also agreed to provide its on-line service free (when this service becomes available) to these schools upon request, and agreed to provide the first modem free of charge and additional modems at cost. In return, Time Warner was permitted to increase its CPS rates by no more than $1 per year for each of the next five years, plus external costs and inflation. The Social Contract also provided Time Warner the right to create a MPT, consist ing of four channels in systems that did not have prior a la carte offerings and permitted Time Warner to create two MPTs in systems where low penetration a la carte offerings had been previously offered, however the total channels permitted to be migrated in these areas may not exceed six. Depending on the MPT offering, the MPTs must be priced based on a specified $.29/channel cap, the current rate or the lowest uniform rate where a contiguous system offered a  The two major social contract initiatives achieved by the Bureau in 1995 were the Continental Cablevision, Inc., Social Contract and the Time Warner Social Contract.   72  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  NPT under the Commission's rules. Time Warner may convert its MPTs to NPT after April 1997 and begin pricing the NPT in accordance with the Commission's Going Forward Rate Rules.  FY95 Highlights  Negotiated cable rate complaints settlements and social contracts that w ill, when finally implemented, refund nearly $40 million dollars in overcharges to consumers.  Responded to over 100,000 phone calls, letters and other inquiries from the public regarding cable television service.  As required by the 1992 Cable Act, adopted two items easing the burdens of regulation for small cable systems  Conducted the Second Annual Report to Congress on the status of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming. The Report found that, although more consumers are receiving video programming through alternatives tocable, the cable subscribership con tinues to dwarf the combined subscribership of its competitors.  Major Proceedings Headend Upgrades (MM Docket 92-266)  In FY95 the Commission decided that its requirement that qualifying small systems choose between a streamlined cost-of-service procedure for recovering the headend costs of new channels and the per channel adjustment methodology available to all cable operators when they add new channels was insufficient to give qualifying systems an appropriate incentive to add new channels. Accordingly, in the Seventh Order on Reconsideration , the Commission revised its rules to allow independent small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs to recover for each channel added by using both the per channel adjustment methodology and the streamlined cost-of-service procedure for upgrading headend equipment. The Commission also determined that limiting eligibility to use the streamlined cost-of-service procedure for upgrading headend equipment to independent small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs may not have given slightly larger systems an appropriate incentive to add channels. Thus, the Order allows larger systems to use the streamlined cost of service approach subject to the same conditions as independent   C  ABLE  TELEVISION B  UREAU  73  small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs, provided that (a) the systems are either independently owned or owned by small MSOs and (b) the monthly per subscriber cost of the additional headend equipment necessary to receive an additional channel is one cent or more. The Commission further streamlined the cost-of-service procedure for headend upgrades associated with channel additions on single-tier systems. In the Order, the Commission recognized that qualifying systems have the same small customer base over which to spread the cost of new equipment associated with providing additional channels, whether or not they have cable programming service tiers (CPSTs). In FY95 the Commission adopted the Ninth Order on Reconsideration , ending the freeze on small cable television system operators' and low-price system operators' adjustment of their rates for inflation. ""Small operators"" are defined as those serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers and not affiliated with a larger operator. ""Low-price systems"" are defined as those systems that charge relatively low prices for regulated services under benchmark rates on March 31, 1994. The Ninth Order on Reconsideration allows small operators and low-price systems that have taken advantage of the transition relief to adjust their transition rates to reflect increases in inflation without any further delay. The Order provides that such operators may adjust their rates to reflect the net of inflation adjustments permitted to other operators, minus any inflation adjustments they have already received. The Order also provides that, in the future, small operators and low-price systems may make inflation adjustments in the same manner as other cable operators. In the Tenth Order on Reconsideration the Commission lessened the burden on particular operators when they request future rate adjustments. In the Second Reconsideration Order , the Commission relieved transition system operators of the obligation to track both their transition rates and full reduction rates on rate forms filed with the Commission. Transition systems fall into two categories -- systems with a total subscriber base of 15,000 or fewer customers and which are not affiliated with a larger operator, and systems whose March 31, 1994, rates are above the benchmark rate but have permitted rates at or below the benchmark. The formula for setting the benchmark rate was established in the Second Reconsideration Order . Although they were not required to reduce their rates to the benchmark, transition systems were not allowed to adjust their transition rates for inflation. To track differences in transition and full reduction rates, transition systems were required to report their current transition rates and rates that would apply if the full reducInflation Recovery (MM Docket 92-266)  Parallel Rate Tracking (MM Docket 92-266)   74  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  tion rate were imposed. In the Ninth Order on Reconsideration , however, the Commission authorized transition systems to adjust their transition rates for inflation thereby eliminating the underlying difference between adjustment factors for transition rates and adjustment factors for full reduction rates. Accordingly, the Commission, in the Tenth Order on Reconsideration, relieved transition operators of the burden of tracking both rates on rate forms. Home Shopping (MM Dockets 92-266 and 93-215)  In the Twelfth Order on Reconsideration the Commission eliminated regulatory disincentives for operators to provide home shopping services on their systems. The Commission deleted the requirement that operators offset the mark up for channel additions with sales commissions received from home shopping channels. The Commission's order applies only to per channel mark ups on the cable programming service tier and does not apply to license fees to the extent such fees are imposed. Because the Commission does not require offsets for value received from traditional programmers in the form of advertising availabilities, the Commission concluded that offset requirements for home shopping sales commissions had the effect of favoring one type of channel content over another. The home shopping sales commission offset had the effect of eliminating the mark up incentive to add a home shopping channel simply because cable subscribers responded in significant numbers to offerings on a shopping channel. On the other hand, traditional channels that allowed operators to earn revenue on advertising availabilities did not trigger a similar offset obligation for the operator. Accordingly, the Twelfth Order on Reconsideration was adopted to eliminate this disparity. In addition, the elimination of the offset requirement reduced accounting and adjustment burdens associated with the regular calculation of sales commission offsets. In FY95 the Commission adopted the Thirteenth Order on Reconsideration simplifying rules affecting cable operators' rates. The Order established a new optional rate adjustment methodology that encourages operators to limit their rate increases to once per year. This methodology limits delays in recovering costs that operators may experience under the current system. The Order also eliminated the practice of reviewing the entire cable programming service tier (CPST) rate after the Commission receives a complaint about CPST rates. In addition, the Order permits a CPST rate change to go into effect without wait ing for the Commission to approve it, unless the Commission rejects the proposed change within 30 days after the filing of the proposal.  Annual Rate Adjustments (MM Docket 92-26)   C  ABLE  TELEVISION B  UREAU  75  The Commission adopted two items in furtherance of its statutory obligation to ease the burdens of regulation for smaller cable systems. In the Sixth Report and Order and Eleventh Order on Reconsideration , the Commission expanded the definition of a ""small system,"" created a new category of cable operators known as ""small cable companies,"" and established a new method of rate regulation, based upon cost-of-service principles, for the exclusive use of small systems owned by small cable companies, as newly defined. In particular, the Commission determined that systems serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers would be deemed small systems and that operators serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers over all of their systems would constitute small cable companies. Small systems owned by small cable companies, as now defined, are eligible to elect the new small system cost-of-service relief, as well as other relief previously made available to certain smaller systems and operators. The new cost-of-service approach involves a very simple, five-element calculation based upon a system's costs. The calculation produces a per channel rate for regulated services that will be presumed reasonable if it is no higher than $1.24 per channel, although the requested rate remains subject to limited review by the local franchising authority or the Commission. If the formula generates a rate exceeding $1.24 per regulated channel, the operator still may charge that rate if it meets its burden of proving that the rate is reasonable. Adoption of this item resulted in the elimination of the prior categories of small systems, small operators, and small MSOs. In addition, the Commission determined that transition relief would no longer be available to systems that had not previously elected that form of rate regulation. Separately, as a result of the Eighth Order on Reconsideration , small systems owned by small cable companies may enter into alternative rate regulation agreements with certified local franchising authorities. Through these agreements, the parties negotiate directly with each other to determine reasonable rates for basic service and cable programming service tiers. The agreements also may include provisions relating to rate increases and network upgrades. The agreements do not have to be based on the Commission's standard rules or forms governing regulated rates, but must take into account the regulatory criteria of the 1992 Cable Act. These agreements ensure that participating systems will not be required to charge rates lower than would be permitted by the Commission's benchmark rules.  Small Systems (MM Dockets 92-266 and 93-215)   76  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Survey of Cable Industry Costs (MM Docket 92-266)  The Commission initiated a survey to determine cable industry average costs. The industry cost survey is needed to determine whether and to what extent ""low-price"" systems should be required to make further rate reductions. In its Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second Reconsideration Order ), the Commission provided special ""transition"" relief from the impact of reducing regulated rates by the full competitive differentials to low-price systems. Low-price systems are defined as those not subject to effective competition whose March 31, 1994, rates are above the benchmark rate but their permitted rates are at or below the benchmark. The order further indicated that transition relief would terminate upon completion of an industry cost survey. Accordingly, a cost survey was mailed to 660 cable systems requesting information regarding primary system costs and operations, including plant costs, intangibles, revenues, operating expenses and capitalization. The questionnaire also asks for information about employment and plant facility statistics. The Commission expects to analyze and publish the survey results during FY96. The 1992 Cable Act requires the Commission to publish an annual statistical report on the average rates for cable programming service and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment provided by cable systems. This report must compare the rates charged by cable systems that are subject to effective competition with those not subject to effective competition. To obtain information for the required comparisons, the Bureau mailed survey questionnaires to a targeted group of cable communities known to face effective competition and to a randomly selected group of cable communities not subject to effective competition. The survey sought information concerning rates for basic and cable programming services, and equipment used to receive such services. The survey also requested that cable operators provide data for three dates: August 31, 1993, the effective date of the initial rate regulation rules; July 14, 1994, following the effective date of the revised benchmark rules and the end of the refund deferral period; and January 1, 1995, the beginning of the most recent annual period. The Bureau expects to analyze and publish a statistical report based on the survey responses during FY96. The Commission released its Second Annual Report to Congress on the status of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming. This Congressionally-mandated report provides information that summarizes the status of competition in the video marketplace and updates the information provided in the Commission's first annual report released in 1994. The Commission's major findings were:  Annual Report on Average Rates for Cable Programming Service and Equipment (MM Docket 92-266)  Competition in the Video Programming Delivery Market (CS Docket 95-61)   C  ABLE  TELEVISION B  UREAU  77   For the cable industry, subscriber penetration, average system channel capacity, the number of programming services available, revenues, expenditures on programming, and capital investment generally have increased since 1994;  Although the percentage of subscribers choosing competitive alternatives to incumbent cable operators has increased since the 1994 report, cable subscribership continues to dwarf the combined subscribership of all other multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs);  Since 1994, there has been increased horizontal concentration of cable multiple system operators (MSOs) nationwide and increased regional ""clustering"" of cable system ownership. Local markets for the distribution of multichannel video programming tend to be highly concentrated as measured by subscribership among all MVPDs;  While the number of cable programming services has increased over the past year, the percentage of services that are vertically integrated with cable operators has declined slightly; and  Technological advances are occurring that will permit MVPDs to increase the number of channels offered and the types of service offerings. However, it is unclear whether existing cable operators or their existing and potential competitors will benefit most from these technological advances.   78  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  79  Office Of Engineering And Technology  Developing the radio frequency spectrum into a usable national resource for public and private use is a primary FCC function. The FCC, through its Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), does this by balancing spectrum demands among competitors and promulgating ""rules of the road"" to maximize spectrum usefulne ss. During the past fiscal year OET took the goals of Reinventing Government seriously. It created a new streamlined structure to assess more efficiently current and future technical and engineering spectrum needs. Under the new OET, investigation, analysis and planning for future spectrum uses are more quickly accomplished utilizing the engineering, technical, policy and economic expertise among its interdisciplinary staff members. The staff provides swifter analysis of spectrum options; formulates solutions to spectrum management concerns; designs spectrum charts, maps and models; promotes collaborative policy and technical issues development; and applies more innovative, forward-thinking approaches to new challenges before the Commission. Important rulemakings such as the allocation of new spectrum for millimeter wave activities and digital audio radio services have evolved from OET technical work. This past year, OET identified spectrum that can be converted from the Government to the private sector, or that can be made available for sharing among several technologies. OET recommended the use of 25 megahertz at 4.6 GHz for fixed and mobile services that could eventually support a wide variety of innovative applications, such as live ground-to-air distribution of television programming, digital broadcast auxiliary operations, and public safety video communications. OET examined important issues which affect our disabled population such as the problem of compatibility between proposed Personal Communications Services (PCS) and wireless services and telephone and hearing aids. OET's streamlining the steps for granting experimental licenses and equipment authorizations has resulted in new types of equipment entering the market-  Overview   80  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  place. Other activities in FY95 included recommending several major frequency allocation actions to advance communications services to the public in the years to come; identifying spectrum that can be converted from the Gov ernment to the private sector; undertaking specialized projects; providing technical support to other bureaus, such as the development of PCS propagation maps; redesigning spectrum to allow for expanded uses, such as for emerging technologies; authorizing equipment and issuing experimental licenses for new technologies and services; working with other Government agencies on special communications requirements and agreements; and attending important international meetings. The OET Technical Information Library responded to numerous requests for information and various technical documents, in addition to filling hundreds of inhouse requests for assistance. Part of the educational effort includes the production of telecommunications reports, special studies, informative publications, and OET is customerfact sheets on a variety of technical and regulatory activities.

OET had over 60,000 interactions with the public in FY95. The Office produces telecommunications reports, special studies and Fact Sheets on a variety of technical and regulatory activities. Informative publications are prepared to keep the public apprised of recent developments. For example, OET responded to more than 1600 inquiries during the year just concerning the safety of radiofrequency fields, safety standards and environmental effects. OET staff also serve on various industry, Government and international committees and task forces in order to lend expertise in particular areas of telecommunications, engineering and spectrum management concerns. OET's technical and computer staffs have improved the ability of the public to access important spectrum management information. Outreach activities, especially those of a time-sensitive nature, are also provided electronically. OET has created a database to track OET rulemaking and maintains the Worldwide Web, OET Homepage, and email address. The site, Homepage and email address have drastically increased the public's access to OET by providing an easy route to important information concerning the Office and its activities. For example, the Homepage includes a ""hot topics"" list, a ""frequently asked questions"" list and information on OET divisions. Our email address is OET@fcc.gov and our site is www.fcc.gov.   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  81  The Public Access Link (PAL) provides computerized information on the status of pending applications, limited technical information on granted authorizations, and other information related to equipment authorization that is of interest to the public. The system remains on-line continuously, providing a twenty-four hour service to the public. Use of the PAL system is approximately 3,700 calls and 8,000 ID accesses monthly. During FY95 OET staff presented a series of tutorials to the FCC staff and the public concerning technology developments. These included tutorials on ""The Global Positioning System,"" ""Millimeter Waves,"" and ""Software Radio Basics.""  FY95 Highlights  Launched an investigation of potential interference from PCS handheld devices to hearing aids.  In the areas of radio technology, recommended the allocation of 50 megahertz of spectrum in the 2.3 GHz band for satellite digital audio radio broadcasting.  Following a growing commercial interest in the integration of services, recommended the allocation of 10 megahertz of spectrum at 2.4 GHz for unlicensed personal computer devices to support data transmission.  Recommended the allocation of 70 megahertz of spectrum in the 2 GHz range for future mobile-satellite systems and additional allocation for amateurs at 219 MHz.  Granted nearly a thousand experimental licenses to diverse entities. These licenses aided in identifying what new services and technologies were under development and in what parts of the spectrum.  An emphasis on less burdensome procedures for equipment authorization and refinements to the application process has almost eliminated the ""type approval"" step in which the proposed equipment had to be submitted to the OET Lab. As a result, more than 7,000 applications for equipment authorization were processed this year including PCS licensed and unlicensed equipment.   82  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT   Examined how best to allot additional channels from the allocated television spectrum for Digital Television. Studies are being conducted to minimize the impact on current television during the transition to digital television. After the transition period, some spectrum might be recovered to support future communications services.  Refined radio propagation prediction methods which will be useful in assessing the impact of PCS on the current spectrum users and on stations in Canada operating close to our borders.  Worked toward deregulating digital devices by replacing current requirements for personal computers and peripherals. This would allow manufacturer selfdeclaration of conformity with radio interference standards and increase the speed of computer products to the market.  Major Proceedings Pioneer's Preference Rules (ET Docket 93-266)  As a result of a series of modifications to the pioneer's preference program made in FY95, the rules now provide that any licenses awarded pursuant to the program in services in which competitive bidding is used are subject to a payment of 85 percent of the average price paid for comparable licenses. The rules also specify a termination date for the pioneer's preference program of September 30, 1998. On January 30, 1995, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making that proposed to allocate the 1990-2025 MHz (Earth-to-space) and 21652200 MHz (space-to-Earth) bands to the mobile-satellite service (MSS). The Commission proposed to allocate the bands for both geostationary (GSO) and low-Earth orbit (LEO) use, but solicited comment on whether limiting the bands to one type of use would be preferable. The Commission stated that the proposed allocation would create opportunities to provide new and competitive services and technologies to the public, particularly in rural areas; stimulate economic development; and create new high technology jobs.  Mobile-Satellite Service at 2 GHz (ET Docket 95-18)   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  83  On June 26, 1995, the Commission adopted a Second Report and Order which reallocated the 1525-1530 MHz band to the mobile-satellite service on a primary basis for space-to-Earth (downlink) transmissions. This action was aimed at increasing the efficiency of MSS operations by equalizing the amount of spectrum available in the uplink and downlink segments. The action implemented a WARC-92 spectrum allocation and facilitated international coordination for use of this spectrum. On January 12, 1995, the Commission adopted a Report and Order in Docket 90-357 allocating spectrum in the 2310-2360 MHz band for satellite digital audio radio services (DARS). This action was consistent with the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference, which allocated the band to the United States for the broadcast satellite service. The Commission said that the allocation was the first step toward providing the American public with new multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services with sound quality equivalent to compact disks on a nationwide or regional basis. On June 14 1995, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in Docket 95-91, proposing service and licensing rules for satellite DARS. On April 5, 1995, the Commission adopted a Report and Order, making 15 new channel pairs available for cordless telephone use. The new channels offer several advantages over other alternative frequency bands. First, the close proximity of the new channels to existing frequencies will enable continued use of existing technology. As a result, the cost of products using the new channels will not increase significantly. Second, cordless telephones using the new channels will be able to make use of the ten originally authorized channels to offer 25-channel capability. Third, the risk of the new channels' causing interference to other services is low. Cordless telephones operating on the new frequencies will deliver improved service at an affordable cost. In addition, consumers may choose among cordless telephones operating in other frequency bands that ffer different performance levels at higher costs. On October 20, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making, proposing for use by non-Government fixed and mobile services 50 megahertz of transferred Federal Government spectrum at 2390-2400, 24022417, and 4660-4685 MHz. On February 7, 1995, in a First Report and Order and Second Notice of Proposed Rule Making , the Commission allocated the 2390-2400 MHz band for use by unlicensed PCS devices, provided for continued use of the 2402-2417 MHz band by low-power devices operating in accordance with Part 15 of the Commission's rules, allocated both of these bands for use by the Amateur radio service on a primary basis, and proposed to allocate the 4660-4685 MHz band to a General Wireless Communications Service (GWCS). On July 31, 1995, in a Second Report and Order, the Commission adopted the GWCS allocation and service rules.  Mobile-Satellite Service at 1530-1544 & 1626.51645.5 MHz (GEN Docket 90-56)  Digital Audio Radio Services (GEN Docket 90-357, IB Docket 95-91)  Cordless Telephones (ET Docket 93-235)  Transfer of Government Spectrum (ET Docket 94-32)   84  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Amateur Radio Service (ET Docket 93-40)  On March 14, 1995, the Commission adopted a Report and Order that allocated the 219-220 MHz band to the Amateur radio service on a secondary basis for fixed digital message forwarding systems. This allocation will facilitate the regional and nationwide provision of a packet data network. The additional Amateur allocation was necessary because of congestion in the 222225 MHz Amateur band. On July 25, 1995, the Commission adopted an Order deleting a requirement that television receivers manufactured after January 1, 1995, incorporate closedcaption decoder circuitry that is compatible with a cable television copy protection system manufactured by the Eidak Corporation. This action relieved electronics manufacturers of the burden of incorporating special circuitry in television receivers for a technology that is not used by cable systems. On March 14, 1995, the Commission permitted the temporary assignment of frequencies in the 482-488 MHz band (television Channel 16) to public safety agencies in the New York City metropolitan area. Public safety use of these frequencies will be permitted for a period of at least five years or until the Commission assigns Channel 16 in New York City for advanced television service (ATV) and the television licensee begins to utilize Channel 16 for ATV operations. The Commission granted the waiver to provide public safety agencies with immediate spectrum relief that is urgently needed in the congested New York City metropolitan area.  Closed Caption Decoder Circuitry (GEN Docket 91-1)  New York Waiver (FCC 95-115)  Technical Activities  OET's technical and engineering studies in FY95 reflected the movement toward more advanced technologies. OET created a model for propagation predictions and associated criteria for coordination of PCS with existing microwave stations. This model has become the definitive guide to industry in the introduction of PCS into the existing microwave environment. OET launched an investigation of potential interference from PCS handheld devices to hearing aids. Using state-of-the-art operations research, OET developed computer models capable of evaluating proposed HDTV channel allotment tables. OET completed an empirical study in support of the ATV advisory committee dealing with short-term propagation variability of UHF television signals. OET directed an FCC/Environmental Agency field measurement study of cellular radio and paging facilities and produced a study on radio frequency fields from amateur radio facilities to determine the potential for these sites to pose a health hazard. The Office also studied the potential for interference from   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  85  proposed new cordless telephone frequencies in support of rule making establishing new channels. In promoting efficient use of the spectrum, OET conducted spectrum usage studies in the 38.6-40 GHz band and in the 6 GHz band, as well as conducting surveys of equipment availability. It also performed a technical analysis of the 1990-2110 MHz Auxiliary Broadcast Band to determine the feasibility of sharing with mobile satellite operations and to determine potential for relocating Broadcasting Auxiliary Services. OET provided analyses of existing spectrum utilization in the 800 MHz private radio bands, assessments of technical developments that could increase the channel capacity of current public safety spectrum, and studies of spectrum that might become available for future public safety use.  This year models that were developed from situations in which transmitters in the new personal communications systems might cause interference to existing microwave systems were refined and incorporated into industry standards. In support of various Commission proceedings, OET carried out a number of propagation studies to define service and interference potential in the microwave, land mobile, and broadcasting services, including the evaluation of a number of applications and waiver requests involving the effects of terrain and meteorological conditions on propagation. Also, OET continued participation in an international program which provides median frequency skywave data from around the world. These data are being analyzed and compared with various prediction models as part of the preparation for an ITU Conference on LF/MF broadcasting planned for 1998/1999. A technical paper describing daytime skywave propagation has been prepared for presentation at this conference, and a version of this paper was published in the IEEE, ""Transactions on Broadcasting."" During FY95 the staff performed analyses to identify frequency bands for emerging technologies and studied the current use and users of the 6 GHz band to evaluate the band's suitability for new technologies. OET also developed numerous maps and studies in support of rulemaking action in several regulated services such as land mobile, point-to-point microwave, cellular, marine radio services, the digital audio radio service in the 2.3 GHz band and maps of the 931 MHz paging stations along the Mexican and Canadian borders for use in international negotiations. Telecommunications Analysis Propagation Analysis   86  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Engineering Evaluation  FY95 activities included an investigation of potential interference from PCS to hearing aids; measurements of interference immunities of television receivers to signals on proposed new cordless telephone frequencies; investigations of alternative radiated emissions measurement technologies; participation in the development of measurement procedures for unlicensed PCS; development of revised measurement procedures for unlicensed spread spectrum radios; assessment of rationality of existing emission limits below 30 MHz; study of the requirement for, and alternatives to, construction of an enclosed test site for the FCC Lab; and oversight of DAR system development and testing. Support was also provided to the advanced television standards development effort in the form of development and evaluation of channel allocation models, as well as technical oversight and expert observation of ATV laboratory and field testing. OET is responsible for advising the Commission, the public, and industry on matters relating to potential hazards of environmental radiofrequency radiation, and with respect to implementation of RF radiation standards under Section 1.1307(b) of the Commission's Rules. In that regard, several hundred inquiries concerning this issue were handled by OET staff. Inquiries included telephone calls, letters, and Congressional inquiries. In addition, numerous investigations and evaluations were made by OET staff relating to specific transmitters regulated by the Commission. These evaluations were made for other bureaus as well as in response to requests made directly to OET by outside organizations, members of the public, and other federal, state and local agencies. Transmitters involved included broadcast stations, cellular radio facilities and transmitters, amateur radio stations, land-mobile facilities, and satellite uplink base stations.  Radiofrequency (RF) Radiation  Authorization, Experimental Activities Experimental Radio Service  The Experimental Radio Service Program examines new spectrum uses that will accommodate myriad technological services in the future. It permits the public to experiment with new uses of radio frequencies. This past year it assisted industry by granting experimental licenses and has been able to reduce significantly the application processing time. During FY95, 742 applications for radio research and developmental projects were granted. In addition, 333 requests for special temporary authority were authorized. Federal contracts for developing radio equipment and exploring   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  87  new radio techniques made up a considerable portion of the authorizations issued. At the close of the fiscal year, 1,055 experimental stations were in operation, and 139 stations were operating under special temporary authority. The equipment authorization program includes several specific procedures by which the agency approves radio equipment as a prerequisite to importat ion, marketing or use. An emphasis on less burdensome procedures for equipment authorization and refinement to the application process has almost eliminated the ""type approval"" step in which the proposed equipment had to be submitted to the program. As a result, nearly 7,000 applications for equipment authorization were processed in FY95, including the first licensed and unlicensed PCS equipment. Equipment Authorization  Post-Grant Sampling OET also tests production units marketed to the public after the initial equipment authorization grant has been issued. The Commission uses the results of these tests to evaluate the certification, verification, and notification pro- grams; to take action in cases of non-compliance with FCC rules; to confirm initial estimates of the interference potential of new devices; to support rule making actions; to verify test data provided by manufacturers in support of equipment authorization applications; and to monitor the results of tests by independent laboratories. In FY95 a number of miscellaneous devices suspected of non-compliance based on marketing investigations or interference complaints were tested, including RF light bulbs, baby monitors, 49 MHz cordless telephones, 900 MHz cordless telephones (both narrowband and spread spectrum), remote control transmitters, personal computers and peripherals, FAX machines, walkie talkies, an electronic cash register, and an ultrasonic cleaner. To ensure manufacturers' compliance with Commission procedures and standards, OET continued a program to review descriptions of test facilities, as required by the rules. All test sites were reviewed on a timely basis, and a list of the test facilities that were acceptable was maintained as a public document, and on the Public Access Link (PAL) information system. OET prepared technical information detailing the consequences for PCS use near the U.S./Canadian border that was influential in gaining Canadian Government concurrence with FCC actions creating PCS.   88  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  International Activities  OET staff participated in the negotiations with the United States Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce to develop a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with the European Union (EU) for Conformity Assessment. OET participated in three separate sets of meetings with the EU in FY 95. The purpose of the MRA is to facilitate trade by harmonizing and possibly streamlining the conformity assessment procedures between the USA and the EU. The equipment under consideration for the MRA is information technology and telephone terminal equipment. Additional negotiations will continue into FY 96. Any changes to the FCC equipment authorization program, as a result of a MRA, would be accomplished through rulemaking.  Commmittee and OET staff also serves on various industry, Government and international commitCoordination Group tees and tasks forces in order to lend expertise in particular areas of telecommuniActivities cations, engineering and spectrum management concerns.  OET staff participated in the Information Infrastructure Standards Panel, an ANSI organization created to identify areas where standards are needed to facilitate development of a national and global information infrastructure and to identify any existing standards that can be used to fulfill these needs. OET also participated in meeting of the Interagency Committee for Standards Policy, a high level committee to provide consistency and direction in development and use of standards in the Federal Government. OET is also a member of the American National Standards Institute and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. OET staff participated in meetings and made presentations to various industry groups, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the FCC's Advanced Television Advisory Committee, and the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). ITU Radiocommunication (ITU-R) Study Group Activities  OET staff remain active in the work of the ITU. OET was an active participant in the work of Study Group 3 of ITU-R, which studies Radio Wave Propagation matters. An OET staff member authorized a chapter on LF/MF propagation to be incorporated into the draft Ionospheric Propagation Handbook and participated in the U.S. National Committee, as a member of the Home Team, deliberating U.S. national positions for the 1996 Plenary Assembly and the World Radio Conference. OET staff participated in the ITU-R Working Party 8A dealing with issues pertaining to the land mobile service, including the PCS. Additionally, OET staff drafted material for ITU-R Study Group 1 to provide countries information on spectrum planning and management and attended meetings of the U.S. group for ITU-R 10/11S and ITU-R Working Party 8D.   O  FFICE AND  ENGINEERING  AND  TECHNOLOGY  89  In support of the ITU the ITU-R Working Party 3K, OET conducted an analytical study of skywave propagation during daytime. OET also conducted an evaluation of the GTEM measurement cell, resulting in a liberalization of policies regarding use of the cell for radiated emission compliance measurements. An OET staff member also acts as the U.S. Representative to the ITU-R Task Group 8/1 on future public land mobile telecommunications systems. The high-profile ITU activity is geared towards creating worldwide personal communications services beginning in the year 2000.  The Radio Technical Liaison Committee (RTLC) is a group of high level spectrum managers from the FCC and the Canadian Department of Communications which meets regularly to discuss matters of mutual concern involving spectrum use and technical standards. OET's Deputy Chief is the Co-Chairman of this committee. Discussions this past year focused on mobile communications systems operating along the border, on the issue of reviewing existing bilateral agreements, and on equipment authorization processes. OET staff participated in meetings of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC), serving as experts on U.S. technical standards. CISPR activities include participation in meetings of the U.S. National Committee (USNC) Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for developing positions to CISPR Subcommittee A for instrumentation and measurement methods; the USNC TAG for CISPR Subcommittee B for controlling the interference potential of ISM equipment; the USNC TAG for CISPR Subcommittee E for limiting and measuring the interference characteristics of broadcast receivers and associated equipment; the USNC TAG for CISPR Subcommittee F for limiting and measuring the interference characteristics of home appliances and lighting devices; the USNC TAG for CISPR Subcommittee G for determining the interference lim its and test procedures for ITE; and the Advisory Group for the USNC for the CISPR. OET staff also participated in several CISPR ad hoc meetings for limits and measurements of emissions on frequencies above 1 GHz. The results of these meetings will determine the procedures for protecting the new digital radio services (i.e., Personal Communications Service) above 1 GHz. OET staff represented the FCC on the Standards Board of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American National Standards Institute, and the National Committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission, all of which form a link between national and international, voluntary and regulatory standards activities. OET staff also represented the FCC on  Radio Technical Liaison Committee Activities   90  FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  the American National Standards Committee, C63, on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Many of the voluntary industry standards developed by C63 have been incorporated into the FCC Rules, particularly in the area of measurement methodology.   O  FFICE OF  PLANS  AND  POLICY 91  Office of Plans and Policy  The Office of Plans and Policy (OPP) serves as the principal economic, technical, and policy adviser to the Commission, analyzing agenda items and developing long term policy. The office also produces working papers on major policy issues. The continuing focus of OPP's work during FY95 was to encourage economic growth; enhance access to telecommunications service offerings for consumers, producers, and new entrants; support the creation of new services; and promote market-oriented approaches to spectrum management.  Overview  FY95 Highlights  OPP put in place the auction mechanism that led to the largest auction, public or private, in history. The auction of Broadband Personal Communications Services licenses generated over $7.7 billion for the U.S. Treasury in FY95.  Vice President Al Gore presented the Hammer award for reinventing government to several OPP staff for their accomplishments in the Personal Communications Services (PCS) auctions. The FCC further awarded Evan Kwerel of OPP a gold medal award for distinguished service for his contributions to the auction design and implementation. For his role in the auctions, Jonathan Cohen was featured as the ""Dealmaker of the Month"" in the May 1995 issue of American Lawyer Magazine.  OPP staff presented papers and speeches at numerous industry and academic conferences, both domestic and international, and published articles in Journals and professional publications.  OPP spearheaded the recruitment and hiring of 39 economists throughout the Commission, recognizing the importance of expanded economic analysis in telecommunications policymaking.  During FY95 OPP participated in the Commission's interdisciplinary task forces implementing Personal Communications Services; Equipment Compatibility; and Spectrum Auctions.   92 FEDERAL C  OMMUNICATIONS  C  OMMISSION  A  NNUAL  R  EPORT  Major Proceedings PCS and Spectrum Auctions  Personal Communications Services (PCS) are a broad family of mobile and portable communications services that are widely predicted to usher in an era of mobile telecommunications technology that will permit access to an array of voice, data, and video communications services regardless of where a subscriber may be located. Equipment being developed for PCS includes small, lightweight wireless telephone handsets; computers that can communicate over the airwaves wherever they are located; portable facsimile machines and other graphic devices. OPP staff worked to craft policy in the PCS arena to ensure that there is a robust and competitive market for PCS services; foster the diversity of PCS service offerings; permit broad participation in the provision of PCS, including participation by existing cellular providers; and to consider special opportunities for participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women. OPP, which first proposed auctions in 1986, was responsible for managing the process implementing spectrum auctions and had principal authorship of several documents that set forth PCS service rules, general spectrum auction rules and specific rules for each service to be auctioned. As a part of the PCS Task Force, OPP began planning for the auction of broadband licenses to provide Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (broadband PCS). This set the stage for the largest and most important auction of public assets to date. The first auction of 30 MHz licenses in each of 99 Major Trading Areas began on December 5, 1995, and ended on March 13, 1995. The auction generated a total of $7.7 billion in high bids. In an effort to facilitate the development and rapid deployment of wireless cable services, the Commission adopted rules to auction 493 licenses for Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS). OPP was involved in the planning and design of the service and auction rules. The MDS auction began on November 19, 1995. OPP has long championed the Commission's effort to continually evaluate spectrum use in an effort to allocate it in an efficient manner. To accomplish this goal, OPP has been involved in a number of spectrum allocation proceedings to promote efficiency of allocation and flexibility of use. OPP staff worked closely with the Office of Engineering and Technology, the International Bureau, and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to craft spectrum management policies that will make best use of this valuable public resource.

Among its functions it informs the Congress of the Commission's regulatory decisions, prepares Commission witnesses for Congressional hearings, facilitates responses to Congressional inquiries, and prepares Commission responses to legislative proposals. In addition, the Office acts on FCC policies and acts as liaison to other Federal, state and local government agencies. During FY95 the Congress enacted four laws affecting, or of interest to, the Commission. These included legislation extending and amending the Satellite Home Viewer Act, recognizing the achievements of radio amateurs, clarifying a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for law enforcement purposes, and implementing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as it relates to the FCC's ""pioneer preference"" program. A more detailed listing follows: 1. PL 103-369 (S.2406): ""Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994."" Extended the statutory copyright license for home satellite viewers until December 31,1999. Established signal intensity measurement procedures to determine whether a subscriber is an ""unserved household."" Amended the definition of ""cable system"" to include wireless video retransmissions, and redefined a ""local service area of a primary transmitter"" to include a primary transmitter's local television market. This bill was signed into law on October 18, 1994. 2. PL 103-408 (S.J.Res. 90): A joint House-Senate resolution to recognize the achievements of radio amateurs, and to establish support for such amateurs as national policy. Recognized contributions of amateur radio operators and encouraged FCC to adopt policies to facilitate new technologies in amateur radio communications. This joint resolution was signed into law on October 22, 1994. 3. PL 103-414 (H.R. 4922): ""Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act."" Clarified a telecommunications carrier's duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for law enforcement purposes. Expanded the privacy and  Enacted Laws   OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS  95  security protections of cellular and other radio-based communications. Required the Attorney General to make payments to telecommunications carriers to comply with the bill's requirements. Required the FCC to determine whether or not compliance by specific carriers is ""reasonably achievable."" This bill was signed into law on October 25, 1994. 4. PL 103-465 (H.R. 5110): An amendment to a bill to approve and implement the trade agreements concluded in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations, otherwise known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Required the FCC to recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum that has been awarded by the Commission to licenses granted under the FCC's ""pioneer preference"" program. Required the three pioneers to date to pay not less than 85 percent, on a per population basis, of the highest auction bids for licenses in the 20 largest markets in which no applicant has obtained preferential treatment. This bill was signed into law on December 8, 1994. In May 1995 the Commission submitted to the Congress a legislative package consisting of 37 proposals. Nearly all of these proposals were deregulatory or pro-competitive in nature in that their enactment would eliminate certain Commission functions, privatize other responsibilities, reduce regulatory burdens on industry, increase telecommunications competition, save agency resources, or otherwise streamline agency processes. Among the FCC's 37 legislative proposals were amendments granting the FCC more flexibility in the administration of its application and regulatory fee programs, delicensing aviation, maritime and personal radio services, privatizing the inspection of ship radio stations, and expediting the processing of applications for Instructional Television Fixed Service. (Twenty-one of the FCC's 37 1995 legislative proposals were eventually included in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, PL 104-104, to be reported on in more detail in the FCC Annual Report for FY96.) 1. Coordinated the preparation of testimony, briefing material, and responses to follow-up questions for a number of Congressional hearings on such matters as electromagnetic interference to medical devices, the FCC's ""pioneer preference"" program, and implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the FCC tax certificate policy and program, Inspector General recommendations for ways to obtain budgetary savings and spending reductions, alien ownership, cable rate deregulation, FY96 appropriations, regulatory sunset legislation, FCC reauthorization, consolidation of the FCC headquarters locations, and cellular resellers.  Legislative Program  Other Legislative Activities   96  FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT  2. Monitored and reported on hearings, bill mark-ups, and floor action of interest to the Commission on such matters as FY96 appropriations, telecommunications reform legislation, TV violence, spectrum allocation and assignment policies, competitive bidding authority, the FCC tax certificate policy and program, regulatory reform legislation, alien ownership, FCC reauthorization, abolition of the Department of Commerce, and the budget reconciliation process and related legislation. 3. Coordinated and participated in informational briefings of Members of Congress and Congressional staff on a wide variety of mass media and telecommunications issues. 4. Prepared both formal and informal comments for both the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget on pending communications legislation. 5. Coordinated extensive Congressional liaison activities. Processed 5,862 written Congressional inquiries, and approximately 12,000 telephone inquiries on a variety of matters, especially implementation of the Cable Act of 1992, spectrum auctions authority, other policy matters, and the status of applications for frequencies, construction or modification of facilities, and special temporary authority.   LITGATION  97  Litigation The Commission participated in approximately 310 federal appeals and Supreme Court proceedings during FY95. At the end of the fiscal year, 120 appellate and Supreme Court cases were pending. In addition, during the fiscal year, the Commission participated in approximately 84 federal district court cases. At the end of the fiscal year, 47 district court cases were pending.  Decisions of Special Interest Action for Children's Television v. FCC , No. 93-1092, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. denied , U.S. (1996). The Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 16(a) of the Public Telecommunications Act of 1992 (47 U.S.C. 303a), which seeks to shield minors from indecent radio and television programs by restricting hours within which stations may air such programs. By a 7-4 majority, the full Court held that the government had a compelling interest in protecting children from broadcast indecency and that ""channelling"" broadcasts of indecent material to the hours of 10 pm to 6 am would not unduly burden First Amendment rights of broadcasters or of adult viewers and listeners. American Scholastic TV Programming Foundation v. FCC , No. 93-1652, 46 F.3d 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Section 533(b) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 forbids common carriers from ""provid[ing] video programming"" to subscribers within the common carrier's service area. The D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC's ruling that the video programming prohibition of Section 533(b) applies only to video programming provided over cable television systems and not to video programming supplied by ""wireless cable"" systems, which use radio signals rather than physical wires to transport their signals. The court accordingly rejected a challenge to the FCC's award of a license to provide educational television via wireless cable to a company affiliated with a local telephone company in Roanoke, Virginia. The court also rejected as improperly raised a challenge to the FCC's ruling that wireless cable systems are not cable systems within the meaning of the Cable Act because they do not utilize a ""closed path"" to transport their signals, as required by the Act.   98 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT  Committee for Effective Cellular Rules v. FCC , No. 93-1220, 53 F.3d 1309 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The Court affirmed an order amending the FCC's cellular rules to provide new standards and procedures governing applications for unserved areas. The order, inter alia, modified the definition of a Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) in a way that effectively increased the protected reliable service area of most incumbent licensees, thereby diminishing the areas available to applicants for unserved areas. The Court held that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when it amended its regulations through notice and comment rulemaking; nor did it exceed its statutory authority when it implemented a global change to the technical requirements for cellular licenses, even though the change resulted in the modification of virtually all existing cellular licenses and significantly reduced the unserved areas that potential applicants previously anticipated would be available to them for licensing. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC , No. 93-1166, 59 F.3d 1407 (D.C. Cir. 1995), petition for writ of certiorari pending sub nom ., BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. v. FCC, et al ., No. 95-1230. In this case, the Commission adjudicated hundreds of individual complaints filed by customers of the local exchange carriers (LECs) seeking damages because the rates they had paid for interstate access service had produced earnings in excess of the maximum rate of return the Commission had prescribed. The Commission found that virtually all the customers showed that the LECs were liable for damages because the LECs had violated the rate of return prescriptions and Section 201 of the Act. The Commission allowed offsets to the damages awards to the extent that the customer had purchased service in other interstate access categories from the LECs during the same periods at the rates that had produced underearnings. The Court affirmed the damages awards, but found that the offsets were arbitrary and capricious. Southwestern Bell Corp. v. FCC , No. 93-1562, 43 F.3d 1515 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's rulemaking decision to allow non-dominant carriers to file tariffs identifying a range of rates within which customers would pay for service rather than fixed, precise rates. The Court held that Section 203 requires carriers to identify the precise rates they will charge in their tariffs and that the Commission had no authority to change this fundamental aspect of rate regulation. The Commission had adopted the range of rates rules after its more liberal policy of allowing non-dominant carriers to offer service without tariffs had been set aside in the Supreme Court.   LITGATION  99  SBC Communications Inc. v. FCC , No. 94-1637, 56 F.3d 1484 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission's approval of AT&T's acquisition of McCaw, the largest cellular company in the country. The Court held that the Commission had properly considered the public interest ramifications of the merger, including its potential effects on competition, and had adequately explained its conclusions. The Court also held that the conditions the FCC had placed on the merger were reasonable and adequate to address appropriate policy concerns.  Time Warner Entertainment Co., L.P. v. FCC , No. 93-1723, 56 F.3d 151 (D.C. Cir. 1995), petitions for writ of certiorari pending sub nom ., Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. v. FCC & USA , No. 95-774 and National Cable Television Association, Inc. v. FCC & USA , No. 95-775. The D.C. Circuit denied in principal part consolidated challenges by the cable industry and local franchising authorities to the FCC's first five major rulemaking orders implementing the cable rate regulation provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. The orders on review, among other things, (1) established cable ratemaking standards that resulted in substantial rate reductions by most cable operators that are not subject to effective competition, (2) established certification standards and administrative review procedures for local franchising authorities charged under the 1992 Cable Act with regulating the ""basic"" cable service rates of most cable operators, and (3) established procedures for adjudicating at the FCC consumer complaints regarding the rates charges for ""upper tier"" cable programming services. The court rejected claims by the cable industry petitioners that the rate regulation rules violated their first amendment rights as speakers. The court also rejected, in most respects, opposing statutory and administrative law challenges to the rules from both the cable petitioners (on one side) and local franchising authorities (on the other) .

BTCCT-19991116ABA, et al.  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Adopted: May 3, 2000 Released: May 3, 2000  Before the Commission: Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth concurring in part, dissenting in part and issuing a separate statement; Commissioner Tristani approving in part, dissenting in part and issuing a separate statement. 1. The Commission has before it for consideration the applications to transfer control of the CBS Corporation (""CBS"") and its various licensee subsidiaries to Viacom, Inc. (""Viacom"").1 Petitions to deny the applications were filed by the American Cable Association (""ACA""), the National Black Media Coalition (""NBMC""), the WEYS Television Corporation (""WEYS""), and a group of petitioners objecting to certain broadcasts made by Howard Stern (""the Stern Petitioners"").2 In addition, the A.H. Belo Corporation (""Belo"") filed a letter opposing the applications after the petition to deny period had expired.3 We will exercise our discretion pursuant to 1.41 and treat the letter as an informal objection. For the reasons stated below, we deny the petitions and informal objection and grant the applications subject to 1 2  A complete list of the applications filed and the licenses to be transferred is attached as Exhibit A.  CBS and Viacom argued that the various petitioners do not have standing. However, we have reviewed the petitions and will address the arguments raised in them. In addition to the petitioners to deny, a number of individuals filed letters commenting on the proceeding. Those letters have been reviewed and considered in reaching our decision here. CBS and Viacom served their oppositions on the petitioners by facsimile, relying on 1.4(h) of our rules. We wish to clarify that 1.47, not 1.4(h), governs service requirements in Commission proceedings. See 47 C.F.R.  1.47. The reference in 1.4 as to how to treat service by facsimile or electronic mail only relates to timing issues that arise when such service is specifically authorized by our rules. It is not a blanket authorization of service by such means. In this proceeding, no party objected or claimed any prejudice due to the method of service, so we do not need to rule on the propriety of the service in this particular case. 3   Federal Communications Commission conditions to ensure compliance with our multiple ownership and cross-ownership rules. I. INTRODUCTION 4  2. On November 16, 1999, CBS and Viacom filed applications seeking Commission consent to the transfer of control of CBS and its subsidiary companies which are the licensees or permittees of numerous broadcast stations. CBS and its subsidiaries hold the licenses or construction permits of 20 television stations and 162 radio stations, in addition to various broadcast translator and auxiliary licenses. Viacom is the direct and indirect licensee or permittee of 18 television stations and several translator stations.5 Viacom is a publicly traded corporation that is currently controlled by National Amusements, Inc. (""NAI""), a single majority shareholder. Sumner Redstone controls NAI through the Sumner M. Redstone Trust.6 3. The applicants have made showings to support their contention that the proposed merger will fully comply with our radio and television duopoly rules. They have also made showings regarding those markets where the combined entity would own radio and television stations in excess of the permissible limits set out by our cross-ownership rule. In those markets, the applicants have requested time to come into compliance with that rule. Because the merger would result in violations of our Dual Network Rule and the national television ownership limit, the applicants have also requested time to bring the combined entity into compliance with those rules. Finally, the applicants have sought continued satellite waivers for certain television stations. The petitioners to deny oppose allowing the applicants time to come into compliance with our Dual Network Rule and the national ownership cap. NBMC makes additional allegations regarding EEO and news distortion violations by CBS. The Stern Petitioners allege that certain broadcasts of the Howard Stern program violated the laws governing indecent or obscene broadcasts. II. The Transaction 4. Viacom currently has two classes of publicly traded common stock, Class A (voting) and Class B (non-voting). The merger agreement calls for CBS shareholders to receive 1.085 shares of Viacom Class B stock for each share of CBS common stock. There will be no change in the ownership of Viacom Class A stock and ultimate control of Viacom will remain with Mr. Redstone. 5. Currently, Viacom has a ten-member board of directors. Eight new directors, drawn from CBS' current board, will be added to the Viacom board after closing. For a period of three years, there can be no change in the size of the Viacom board or any removal of a CBS director without a supermajority vote of the board members. During that same period, directors from the CBS group will appoint replacements of the CBS directors. Likewise, directors from the Viacom group will appoint replacements for the Viacom directors. At the end of the three years, all directors will be elected by plurality vote of the Class A shareholders, whose votes are under Mr. Redstone's control. 6. Following the merger, Mr. Redstone will remain chairman and chief executive officer of 4  On April 28, 2000, Viacom filed an amendment pursuant to Section 1.103 of our Rules requesting that the effective date of this order be the date of adoption. We will grant the request. 5  Between them, the applicants also have interests in various program production companies, cable networks, publishing houses and record companies. This order only addresses the transfer of the various licensees and permittees regulated by the Commission. 6  At the time of the application, NAI intended to create a new, wholly owned subsidiary, NAIRI, Inc. which would be the single majority shareholder of Viacom. In any event, Sumner Redstone would continue to control NAI and remain in control of Viacom.  2   Federal Communications Commission Viacom. Mel Karmazin, the current president and chief executive officer of CBS, will become president and chief operating officer of Viacom. III. The Dual Network Rule 7. CBS is the owner of the CBS television network, one of the nation's four largest broadcast networks. Viacom owns UPN, the United Paramount Network, a relatively new national broadcast network.7 Section 73.658(g)(1) of our rules prohibits any entity from owning two or more television ""networks."" That rule defines a network as an entity ""...which offers an interconnected program service on a regular basis for 15 or more hours per week to at least 25 affiliated television licensees in 10 or more states....""8 CBS, with its nationwide coverage, provides programming well in excess of 15 hours per week to over 25 affiliates and, therefore, is covered by this definition. While UPN does not fit within this network definition, the Dual Network Rule prohibits the common ownership of a network defined under (g)(1) with: ""...an English-language program distribution service that, on February 8, 1996, provided four or more hours of programming per week on a national basis pursuant to network affiliation arrangements with the local television broadcast stations in markets reaching more than 75 percent of television homes...""9 Viacom argues that UPN did not have the requisite audience reach on February 8, 1996 to be covered by (g)(2). In its petition, WEYS challenges the contention that UPN would not be covered by the Dual Network Rule. Viacom also argues that, should the Commission find that UPN is covered by (g)(2) and that the combined entity violates the Dual Network Rule, it should be allowed twenty-four months to come into compliance because of the unique circumstances of this transaction.10 ACA, WEYS, NBMC and Belo argue that the requested twenty-four months is without precedent, against the public interest, potentially anti-competitive and should be denied. 8. Viacom concedes that UPN provided four or more hours of programming per week on a national basis pursuant to network affiliation arrangements with local broadcast stations. However, Viacom claims that UPN's national audience reach on February 8, 1996 was only 72.4% of television homes, based on a count of stations with which UPN held a primary affiliation agreement.11 In making this claim, Viacom excludes from its count any stations with which UPN held a secondary affiliation agreement. The stations that had a secondary affiliation agreement with UPN reached an additional 18.6% of television households, giving a total of 91% of television households that UPN reached either through primary or secondary affiliates.  7  At the time the application was filed, Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. owned 50% of UPN. Pursuant to a buy/sell option, Viacom has acquired all of Chris-Craft's interest in UPN and is now the sole shareholder. Viacom amended the applications to reflect this transaction on March 27, 2000. 8 9  47 C.F.R.  73.658(g). This provision implements  202(e) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996). 47 C.F.R. 73.658(g)(2)  10  NBMC claims that we should deny the applications just because the applicants have requested a reasonable time following any grant of the applications to come into compliance with our rules. It has long been Commission practice, however, in multi-station transactions to allow a reasonable time for parties to come into compliance with our rules. See, e.g., Multimedia, Inc., 11 FCC Rcd 4883 (1995). 11  See Viacom Exhibit F.  3   Federal Communications Commission 9. Viacom argues that secondary affiliation agreements are ""license agreements"" which are, in effect, syndication agreements. These license agreements permit programs to be aired ""out of pattern"" at times negotiated by the station. For example, rather than run a UPN program during its regularly scheduled network time, a secondary affiliate might run that program on the weekend or in late night. Also, Viacom states that secondary affiliates are not required to identify and promote their connection with UPN, denying the network the benefit of ""branding"" with those stations. Finally, secondary affiliates receive a separate feed from the primary affiliates, which does not include network promotions or programs containing the UPN logo at the bottom of the screen. Viacom also argues that the plain language of neither  73.658(g) nor the underlying statute specifically states that the Dual Network Rule is to apply to UPN. 10. Though Viacom may call its ""arrangements"" with its secondary affiliates ""license agreements,"" it still considers those stations as UPN affiliates and not merely as stations to which a Viacom subsidiary sells programming. Both the statute and the rule refer to network affiliation ""arrangements"" and do not make any distinction between primary and secondary affiliates. There is no evidence that Congress intended for such a distinction to be made. Indeed, if Viacom's argument is accepted, then  202(e) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not apply to anyone and Congress has enacted a law with no meaning or purpose. It is a basic rule of statutory construction that a statute is presumed to have some meaning and application.12 Furthermore, Viacom's argument that the Dual Network Rule does not refer to UPN by name and should not automatically be considered to include UPN directly contradicts the legislative history of the provision, which refers by name to the two ""emerging networks, (WBTN, UPN)"" in describing the networks to which the prohibition applies.13 Therefore, it appears clear that Congress intended the Dual Network Rule to apply to UPN. Recognizing that Congress intended the Dual Network Rule to apply to UPN and crafted it to so apply, we are persuaded that all network affiliation agreements, primary and secondary, should be counted towards determining a network's national audience reach. We conclude that  73.658(g)(2) includes UPN within its prohibition on dual network ownership. 11. In support of their alternative request for twenty-four months to come into compliance with the Dual Network Rule, the applicants argue that requiring the merged entity to sell a national broadcast network, with the concomitant effects on the financial standing of the network, its affiliates and its program suppliers, is without precedent. The applicants state that (1) UPN, its affiliate stations and its program suppliers are all financially inter-dependent; (2) UPN is not financially self-supporting; (3) an independent purchaser is unlikely to assume the financial burden that Viacom has been carrying due to the high cost of maintaining UPN; (4) the challenges presented by any divestiture are without precedent; and (5) it would serve the public interest to allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to come into compliance in such a way as to preserve UPN's unique services. The applicants also point out that UPN relies extensively on UHF stations and in some cases LPTV stations to reach its audience. As noted above, in some cases UPN does not have a primary network affiliation agreement with these stations. The applicants claim that carriage under these circumstances is undesirable and will hurt any efforts to sell UPN. The applicants further assert that no party has come forward to express any serious interest in buying UPN. Finally, the applicants argue that, should no buyer be found and they be forced to shut down Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 2A,  46.06, at 63 (4 ed. C. Sands, 1973)(""It is a recognized principle that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.""); see also, Policy and Rules Concerning Rates for Competitive Common Carrier Services, 84 FCC 2d 445, 508 (1981). 13 12 th  142 Cong. Rec. H1078-03, *H1121.  4   Federal Communications Commission UPN, this would reduce program diversity. They argue that this loss would be even more serious in light of UPN's history of presenting programming targeted to minorities and of creating opportunities for minorities to participate in the creation, production, writing and on-air presentation of programming. Therefore, the parties ask for a twenty-four month period to come into compliance with the Dual Network Rule in order to avoid creating a situation where it would be necessary to simply shut down the network. 12. ACA, WEYS, NBMC and Belo all oppose a twenty-four month period to come into compliance as excessive and assert that it would provide no public interest benefit. ACA in particular asserts that the ownership of two networks will lead to abuses in the granting of retransmission consent, abuses to which small cable operators are especially vulnerable. ACA also asserts that CBS/Viacom will use the Dual Network Rule to subsidize UPN, again by possibly manipulating the terms of retransmission consent agreements. Belo points out that there will be markets where CBS or UPN owned and operated affiliates will be competing against independent affiliates of the one of the networks owned by CBS/Viacom, which could lead to unfair treatment of the independent affiliates.14 13. On March 27, 2000, the applicants filed an amendment (""Amendment"") to reflect Viacom's acquisition of the remaining interest in UPN and to make certain representations regarding the operations of UPN during any period prior to coming into compliance with the Dual Network Rule. In the Amendment, the parties pledged: Subject to Viacom' right to terminate UPN, Viacom will preserve UPN as a viable, independent voice distinct from that of the CBS Television Network during the period of time granted by the Commission for Viacom to come into compliance with the dual network rule. To this end, the executives in charge of programming at UPN will be responsible solely for advancing the interests of that network. As they do today, the two networks will continue to strive for diverse audiences consistent with their separate programming strategies. Although the UPN television programming executives may participate in incentive compensation plans related to the performance of Viacom as a whole, such executives' compensation will not be otherwise directly related to the performance of the CBS Television Network. 14. We will deny the requested twenty-four month period, but will grant the parties twelve months for the combined CBS/Viacom to come into compliance with the Dual Network Rule. Before entering into this transaction, the applicants were aware that it could violate the Dual Network Rule. They cannot claim any surprise that compliance with the law is required. We recognize that there are inter-dependent relationships between program suppliers, affiliates and UPN, but we do not believe those relationships are an impediment to bringing the merged entity into compliance with the rule. Indeed, those very relationships are part of the value of UPN. Viacom initially argued that sale of UPN would be especially complex given that the network was, in part, owned by Chris-Craft. Viacom, however, exercised a buy/sell option with its former co-owner Chris-Craft. The exercise of this option gave Chris-Craft the opportunity to buy out Viacom's interest in UPN for $5 million. Chris Craft declined to make this purchase. Viacom states that Chris-Craft ""reportedly attempted but failed to line up additional partners 14  Belo, ACA and WEYS also allege that the proposed transaction will result in becoming too concentrated and that the merged CBS/Viacom will exert undue market Department of Justice examined this specific issue in connection with its review determined not to intervene in the transaction. In our discretion, we conclude that no these matters is warranted based on the record here.  the program supply market influence in that market. The of the broader merger and further action with respect to  5   Federal Communications Commission interested in investing"" in UPN. Viacom also states that ""notwithstanding wide public knowledge of the potential divestiture of UPN, Viacom received no bona fide proposals to purchase its 50 percent interest in the network."" 15. Although Congress clearly intended the Dual Network Rule to apply to UPN, there is no evidence that Congress intended for UPN or any other network to be sold at a ""fire sale."" The Commission has long granted parties a reasonable time to come into compliance with our rules.15 In the cases of station divestitures we have generally allowed a period of six to twelve months to come into compliance, and, consistent with those decisions, we find that a period of twelve months would be appropriate here. 16. Although we recognize the concerns of the petitioners regarding the potential for abuse of market power by the applicants during the period prior to coming into compliance, there is no evidence that such conduct will actually occur, or that such potential abuses should be addressed by the Commission as opposed to anti-trust authorities. Furthermore, we believe the pledges made by the applicants regarding the separate operations of the two networks and the relatively limited period allowed for coming into compliance minimize our concerns in this area. If the combined CBS/Viacom entity does violate our rules, we can take appropriate action against such misconduct at that time. IV. The National Ownership Cap 17. In their application, the parties state that the merged CBS/Viacom would control 38 television stations (including one construction permit), provide programming to two additional stations pursuant to local marketing agreements and have an ownership attributable interest in one additional television station.16 These stations are licensed to 32 DMA's17 and reach slightly more than 41 percent of all national television households.18 18. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Commission's rules prohibit the grant, transfer or assignment of any television license to any entity if it would result in that entity having a cognizable interest in television stations with an aggregate national audience reach exceeding 35 percent.19 Because the aggregate national reach of the stations owned by the combined CBS/Viacom would be over 6% in excess of the permitted level, the parties have asked for 24 months to come into compliance with the statute and rule. ACA, WEYS, NBMC and Belo oppose granting the requested 24 months because there is no precedent so to do and because it would not be in the public interest. 15 16  See, e.g., Multimedia, Inc., 11 FCC Rcd 4883 (1995).  CBS/Viacom will program stations pursuant to out-of-market LMAs in the Fort Pierce-West Palm Beach, Florida, and Providence, Rhode Island - New Bedford, Massachusetts DMAs. In the Marquette, Wisconsin DMA, CBS/Viacom will own a satellite whose parent station is located in the Green Bay-Appleton, Wisconsin DMA. Pursuant to Broadcast Television National Ownership Rules, FCC 99-208, MM Docket No. 96-222,  20 and 29 (rel. August 6, 1999)(""Television National Ownership Rules ""), all three DMAs are counted in determining CBS/Viacom's national audience reach. 17  Every television station is assigned to a ""designated market area"" (""DMA"") by the Neilsen ratings service. A station's DMA indicates the primary market for that stations service. The Commission uses these DMA's as the basis for several of the multiple ownership rules. See, e.g., Review of the Commission's Regulations Governing Television Broadcasting, 14 FCC Rcd 12903 (1999). 18 19  Telecommunications Act of 1996,  202(c)(1); 47 C.F.R.  73.3555(e). Id.  6   Federal Communications Commission 19. The parties have intertwined their arguments in support of a 24-month period to come into compliance with the national ownership cap with their arguments for the same amount of time to come into compliance with the Dual Network Rule. They repeatedly state that the interests of UPN, of the various stations they refer to as owned and operated and of the independently owned UPN affiliates are complex and interdependent. The parties claim their situation is different from other Commission proceedings requiring divestiture because as many as 16 television stations may have to be sold to come into compliance with the national ownership cap. They also cite to Commission proceedings involving divestiture requirements under the newspaper/television cross-ownership rule and the cable/television cross ownership rule where the Commission has allowed up to 24 months to come into compliance.20 The parties do not cite to any case that only involved the divestiture of television stations where the Commission has permitted more than 6 months to come into compliance with the multiple ownership rules. 20. First, there is no evidence that the applicants have to sell 16 stations to come into compliance with the national ownership cap. As Belo points out, they could sell fewer stations in larger markets to come into compliance with the rule. We will not dictate which stations the applicants must sell to come into compliance with the national ownership cap, but we note that the combined entity could sell a single television station, rather than 16 spread around the country, and come into compliance.21 21. Second, all of the cases that the applicants cite in support of a divestiture period longer than 12 months dealt with proceedings where parties needed to comply with either the newspaper/television cross-ownership rule or the cable/television cross-ownership rule. In those cases, the Commission permitted the longer divestiture period because the relevant market factors associated with the sale of newspapers or cable systems, such as the possible lack of demand for a newspaper or the limited number of potential buyers, were different from those affecting broadcast stations. This is especially true over the last several years where the number of sales of broadcast stations have increased significantly. In other words, the Commission specifically distinguished those proceedings from broadcast station proceedings. There are no cases involving only broadcast properties in which the Commission has permitted more than 12 months for the requisite divestitures to come into compliance with our rules. 22. The Commission has historically held, in multiple station transactions, that the overall benefits of allowing time for an orderly divestiture of broadcast properties outweighs the impact on diversity and competition from common ownership during a reasonable period following the grant of the application. However, the Commission has never found that a period greater than 12 months was appropriate to accomplish the needed divestitures in a transaction where only television stations were involved. No arguments or evidence have been presented in this proceeding to convince us that we should give the parties twice the longest amount of time we have granted in the same type of transactions. Therefore, we deny the request for 24 months to come into compliance with the national ownership cap and instead give the applicants twelve months to comply.

Local Television Ownership Rule 23. Background and Standard. The merger of Viacom with CBS will result in the common ownership of two television stations in the same Nielsen DMA in the following six markets: Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Miami, and Pittsburgh. With regard to the television duopoly rule, in the Television Ownership Order,22 we modified our rules to allow common ownership of two stations in the same DMA, if eight independently owned and operating commercial and noncommercial television stations will remain in the DMA post-merger, and at least one of the stations is not among the top fourranked stations in the market. As detailed below, Viacom has submitted a showing representing that each of these newly created television duopolies will comply with our modified television duopoly rule.23 24. Showing of Compliance. First, in Philadelphia, the fourth ranked DMA, Viacom controls the license of WPSG(TV), Channel 57 and CBS controls the license of KYW-TV, Channel 3. Station WPSG(TV) has the sixth largest audience share and KYW-TV has the third largest audience share in the market. At least seventeen independently owned and operating television stations will remain in the Philadelphia DMA post-merger. In Boston, the sixth ranked DMA, Viacom controls the license of WSBK-TV, Channel 38 and CBS controls WBZ-TV, Channel 4. Station WSBK-TV has the sixth largest audience share and WBZ-TV has the third largest audience share in the market. At least 15 independently owned and operating television stations will remain in the Boston DMA post-merger. Next, in the seventh ranked Dallas-Fort Worth DMA, Viacom controls KTXA(TV), Channel 21, and CBS controls KTVT(TV), Channel 11. Station KTXA(TV) has the fifth largest audience share and KTVT(TV) has the fourth largest audience share in the market. At least 14 independently owned and operating television stations will remain in the Dallas-Fort Worth DMA. Detroit, the eighth ranked DMA, is host to Viacom's WKBD(TV), Channel 50, which has the fifth largest audience share in the market and CBS's WWJ-TV, Channel 62, which has the fourth largest audience share. The Detroit market will have at least eight independently owned and operating television stations remaining in the DMA post merger. In Miami, the 16th ranked DMA, Viacom controls WBFS-TV, Channel 33, and CBS controls WFOR-TV, Channel 4. With regard to audience share, the stations are ranked fourth and fifth, respectively. After the proposed merger, at least 13 independently owned and operating television stations will remain in the Miami DMA. Finally, Pittsburgh, the 20th ranked DMA, is host to Viacom's WNPA(TV), Channel 19, and CBS's KDKA-TV, Channel 2. Station WNPA(TV) has the seventh largest audience share and KDKA-TV is ranked number one, with the largest audience share in the market. Following the proposed merger, at least 8 independently owned and operating television stations will remain in the Pittsburgh DMA. 25. Discussion. Having reviewed the showing submitted by the parties, we find that the television duopolies created by the Viacom-CBS merger in the Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Miami, and Pittsburgh DMAs, will be in compliance with the Commission's modified television duopoly rule. Each of the affected markets is served by a minimum of eight independently owned and operating television stations. Additionally, in each market at least one of the two commonly owned television stations is not among the top four-ranked stations. Accordingly, the proposed station combinations meet the new standards of our television duopoly rule, and we believe our core concerns regarding competition and diversity will continue to be protected upon consummation of the proposed merger. 22 23  14 FCC Rcd at 12903.  All of the audience share statistics are based on the July 1999 Nielsen Ratings, the most current statistics available at the time the parties filed the transfer of control applications.  8   Federal Communications Commission B. Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule  26. Background and Standard. Currently, CBS controls radio and television station combinations in twelve markets: Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, New York, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Austin and Dallas/Fort Worth.24 The proposed Viacom-CBS merger will result in radio and television station combinations in an additional eight markets: Atlanta, Houston, Seattle, Tampa, Sacramento, Columbus, West Palm Beach and Washington, D.C. Thus, in total, Viacom will control radio-television combinations in 20 U.S. television markets. In the Television Ownership Order, we relaxed the radio-television cross-ownership rule ""to permit same market joint ownership of radio and television facilities up to a level that permits broadcasters and the public to realize the benefits of common ownership while not undermining our competition and diversity concerns.""25 There are three elements to the revised rule. First, a party may own up to two television stations (provided this is permitted under our revised duopoly rule or television LMA grandfathering policy) and up to six radio stations in any market where at least 20 independently owned media voices remain in the market.26 In those markets where the voice count component of our revised duopoly rule and radio-television cross-ownership rule would allow a two television/six radio station combination, it may be in the form of one television station and seven radio stations.27 Second, we will permit common ownership of up to two television stations (provided this is permitted under our revised duopoly rule or television LMA grandfathering policy) and up to four radio stations in any market where at least ten independently owned media voices remain in the market. Third, we will permit common ownership of up to two television stations (provided this is permissible under our revised duopoly rule or television LMA grandfathering policy) and one radio station regardless of the number of independent voices in the market.28 We note that, in accordance with the Television Ownership Order, where a merger involves stations in different radio metro markets, the voice count requirement must be satisfied in each of those radio metropolitan markets (""radio metro markets"") to qualify under our voice count criteria. As detailed below, Viacom has submitted an exhibit, which purports to show that Viacom's television-radio station combinations will be in compliance in 15 of the 20 markets. In the remaining five markets, Viacom requests a period of six months to divest the requisite number of its radio stations in order to comply with the revised radio-television cross-ownership rule. According to Viacom's showing, the merged entity will comply with the numerical ownership/voice dependent limitations of the radio-television cross-ownership rule in the markets of Tampa-St Petersburg, Fort Pierce-West Palm Beach, Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Columbus, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Minneapolis, New York, Washington, D.C., and Austin.  24  A Viacom television station will be also be added to the CBS radio/television combinations in each of the Boston, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Dallas/Fort Worth markets. 25 26 27 28  14 FCC Rcd at 12947. Id. Id., at 12950 Id., at 12947  9   Federal Communications Commission 1. Tacoma Tampa-St. Petersburg, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, Seattle-  27. Discussion. Based on the number of stations in the radio and television station combinations to be held by Viacom in Tampa-St. Petersburg, New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, and SeattleTacoma, at least 20 independently owned media voices must remain in these markets post-merger.29 Viacom's showing represents that, in compliance with our revised radio-television cross-ownership rule, at least 20 voices will remain within each of these markets after the proposed merger. The station combinations for each of the DMAs will be as follows: one television/six radio stations in Tampa-St. Petersburg; one television/six radio stations in New York; two television/five radio stations in Philadelphia; two television/six radio stations in Detroit; two television/five radio stations in Boston; and one television/five radio stations in Seattle-Tacoma. We believe Viacom has sufficiently shown that there will be at least 20 independent media voices for each station in each of these markets post merger, as consistent with the numerical ownership limitations of such combinations in the first prong of our revised radio-television cross-ownership rule, and that common ownership of two television stations in the Philadelphia, Detroit, and Boston DMAs will not violate our revised duopoly rule or television LMA grandfathering policy. 2. Fort Pierce-West Palm Beach, Atlanta, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Houston, Minneapolis, Austin 28. Discussion. In order to comply with our revised radio-television cross-ownership rule, the number of stations in the radio and television station combinations to be held by Viacom in the markets of Fort Pierce-West Palm Beach, Atlanta, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Houston, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Austin, require at least 10 independently owned media voices to remain in the market post-merger.30 29  The merged entity will control the following television and radio station combinations: Tampa-St. Petersburg (CBS's WQYK(AM) Seffner, FL;WQYK-FM, St. Petersburg, FL; WYUU(FM), Safety Harbor, FL; WLLD(FM), Holmes Beach, FL WRBQ-FM, Tampa, FL; WSJT(FM), Lakeland, FL and Viacom's WTOG(TV), Channel 44, St. Petersburg, FL); New York (CBS's WCBS-TV, Channel 2; WINS(AM), WNEW(FM), WCBS-FM, WCBS(AM), WFAN(FM), WXRK(FM) all licensed to New York, NY); Philadelphia (CBS's KYW-TV, Channel 3; KYW(AM), WPHT(AM), WOGL-FM, WIP(AM), WYSP(FM) and Viacom's WPSG(TV), Channel 57 all licensed to Philadelphia, PA); Detroit (CBS`s WWJ-TV, Channel 62; WVMV(FM), WWJ(AM), WKRK-FM, WOMC(FM), WYCD(FM), WXYT(AM) and Viacom's WKBD-TV, Channel 50 all licensed to Detroit, MI); San Francisco (CBS's KPIX-TV, Channel 5; KYCY(AM), KYCY-FM, KITS(FM), KCBS(AM), KLLC(FM), KFRC(AM), KFRC-FM all licensed to San Francisco, CA); Boston (CBS's WBZ-TV, Channel 4 WBMX(FM), WBZ(AM), WODS(FM), WBCN(FM), WZLX(FM) and Viacom's WSBK-TV, Channel 38, all licensed to Boston, MA); and Seattle-Tacoma (CBS's KMPS(AM), KMPS-FM, KYCW(FM), KZOK-FM, all licensed to Seattle, WA, KBKS(FM) and Viacom's KSTW(TV), Channel 11, both licensed to Tacoma, WA) . 30  Fort Pierce-West Palm Beach (CBS's WIRK(FM), WEAT-FM licensed to West Palm Beach, FL and Viacom's WTVX(TV), Channel 34, Fort Pierce, FL); Atlanta (CBS's WZGC(FM), WAOK(AM), WVEE(FM) and Viacom's WUPA(TV), Channel 69, all licensed to Atlanta, GA); Columbus (CBS's WAZU(FM), Circleville, OH; WHOK(FM), Lancaster, OH and Viacom's WWHO, Channel 53, Chillicothe, OH); Pittsburgh (CBS's KDKA-TV, Channel 2, WDSY(FM), WBZZ(FM), KDKA(AM) all licensed to Pittsburgh, PA; WZPT(FM) New Kensington, PA and Viacom's WNPA(TV), Channel 19, Jeannette, PA); Houston (CBS's KIKK(AM), Pasadena, TX, KIKK-FM, KILT(AM), KILT-FM and Viacom's KTXH(TV), Channel 20, all licensed to Houston, TX); Minneapolis (CBS's WCCO-TV, Channel 4, WCCO(AM), WLTE(FM) all licensed to Minneapolis, MN, KSGS(AM), WXPT(FM) both licensed to St. Louis Park, MN); Austin (CBS's KEYE-TV, Channel 42, KKMJFM, both licensed to Austin, TX; KJCE(AM), Rollingwood, TX, KQBT(FM), Taylor, TX and KAMX(FM), Luling, TX).  10   Federal Communications Commission As to the station combinations, there will be a one television/two radio station combination in West Palm Beach, a one television/three radio station combination in Atlanta, a one television/two radio station combination in Columbus, a two television/four radio station combination in Pittsburgh, a one television/four radio station combination in Houston, a one television/four radio station combination in Minneapolis, and a one television/four radio station combination in Austin. We have reviewed Viacom's showing of compliance and find that the proposed station combinations will comply with the numerical ownership/voice count limitations of our radio-television cross-ownership rule after consummation of the proposed merger. As required by the second prong of our radio-television cross-ownership rule, we find that at least 10 independently owned media voices will remain in the market for each of the stations licensed to these DMAs post-merger, and that common ownership of two television stations in the Pittsburgh DMA will not violate our revised duopoly rule or television LMA grandfathering policy. 3. Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Sacramento, San Francisco  29. In the Baltimore DMA and radio metro market, CBS controls one television station and eight radio stations. CBS also controls the licenses of six radio stations licensed to communities in the Washington, D.C. radio metro market, which is in the Washington, D.C. DMA. The communities of license are encompassed by the CBS Baltimore television station's Grade A contour, although they are in a separate DMA and a separate radio market from the television station.31 Because Viacom currently controls a television station in the Washington, D.C. DMA, the merged entity would have a one television/six radio station combination in the Washington, D.C. market 30. A similar situation exists in the Sacramento market. There CBS currently controls seven radio stations licensed to the Sacramento radio metro market and Viacom controls one television station in the Sacramento DMA. CBS also controls one television station and seven radio stations in the San Francisco DMA and radio metro market. The 2mV/m contour of one of CBS's radio stations licensed to the San Francisco DMA and radio metro market encompasses Sacramento. The parties argue that prior Commission precedent and market place realities dictate that the relevant market for the three Washington, D.C. and one San Francisco radio stations, should be the DMA in which the stations are located. 31. CBS commonly owns its radio and television station combinations in the Baltimore and Washington markets, pursuant to conditional waivers of the Commission's former radio-television crossownership rule.32 When evaluating these waiver requests, the Commission focused its review on the market where the stations were located. In granting these waivers, the Commission treated the Washington stations and the Baltimore stations as being located in separate markets. We have continued to follow this policy with similarly-situated radio-television cross-ownership combinations. For example, we found New York to be the relevant market for New York radio stations that fell within the Grade A contour of a commonly-owned television station located in the Hartford-New Haven DMA, for purposes of our radiotelevision cross-ownership rule.33 In the circumstances of this case, therefore, as consistent with precedent, we find that when applying the revised radio-television cross-ownership rule in the Baltimore and 31  The radio-television cross-ownership rule is triggered when the Grade A contour of a television station encompasses the community of license of a radio station, or when the 1 mV/m contour of an FM station or the 2 mV/m contour of an AM station encompasses the community of license of a television station. 32  See Stockholders of Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 12 FCC Rcd 5012 (1996). See also Shareholders of American Radio Systems Corporation, 13 FCC Rcd 12430 (1998); WHFS, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 3965 (1997). 33  See, e.g. A T & T Corporation, 13 FCC Rcd at 4633, 4644 (1998).  11   Federal Communications Commission Washington markets, the relevant market for a station is the market in which that station is located. Further, when determining compliance under the three prongs of our revised rule in the Baltimore and Washington markets, if a radio station in a combination is located in a separate radio metro market and DMA from a commonly-owned television station, that radio station will not count toward the number of stations that an entity may control. Accordingly, in analyzing the Baltimore DMA, we will not count the three CBS radio stations located in the Washington, D.C. DMA as part of the Baltimore market, even though those stations are within the Grade A contour of CBS' Baltimore television station. In addition to being consistent with precedent, we believe our decision here reflects the Commission's rationale for modification of our radio-television cross-ownership rule, ""to balance our traditional diversity and competition concerns with our desire to permit broadcasters and the public to realize the benefits of radio and television common ownership."" 32. With respect to the Sacramento combination, CBS's San Francisco radio station KFRC(AM) triggers the radio-television cross-ownership rule because its 2mV/m contour completely encompasses Sacramento. Viacom claims that the relevant market for KFRC(AM) should be San Francisco, the DMA in which the station is located. Encompassment by the relevant signal contour (in this case, 2mV/m ), and not the DMA, determines whether we will count radio station towards the number of stations an entity may control in one market.34 Consequently, Viacom will control a one television/eight radio station combination in the Sacramento market, which they acknowledge will violate our radio-television crossownership rule. We will provide Viacom six months to file the application necessary to bring it into compliance with the radio-television cross-ownership rule in the Sacramento market. 33. We shall now evaluate Viacom's showing in the markets of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and San Francisco based on our decisions in the two paragraphs above. In the Washington, D.C. DMA, Viacom will control a one television/six radio station combination. Since 20 media voices will remain in the relevant market post-merger, this combination comports with our radio-television cross-ownership rule. However, in the Baltimore DMA, Viacom will control a one television/eight radio station combination. Since Viacom does not meet the voice count component of the revised duopoly rule, this combination will violate the radio-television cross-ownership rule. Viacom, therefore, has pledged to divest two Baltimore radio stations, which will result in the DMA containing a one television/six radio station combination in a market where 20 media voices will remain post-merger. We find, therefore, that the proposed station combinations in the market of Washington, D.C. will comply with the numerical ownership/voice count limitations of our radio-television cross-ownership rule post-merger, and that the proposed combination in the Baltimore market will comply with the numerical ownership/voice count limitations of our radio-television cross-ownership rule following divestiture of two radio stations. As detailed below, Viacom has requested a six-month waiver in order to come into compliance in the Baltimore market. Finally, in the San Francisco market, Viacom will control a one television/seven radio station combination. At least 20 media voices will remain in the San Francisco market post-merger, at least eight of which are independently owned and operating television stations in the San Francisco DMA. We find, therefore, that the proposed combination in the San Francisco market will comply with the numerical ownership/voice count limitations set forth in the first prong of our radio-television crossownership rule.  34  Media Communications Partners, L.P., 10 FCC Fcd 8116 (1995).  12   Federal Communications Commission 4. Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Fort Worth  34. Waiver Request. In addition to the Baltimore and Sacramento markets, the merger of Viacom and CBS would not comply with the radio-television cross-ownership rule in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Fort Worth.35 With regard to the Los Angeles and Chicago DMAs, Viacom will control a one television station/eight radio station combination post merger in each of these markets. Viacom has pledged to divest one Los Angeles radio station and one Chicago radio station, which will result in each DMA containing a one television/seven radio station combination. In markets where the voice count component of our revised duopoly rule and radio-television cross-ownership rule would permit a party to own two television and six radio stations, for a total of eight outlets, we also permit that party to own the same number of outlets in the form of one television and seven radio stations.36 Consequently, a one television/seven radio station combination will be permissible in these markets if they meet the voice count restrictions for both our revised duopoly rule and radio-television cross-ownership rule. Each relevant market, therefore, must contain at least 20 independently owned media voices post-merger, and each DMA must contain eight independently owned and operating commercial and noncommercial television stations. A one television/seven radio station combination will meet the numerical ownership/voice count limitations of our new radio-television cross-ownership rule in both the Los Angeles and Chicago markets. As for the Dallas-Fort Worth DMA, Viacom will control a two television/eight radio station combination post merger. Here, Viacom has pledged to divest two radio stations in order to come into compliance with our revised radio-television cross-ownership rule. This two television/six radio station combination also requires at least 20 independently owned media voices remaining in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and must meet our revised duopoly rule and television LMA grandfathering policy. 35. Viacom asks the Commission for a six-month period of time from consummation to file applications to divest the radio stations in the Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Ft. Worth markets. According to Viacom, the Commission has long held that allowing those entities proposing mergers or transfers of multiple stations a reasonable period of time to come into compliance with our rules is supported by the benefits derived from such transactions. Citing Stockholders of CBS, Inc., Viacom further contends that we allow such relief where the conflicts are incidental to the much larger merger, will promote commerce, encourage investment in the broadcast industry, and allow for the free transferability of broadcast licenses. In addition, Viacom contends the Commission has stated that a forced, immediate sale could impose severe economic hardship on applicants without offsetting public interest benefits, restrict the value of the assets and artificially limit the range of potential purchasers.37 Viacom also argues that this six-month period of time would have no appreciable impact on diversity or competition. All of the markets requiring divestiture are among the 25 largest media markets in the country. The Commission has previously allowed common ownership by CBS in Los Angeles, Chicago and Baltimore of one television/eight radio station combinations, at least on a temporary basis due, in ""substantial part"" to the level of diversity and competition in these markets. Finally, Viacom points out that under the modified ownership rules, these television/radio combinations would have been grandfathered, and CBS afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that permanent retention of these stations  35 36 37  In each of these markets, Viacom has decided to maintain control of the television stations in the combination.

See, e.g., Multimedia, Inc. 11 FCC Rcd 4883, 4889 (1995); Stockholders of CBS, Inc., 11 FCC Rcd at 3755 (1995).  13   Federal Communications Commission would serve the public interest. 38  36. Discussion. As Viacom has noted, several of our past decisions did find temporary waiver of our multiple ownership rules appropriate to facilitate multi-station transactions, especially when such waiver was incidental to the larger transaction.39 Since that time, we have released our Television Ownership Order, which substantially relaxes our radio-television cross-ownership rule, and allows broadcasters the opportunity to take advantage of common ownership of a greater number of television and radio stations in a given market. We continue, however, to weigh our decisions against our underlying goals of diversity and competition in the broadcast market place. After reviewing the record, we do not believe that the public interest will be disserved by allowing Viacom six months to divest the necessary number of radio stations to come into compliance with our rules. The stations to be divested make up a small portion of an extremely large merger involving two networks and multiple broadcast stations. Additionally, the markets involved are among the largest in the country, each served by a plethora of independent media voices. Our review of the applicant's showing finds that the Baltimore market will have at least 27 independently owned media voices post merger. The Chicago, Los Angeles and DallasFort Worth markets will each host at a minimum 32 independently owned media voices post merger. We also believe it is important to note that under our relaxed ownership rules, these radio/television combinations in Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth would be grandfathered until at least 2004 had CBS and Viacom not entered into this proposed merger.40 Should the proposed transfer of control not take place, it is possible that these radio/television combinations would exist for at least four more years. Thus, this brief six-month period to divest the stations, we believe, would not harm diversity or hinder competition in a manner conflicting with the public interest. We will, however, prohibit Viacom from divesting the stations to any party whose acquisition would require waiver of our multiple ownership rules. C. Satellite Waivers 37. We next consider the proposal of Viacom to continue operating stations KCCO-TV, Alexandria, Minnesota, and KCCW-TV, Walker, Minnesota, as satellites of WCCO-TV, Minneapolis, Minnesota and station WJMN-TV, Escanaba, Michigan as a satellite of WFRV-TV, Green Bay, Wisconsin. Viacom requests a continuing satellite exemption of the local television multiple ownership rule, 47 CFR  73.3555(b), with respect to WCCO-TV, KCCO-TV, and KCCW-TV, which are all located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota DMA. A satellite exemption is no longer required to permit common ownership of WJMN-TV and WFRV-TV pursuant to the local television multiple ownership rule, 47 CFR 73.3555(b), as they are licensed to separate DMAs. Viacom requests, instead, a waiver of the main studio rule, 47 CFR 73.1125, to permit continued operation of WJMN-TV without a local main studio.41 38 39  Television Ownership Order at 12957.  See, e.g., The Providence Journal Company, 12 FCC Rcd 2883 (1997); Argyle Television, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 10737 (1997). 40  We require applicants for transfer of control to demonstrate compliance with the radio-television cross-ownership rule. However, for parties who were previously granted waivers conditioned on the outcome of the report and order, we have extended those conditional waivers for parties that do not comply with the modified radio-television cross-ownership rule until the conclusion of our biennial review in 2004. 41  Section 73.1125(a) of the Commission's rules requires that a local main studio be maintained either within the station's community of license; within the principal community contour of any AM, FM or TV broadcast station licensed to the station's community of license; or within twenty-five miles from the reference coordinates of the (continued....)  14   Federal Communications Commission 38. Viacom bases its requests for satellite exemptions on the standards adopted in Television Satellite Stations, 6 FCC Rcd 4212, 4215 (1991). Under that standard, applicants acquiring satellite stations must show that the stations meet our satellite policy at the time of the assignment. However, an applicant will be entitled to a presumption that satellite operation is in the public interest if it meets three criteria: (1) no City Grade contour overlap exists between the parent and the satellite; (2) the satellite would provide service to an underserved area; and (3) no alternative operator is ready and able either to construct or to purchase and operate the satellite as a full-service station.42 If an applicant cannot qualify for the presumption, we will evaluate the proposal on an ad hoc basis to determine whether other compelling circumstances warrant grant of a waiver.43 39. The satellites meet the first criterion because the City Grade contour of WCCO-TV does not overlap the City Grade contour of either KCCO-TV or KCCW-TV. With respect to the second criterion, Viacom has demonstrated, by using our ""transmission"" test, that the respective areas are underserved. That test deems an area underserved if there are two or fewer full-service stations licensed to a proposed satellite's community of license. No other full-service television station is licensed to Walker, Minnesota, KCCW-TV's community of license and only one other full-power television station is licensed to Alexandria, Minnesota, KCCO-TV's community of license. 40. As to the third criterion, we note that the Commission has approved continuing satellite status for these stations on two recent occasions.44 In these determinations, the Commission relied on submissions demonstrating that it would not be feasible to find a purchaser willing to operate any of the stations on a stand-alone basis due to the small size of the respective markets, the expense of upgrading each station to a stand-alone facility, and other demographic considerations. Viacom has submitted further evidence demonstrating the unfeasibility of finding a purchaser willing to operate the respective stations on a stand-alone basis, and we agree that the facts show that operation of the satellites as full-service stations is unlikely to be profitable. While we find that this showing fails to meet the ""presumptive"" satellite waiver standard, we do believe that it is strong enough to support continued satellite operation under our ad hoc analysis. Therefore, we will grant Viacom authority to continue to operate these stations as satellites. As to the main studio rule, the applicants have demonstrated that the Escanaba market is extremely limited in size, that no other television station is licensed to that community and that maintenance of a main studio in Escanaba is not economically viable. Based on this showing, we will grant a waiver of the main studio rule, pursuant to 47 CFR  73.1125, with regard to WJMN-TV.

In its petition to deny and intervene,45 NBMC alleges that the proposed merger violates numerous Commission rules and the public interest. Among the rules alleged to be violated are our EEO rules and the news distortion policy.46 We deny NBMC's petition. 42. NBMC has claimed that there are 12 EEO proceedings pending against the applicant. Even if evidence regarding these proceedings had been provided, the applicants only would have been required to provide information regarding adverse findings or adverse final actions falling within the specified categories of misconduct. 43. Finally, on the issue of news distortion, NBMC seems to allege that certain CBS affiliates in Mississippi have either distorted or suppressed news related to civil rights issues. There are no specific allegations of fact to support this claim.47 In addition, none of the stations that are the subject of the applications are located in Mississippi. There is no legal basis to hold that CBS is liable for the local programming decisions of independently owned affiliates or that such programming decisions are in any way relevant to the merger. NBMC has failed to present any legal basis or to proffer any evidence that would support denying the CBS/Viacom application. Therefore, we deny its petition. B. The Stern Petitioners 44. In their petition to deny, Al Westcott, Tom Blackwell, and Glenn and Kathleen Benfield (collectively the ""Stern Petitioners""), allege that CBS has been violating 18 U.S.C.  1464, which governs the broadcast of indecent or obscene material.48 These violations are alleged to have taken place during the broadcast of Howard Stern's radio program. They also allege that CBS has permitted its radio stations to broadcast ""threatening remarks"" against individuals who might file a complaint with the Commission, law enforcement agencies or sponsors regarding the Howard Stern show. Finally, the Stern Petitioners contend that CBS should be held liable for the actions of an alleged serial rapist in New York who apparently was a listener of the Howard Stern show. In its opposition, CBS argues, among other things, that a September 1, 1995 Settlement Agreement between Infinity and the Commission specifically precluded use of material aired prior to the agreement as a basis for a petition. CBS also argues that any material aired prior to June 4, 1998 is irrelevant as the Commission has already considered, and passed upon, the qualifications of CBS within the context of a separate transfer of control application.  45. Section 310(d) of the Communications Act, by incorporating Section 308(b), requires us to consider a proposed transferee's character qualifications before granting a transfer of control application. This consideration entails examination of the transferee's compliance with the Communications Act and 45  NBMC filed an amended petition to deny and intervene on January 4, 2000. The substantive allegations in the amended and original petitions are the same. 46  NBMC also makes a blanket accusation that the applications are ""fraught with anti-trust Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Security [sic] and Exchange Commission and indeed certain Internal Revenue Service violations."" NBMC does not, however, make any specific factual statements to support these vague, generalized allegations. Given this lack of particularity and substantiation, we conclude that no action on our part with respect to NBMC's assertions is warranted. 47 48  Galloway v. FCC, 778 F2d 16, 20 (D.C. Cir. 1985); Hunger in America, 20 FCC 2d 143, 150 (1969). 18 U.S.C.  1464 is reflected in our rules at 47 C.F.R.  73.3999.  16   Federal Communications Commission with our rules, including our indecency restrictions.49 On December 26, 1996, the Commission approved the transfer of control of Infinity radio stations to Westinghouse Electric Corporation.50 At that time, the Commission dismissed two letters alleging that Infinity committed ""past and pending"" violations of federal indecency law by broadcasting the ""Howard Stern Show,"" because the letters failed to raise a substantial or material question of fact concerning indecent programming. 51 The Commission also noted that certain broadcasts of the ""Howard Stern Show,"" even if they were indecent, did not disqualify Infinity as a Commission licensee.52 On December 1, 1997, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, having merged with CBS prior to purchasing Infinity, changed its name to CBS Corporation, and, on June 4, 1998, purchased the stock of American Radio Systems pursuant to Commission consent granted on May 27, 1998.53 The Stern Petitioners base their instant petition to deny on transcripts of broadcasts aired prior to the May 27, 1998 order. Not only has the Commission considered substantially the same issues within the context of our approval of the Westinghouse/Infinity merger, but has reviewed, and passed upon, CBS's basic qualifications when approving the transfer of control of American Radio Systems stations. These issues have been decided by the Commission and will not be revisited. 46. With respect to the allegation that CBS permitted their radio stations to broadcast ""threatening remarks"" from Howard Stern, the Commission has already determined that the allegedly threatening remarks made by Mr. Stern were ""`off-the-cuff' comments complaining about those listeners who allegedly [] paraphrased his material incorrectly,"" and were not ""calculated to threaten or intimidate"" those complaining about his broadcasts.54 We see no reason to alter this conclusion in the context of this application. 47. Finally, we reject the argument that CBS should be held liable for rapist in New York who happened to be a listener to the program. Absent some as direct incitement, we will not hold a broadcast station liable for the actions of Consequently, for the reasons set forth above, we deny the petition filed by Kathleen Benfield, and Tom Blackwell. VII. Administrative Matters the actions of an alleged tangible, causal link, such any or all of its listeners. Al Westcott, Glenn and  48. We have reviewed the proposed merger and the related pleadings and find that the applicants are fully qualified and that grant of the transfer of control of the CBS broadcast stations to Viacom will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. 49. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED, That the petitions to deny filed by the American Cable Association, the National Black Media Coalition, the WEYS Television Corporation, and the Stern Petitioners ARE DENIED, and the letter filed by A.H.

Communications Commission 56. In the Matter of the Applications of Shareholders of CBS Corporation (Transferor) and Viacom, Inc. (Transferee) For Transfer of Control of CBS Corporation and Certain Subsidiaries, Licensees of KCBS-TV, Los Angeles, CA et al. Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART  I.  I concur in the fundamental decision to grant CBS's application to transfer radio licenses to Viacom, Inc. I also concur in the Order's disposition of matters relating to the dual network rule, national ownership cap, local television ownership rules, satellite waivers, and petitions to deny this transfer. Although I strongly support timely deregulatory action on our ownership rules in the context of the broadcast biennial review, I must at the same time acknowledge their current legal force and effect and therefore agree with their application to the instant license transfer request. I must dissent, however, from application of the radio-television cross ownership rule to CBS/Viacom because that rule shrinks the combined entity's statutory right to local radio ownership. To my mind, such a result is in derogation of statutory right and thus untenable under the Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. section 706 (providing that a ""reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . short of statutory right""). As I stated in last year's review of local broadcast ownership rules: I believe that limitations on radio ownership under the one-to-a-market rule that constrict the statutory radio ownership caps in section 202(b) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 are legally unsound. As [here],there are instances where ownership of a television station in addition to radio stations will trigger application of the one-to-a-market rule, which may impose lower caps on radio ownership than does section 202(b). Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, In the Matter of Review of the Commission's Regulations Governing Television Broadcasting and in the Matter of Television Satellite Stations Review of Policy and Rules, 14 FCC Rcd. 12,903 (rel. Aug. 6, 1999) (""Local Ownership Report""). For example, under section 202(b), a broadcaster is affirmatively and specifically authorized to own as many as 8 stations in certain local markets. See 47 U.S.C. section 202(b) (""[I]n a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate, or control up to 8 commercial radio stations, not more than 5 of which are in the same service.""). But under the Commission's one-to-amarket rule, which was promulgated pursuant to the generalized public interest standard, a party may not, contrary to the express language of section 202(b), own 8 radio stations if it happens to also own a television station in that market. In such a situation, the party can own only 1 television and 7 radio stations or 2 television and 6 radio stations. See Local Ownership Report at para. 9 & n.19. This contraction of statutory ownership rights is exactly what happened to CBS/Viacom in the Sacramento, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas-Fort Worth markets. See Memorandum Opinion & Order at paras. 29-36. Under section 202(b), as long as there are 45 radio stations in the market (an issue the Order does not even address), CBS/Viacom is by federal statute affirmatively entitled to own 8 radio stations. Yet by dint of the radio-television cross-ownership rule, the Commission forces the company to divest itself of property in order to fall within a wholly regulatory, more restrictive limit. 24   Federal Communications Commission  Again, as I have previously explained: Nothing in section 202(b). . . indicates that radio ownership rights are contingent on nonownership of a television station. Section 202(b) is not phrased in the conditional; it does not say that ownership of other kinds of communications properties should adversely affect the rights established by that section. Nor are the ownership rights created there limited to ""radio-only"" combinations, as the Commission [calls them]; rather, the provision simply speaks of radio ownership, without reference to broadcast combinations. The one-to-a-market rule is, of course, based on the generalized ""public interest"" standard, whereas the caps established in 202(b) are very specific. Regulations promulgated under the general public interest grant of authority should not trump such particularized decisions by Congress. In short, the Commission cannot by rulemaking shrink statutorily granted ownership rights. Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, Local Ownership Report. While I have my policy and even constitutional concerns with the other ownership limits applied today and hope to see them soon repealed or modified, none of them is clearly in derogation of a positive statutory right to ownership at defined levels. Because this is true of the radio-television cross-ownership rule, its operation in this Order appears to violate the Administrative Procedure Act. I cannot vote for such action, especially where, as here, the limit in question is not statutorily required. Finally, I note my hope and expectation that other license transfer applicants will be subject to the same straightforward approach to section 309 taken in this Order  namely, application of existing statutory provisions and Commission rules to the proposed transfer, without a separate (and usually more restrictive) analysis taken pursuant to the public interest standard. I also hope and expect that other license transfer applicants will receive the same reasonable treatment when it comes to objections grounded in antitrust theory  that is, deferral to the Department of Justice. See Memorandum Opinion and Order at para. 16 (suggesting that concerns regarding potential abuse of market power should be addressed not by the Commission but by antitrust authorities); id. at n. 13 (noting that DOJ has examined the specific issue of concentration in program supply markets and thus declining to address the matter). For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part but dissent from the relevant radio-television part of this decision.  25   Federal Communications Commission II. III. MAY 3, 2000 A. B. STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER GLORIA TRISTANI, DISSENTING IN PART  Re: CBS-Viacom Merger The Commission's Order approving the merger between CBS and Viacom is most notable for what it fails to address. As mystery readers know, sometimes it is the dog that does not bark that explains a situation's underlying reality. Diversity First, the Order completely ignores the effect of the CBS-Viacom merger on one of the 55 fundamental purposes of the Communications Act  maintaining a diversity of media voices. The potential concentration of viewpoints on television is especially important. Television is still the means by which most Americans get their news and information, and is still the medium 56 that children spend far more time with than any other. One would never know from the Commission's Order that this merger involves the combination of two of the behemoths of the media industry. CBS owns, among other interests, the CBS network (with over 200 affiliates), 20 television stations, 162 radio stations, cable networks TNN and Country Music Television, King World and Eyemark Entertainment. Viacom owns, among other interests, the UPN network, 17 television stations, Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, Spelling Entertainment Group, Blockbuster Video, Simon and Schuster, and cable networks MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, VH-1, Showtime, TV Land and the Movie Channel. 55  See, e.g., Communications Act, Section 257 (noting that one of the ""policies and purposes"" of the Communications Act favors a ""diversity of media voices""); Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 567 (1990) (""Safeguarding the public's right to receive a diversity of views and information over the airwaves is therefore an integral component of the FCC's mission""); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 663 (1994) (""[I]t has long been a basic tenet of national communications policy"" that ""the widest dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public""), quoting United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U.S. 649, 668 n.27, quoting Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 20 (1945).  Kaiser Family Foundation Report (1999) (finding that, on average, children watch 2 hours and 46 minutes of television a day, compared to 48 minutes spent listening to CDs or tapes, the second most popular media activity).  56  26   Federal Communications Commission  Will the combination of these assets give one entity too much control over the marketplace of ideas? The Commission provides no analysis, and, most disturbing, does not even ask the question. The Commission's failure to examine this issue constitutes an abdication of its responsibility to ensure that the merger will serve the public interest and effectuate the purposes 57 of the Communications Act. Ultimately, the American public will pay the price if they do not have meaningful access to the diverse and antagonistic viewpoints that democratic deliberation requires. I express no opinion on the results of such a diversity analysis in this case. But the Commission's failure to even raise the issue is an ominous development for those who are looking to the Commission to examine these mega-mergers in their broader context, rather than simply as a mechanical exercise to verify compliance with specific rules. Radio Market Definition  Second, the Commission fails to acknowledge that it shifts the definition of ""radio market"" to suit its purposes. In particular, the Commission ignores the conflict between the definition of radio ""market"" it applies to the one-to-a-market rule and the definition of radio ""market"" that applies to the local radio ownership cap rules. Put simply, under the market definition adopted for the one-to-a-market rule, a radio station is present only in the Arbitron market to which it is assigned (unless its contour completely encompasses the city of license of a television station in another market, as CBS's San Francisco radio station KFRC(AM) does in Sacramento). By contrast, under the local ownership cap rules, a radio ""market"" is defined as all stations with signal contours that overlap the commonly-owned stations, regardless of the Arbitron market to which those stations are assigned. The Order's failure to address the conflicting market definitions is all the more glaring because the one-to-a-market and local ownership cap rules are contained in the very same section of the Commission's rules (Section 73.3555). I understand the desire to pretend that the local ownership cap rules do not exist. As I have  57  See Communications Act of 1934, Secs. 310(d) and 309(e); Application of Telecommunications, Inc. and AT&T Corp., 14 FCC Rcd 3160, 3168-69 (1999).  27   Federal Communications Commission  written on several occasions, those rules are irrational and there is no defending them. One of the problems is that a radio market definition based on overlapping signal contours often results 59 in markets that bear little relation to reality. The Order implicitly agrees, rejecting the notion that radio markets should be defined by overlapping signal contours. Instead, the Order looks to the markets established by a commercial ratings service as a more appropriate reflection of which stations actually serve particular listeners. Logically, the Commission's shifting definitional approach makes no sense. Either radio stations with overlapping signal contours should count as being in the same ""market"" or they should not. They cannot count as being ""in the market"" for one part of Section 73.3555 and then ""out of the market"" for another. Beyond the illogic, these conflicting market definitions have a clear real-world effect: they permit more consolidation than if the Commission applied a consistent market definition. For the local ownership caps, the more stations that count as being ""in the market"" the greater the consolidation, because the rules provide for increasing levels of ownership as the number of stations in a market increases. A radio market definition based on signal contour overlaps can dramatically increase the number of stations in the ""market"" as distant stations whose signals overlap with the outermost reaches of stations in the market are swept into the count. In the recent situation in Wichita, Kansas, for example, the Commission's signal contour approach more than doubled the number of stations that Arbitron assigned to the Wichita market -- from 24 to 52 stations. That increase meant that an entity could own up to eight stations in Wichita, rather than only six that would be possible under Arbitron's station count. Similarly, CBS owns 5 FM stations in the 38-station Sacramento Arbitron market. But in a 38-station market, CBS would be limited to no more than 4 FM stations. In order to be able to own a fifth FM station, CBS must rely on out-ofmarket stations with overlapping signal contours as being ""in the market.""  58  For the one-to-a-market rule, the consequences of using a signal contour method are reversed -- bringing additional stations into the market generally would restrict consolidation. Here, for instance, CBS-Viacom will own one television and 7 radio stations in both the San Francisco and Sacramento markets. That could not happen under a signal contour approach, because the San Francisco stations would put CBS-Viacom over the one-to-a-market rule limit in Sacramento, and vice versa. 58  See, e.g., Press Statement of Commissioner Gloria Tristani re: Mass Media Bureau Approval of Radio License Transfers in Youngstown-Warren, Ohio and Lafayette, Louisiana (March 20, 2000); Press Statement of Commissioner Gloria Tristani re: Applications for Radio License Transfers in Augusta-Waterville, Maine (rel. Feb. 28, 2000); Press Statement of Commissioner Gloria Tristani re: Mass Media Bureau's granting of applications to transfer radio licenses from Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting to Citadel Broadcasting in Portland, Maine (rel. Aug. 19, 1999); Dissenting Statement of Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, In re Applications of Pine Bluff Radio, Inc. and Seark Radio, Inc. File Nos. BAL-970103EA, BALH-970103EB, BALH970103EC (rel. April 12, 1999); Joint Statement of Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, In re Station KBYB(FM), El Dorado, Arkansas, 13 FCC Rcd 15685 (1998).  59  See, e.g., Press Statement of Commissioner Gloria Tristani re: Mass Media Bureau Approval of Radio License Transfer in Wichita, Kansas, (March 24, 2000) (although Arbitron assigned only 24 radio stations to the Wichita, Kansas market, the Mass Media Bureau counted 52 radio stations in the market under the contour overlap approach, including several Oklahoma stations whose signals did not even reach Kansas).  28   Federal Communications Commission  In other words, the Commission treats the San Francisco and Sacramento stations as being in the same market to permit a level of consolidation that otherwise would not be possible, but then it treats them as being in separate markets when counting them together would limit consolidation under other rules. It's tempting to say that the Commission simply adopts whatever definition of radio market will maximize consolidation, regardless of logic or consistency. One might be able to dismiss such a charge as cynical, but not as inaccurate. Conclusion  Those who are counting on the Commission to use its public interest authority to scrutinize the impact of huge media mergers should be disheartened by this decision. The Commission shows little sensitivity to the broader context in which these mergers are taking place, and little stomach for limiting consolidation based on diversity concerns. The sound of a dog not barking is a clue; the sound of a watchdog not barking is a problem.  29"

These call signs have a three-fold purpose. They identify the  nationality  of the station, the  type  of station, and the  individual  station. Radio call signs, in effect, are the ""license plates"" that identify communication traffic on the radio highways.    The need for station identification is emphasized by the fact that the United States, which leads all other countries in the use of radio, now has some 85 different kinds of radio services providing land, sea, air and space communication services.       HOW CALL SIGNS ARE DESIGNATED       Since the early days of wireless telegraphy, starting with marine use, radio stations have had their own identification. Under international agreement, since 1927 the alphabet has been divided among nations for basic call sign use. The United States, for example, is assigned three letters--N,K, and W-- to serve as initial call letters for the exclusive use of its radio stations. It also shares the initial letter A with some other countries. The letter A is assigned to the Army and Air Force; N to the Navy and Coast Guard, and K and W to domestic stations, both government and non-government.    The Communications Act gives the FCC authority to designate call letters to all United States radio stations. This is done on an individual station basis. A and N block assignments are designated for government use. Further details on the FCC's requirements for the identification of radio stations may be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 2, (Subpart D) of the rules. Some types of radio stations and equipment, such as radar stations and diathermy equipment, are exempt from such requirements.    BROADCAST STATION IDENTIFICATION       Broadcast stations in this country are assigned call signs beginning with K or W. Generally speaking, those beginning with K are assigned to stations West of the Mississippi River and in U.S. territories and possessions, while those beginning with W are assigned to broadcast stations East of the Mississippi River. During radio's infancy, most of the broadcast stations were in the East. As stations began operating, the Mississippi became the dividing line between K and W call signs. The few exceptions to existing call signs within this system were assigned before the allocation plan was adopted. Station KDKA, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is one example.    Since the beginning of broadcasting, stations have had the privilege of requesting specific call signs. In requesting their preferences for certain letters of the alphabet, broadcasters have presented combinations of names, places or slogans. For example, the letters NBC are used for stations owned by the National Broadcasting Company, CBS for those of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and ABC for the American Broadcasting Companies. Examples of individual station call letters are: WGN, Chicago (""World's Greatest Newspaper""), WNYC, New York (New York City municipal station); KAGH, Crossett, AK, (""Keep Arkansas Green Home""); WIOD, Miami (""Wonderful Isle of Dreams""); WLS, Chicago (""Worlds Largest Store""); WACO, Waco Texas); WTOP, Washington, D.C. (""Top of the Dial""); KFDR, Grand Coulee, Washington, (Franklin D. Roosevelt); WCFL, Chicago (""Chicago Federation of Labor""); WMTC Vancleve, KY, (""Win Men to Christ""); WGCD, Chester, S.C. (""Wonderful Guernsey Center of Dixie""); Educational TV station WXXW, Chicago, uses the Roman numerals for its channel 20; and KABL, Oakland, CA, selected its letters to represent San Francisco's famous cable cars. If a new broadcast station makes no specific request, it is assigned a call sign by the FCC. Since 1946 the FCC has not guaranteed specific call signs to be granted prior to the grant of a construction permit or special temporary authority.    As broadcast stations began to increase in the early 1920's, the three letter call sign could no longer accommodate the growing number of stations, making it necessary to add a fourth letter.    With the advent of FM and TV in 1941, new call signs for all such stations were not assigned. Rather, since many FM and TV stations were operated by the same AM licensee at the same license area, the general practice was for the associated FM or TV station to simply add ""-FM"" or ""-TV"", to the call sign of the co-owned AM station. International Radio Regulations do not require the use of call signs by broadcast stations if some other suitable means of identification is employed. For example, many foreign stations identify by announcing, ""The Voice of ... ""or ""Radio...""    AMATEUR CALL SIGNS       Amateur radio station call signs are assigned by an automatic system that selects the call sign from an alphabetical listing depending upon the operator's license class and mailing address. Although amateur call signs are for the purpose of identifying the station rather than the operator, call signs are often personal in nature. For example, these call signs often appear on correspondence and on automobile license plates, i.e. NJ9AZ. There are even grave stones bearing the cherished call signs of amateurs who have sent their final sign-off signal ""SK"".       DISTRESS CALLS       Records indicate that a British vessel used radio as early as 1899 to summon aid. The first radio distress call from an American vessel has been traced to 1905. But radio operator Jack Binns made headlines in 1909 when he stuck to his post on the stricken steamship REPUBLIC to send the distress signal then in use, ""CQD"". In 1912 the ill fated TITANIC flashed the same call.    Before the turn of the century there was no special radiotelegraph call for emergencies at sea. One pioneer operator simply sent the letters ""HELP"" in code. In 1903, Italy suggested ""SSSDDD"" as an international radio emergency call. By 1904, a number of ships engaged in Atlantic trade were equipped with ""wireless"", as radio was then known, and they recruited land telegraph operators for sea duty. These operators resorted to the landline general call ""CQ"", meaning ""attention all stations"". In 1904, the Marconi Company added the letter ""D"" to signal distress.    Meanwhile, German ships had been using ""SOE"" and in 1906 Germany recommended these letters as an international distress call. This combination was deemed unsatisfactory to radiotelegraphy because the final dot was often obliterated by static or other interference. The American delegation to an international conference suggested ""NC"", which is the call for help in flag signaling. However, international agreement was reached on ""SOS"", which became effective in 1906, though ""CDQ"" continued to be used by British ships for some years thereafter.    For radiotelephone purposes, or voice transmission, the international distress call is ""MAYDAY"", which corresponds to the French phrase ""m'aider"" meaning ""help me"". It was adopted from a British proposal approved by an international convention in 1927. It has since been used by military as well as civilian ships and aircraft. In 1963, an international telecommunication conference agreed that the distress signals ""SOS"" and ""MAYDAY"" should also be used in space communication.

As a consequence, we have reviewed the existing policies, focusing on  . . .  :  (1) the broadcast of announcements relating to goods and services for which consideration is received by the station;  (2) enhanced underwriting and donor announcements;  (3) the offering of program-related materials; . . . .

TABLE OF CONTENTS     Announcements Promoting the Sale of Goods and Services    Enhanced Underwriting and Donor Acknowledgements   Program Related Materials   Recent Orders     Contact for More Information   Comments and Suggestions About this Page        Related information about broadcast stations is located at:    Audio Division  --  Video Division  --  Media Bureau   Federal Communications Commission         Announcements Promoting Goods and Services    Section 399B of the Communication's Act of 1934, as amended, and Sections 73.503(d) and 73.621(e) of our rules specifically proscribe the broadcast of announcements by public broadcast stations which promote the sale of goods and services of for-profit entities in return for consideration paid to the station.  These rules, however, permit contributors of funds to the station to receive on-air acknowledgements.  The Commission has articulated specific guidelines which emphasize the difference between permissible donor and underwriter announcements and commercial advertising.   See Commission Policy Concerning the Noncommercial Educational Nature of Educational Broadcasting Stations , 97 FCC 2d 255 (1984) (hereafter referred to as "" 1984 Order "");  Commission Policy Concerning the Noncommercial Educational Nature of Educational Broadcasting Stations , 90 FCC 2d 895 (1982) (hereafter referred to as "" 1982 Order   "";     Second Report and Order , 86 FCC 2d 141 (1981);  First Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking , 69 FCC 2d 200 (1978).   Recent cases before the Commission indicate that some noncommercial broadcasters have aired outright commercial messages on behalf of profit making entities in violation of our rules and the statute (footnote omitted).  As our action in those cases attest, we will enforce our prohibition on the broadcast of commercial messages on behalf of profit making enterprises for which consideration is paid to the station. Information brought to the attention of the Commission regarding such practices will be scrutinized and licensees found to have engaged in them will be sanctioned.    Return to Table of Contents     Enhanced Underwriting and Donor Acknowledgements    Beyond the airing of paid promotional announcements, our recent review of underwriting activities indicates that some public broadcasters may be airing donor and underwriter announcements which exceed the Commission's guidelines.  In light of these instances and an ongoing debate in the public broadcasting community on these issues, we believe that a brief statement concerning the obligations of public broadcasters with respect to donor and underwriting acknowledgements is appropriate.  In March 1984, we relaxed our noncommercial policy to allow public broadcasters to expand or ""enhance"" the scope of donor and underwriter acknowledgements to include  (1) logograms or slogans which identify and  do not  promote,  (2) location information, (3) value neutral descriptions of a product line or service, and  (4) brand and trade names and product or service listings.   1984 Order  at 263.  That action was taken as another step in our ongoing effort to strike a reasonable balance between the financial needs of public broadcast stations and their obligation to provide an essentially noncommercial service.  It was our view that ""enhanced underwriting"" would offer significant potential benefits to public broadcasting in terms of attracting additional business support and would thereby improve the financial self-sufficiency of the service without threatening its underlying noncommercial nature.  In this regard, we emphasized that such announcements could not include qualitative or comparative language and that the  Order  should not be construed as allowing advertisements as defined in Section 399B of the Communications Act.   Id.   (Footnote 1)    We recognized in our  1982 Order  that it may be difficult at times to distinguish between announcements that promote and those that identify. For that reason, we expressly stated that we expect public broadcast licensees to review their donor or underwriter acknowledgements and make reasonable good faith judgements as to whether they identify, rather than promote.   1982 Order  at 911. We saw no purpose at the time, or at the time we adopted our  1984 Order , in fashioning rigid regulations or guidelines to ensure the noncommercial nature of public broadcasting, and we were concerned that such guidelines would inhibit public broadcasters' ability to seek and obtain the funds needed to present quality programming and to remain financially viable.  It continues to be our view that the public broadcaster's good faith judgement must be the key element in meeting Congress' determination that the service should remain free of commercial and commercial-like matter.  In response to requests for guidance, however, we will attempt to further clarify the guidelines applicable to public broadcasters' exercise of their discretion.    We reiterate that acknowledgements should be made for identification purposes only and should not promote the contributor's products, services, or company.  For example,logos or logograms used by corporations or businesses are permitted so long as they do not contain comparative or qualitative descriptions of the donor's products or services. Similarly, company slogans which contain general product-line descriptions are acceptable if not designed to be promotional in nature.  Visual depictions of specific products are permissible.  We also believe that the inclusion of a telephone number in an acknowledgement  is within these general guidelines and, therefore permissible.   Several examples of announcements that would clearly violate the rule may be helpful:    A.  Announcements containing price information are not permissible.  This would include any announcement of interest rate information or other indication of savings or value associated with the product. An example of such an announcement is:    -- ""7.7% interest rate available now.""    B.  Announcements containing a call to action are not permissible.  Examples of such announcements are:    -- ""Stop by our showroom to see a model"";  -- ""Try product X next time you buy oil.""    C.  Announcements containing an inducement to buy, sell, rent, or lease are not permissible.  Examples of such announcements are:    -- ""Six months' free service"";  -- ""A bonus available this week"";  -- ""Special gift for the first 50 visitors.""       Additionally, examples of proscribed product messages can be seen in the instances where the Commission has assessed forfeitures or issued letters of warning for rule violations.  Footnote 2   .   We repeat that the Commission will continue to rely on the good faith determinations of public broadcasters in interpreting our noncommercialization guidelines.  We emphasize, however, that we will review complaints and, in the event of clear abuses of discretion, will implement appropriate sanctions, including monetary forfeitures.    Return to Table of Contents    Program Related Materials    We have reviewed the Commission's policies regarding the offering of program-related materials.  We have looked carefully at this area because it has come to our attention that such offerings have been used by noncommercial educational licensees to raise funds for program acquisition purposes, a novel fund raising device.   Our  1982 Order  dealt with the sale of program-related materials.  It concluded that because Congress has approved direct promotional fundraising announcements by nonprofit organizations, public broadcasters could air announcements promoting program-related materials sold by nonprofit organizations, including the station itself.   1982 Order  at 907.  It is our belief that in order for the audience to be informed about the sponsor of these offerings, the nonprofit organization sponsoring the offering should be clearly identified in the announcement, a requirement in keeping with the mandate of Section 317 of the Communications Act and  Section 73.1212  of our rules.   Guidelines covering announcements for the sale of program-related materials by for-profit entities were not changed by our  1982 Order .  Thus, such announcements are permitted so long as the licensee  (1) receives no consideration for the announcement; and  (2) the materials are offered on the basis of public interest considerations and not the private economic interests of the offeror; or  (3) the price of the materials offered is only nominal.   Second Report and Order , 86 FCC 2d at 152.  As noted above, the nominal price requirement does not apply to offerings sponsored by nonprofit entities.

The announcement must be made when the subject matter is broadcast.  The Commission has adopted a rule, 47 C.F.R. § 73.1212, which sets forth the broadcasters' responsibilities for sponsorship identification       Section 507 of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 508 requires that when anyone pays someone to include program matter in a broadcast, the fact of payment must be disclosed in advance of the broadcast to the station over which the mater is to be carried.  Both the person making the payment and the recipient are obligated to disclose the payment so that the station may make the sponsorship identification announcement required by Section 317 of the Act. Failure to disclose such payments is commonly referred to as ``payola'' and is punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.  These criminal penalties bring violations within the purview of the Department of Justice.     Thus, for example, if record companies or their agents pay broadcasters to play records on the air, those payments are legitimate if the required sponsorship identification message is aired.  If it is not aired as required by the Communications Act and the Commission's rules, the broadcast station will be subject to enforcement action.       If record companies, or their agents, are paying persons other than the licensee to have records aired, and not disclosing that fact to the licensee, the person making such payments, and the recipient, are subject to fine, imprisonment or both.

(""Telenor""). COMSAT holds various earth station, Private Land Mobile Radio (PLMR), and experimental licenses, as well as international Section 214 authority.    The proposed transaction involves the assignment of both private and common carrier Title III licenses.  In addition, the assignment of the common carrier Title III licenses from COMSAT to Telenor will result in the indirect foreign ownership of the licensee, Telenor Satellite, Inc., in excess of the 25-percent foreign ownership limit in Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (""the Act"").  Telenor Broadband Service AS of Norway (""Telenor Broadband"") established Telenor Satellite Mobile Services, Inc. (""TSMS"") as a U.S. holding company earlier this year to serve as the proposed buyer of the Comsat Mobile Communications business from COMSAT.  TSMS wholly owns Telenor Satellite, Inc., the proposed licensee.  TSMS is 100% owned by Telenor Broadband, which is in turn 100% owned by Telenor ASA, a company incorporated in Norway and based in Oslo.   Seventy nine percent of Telenor ASA stock is owned by the Kingdom of Norway and the remaining twenty one percent  is publicly traded on the NASDAQ and Oslo Stock Exchanges.  Norway is a WTO-member country.     Therefore, the Applicants request a declaratory ruling that the acquisition of these authorizations and licenses by Telenor Satellite, Inc. and the proposed operation by TSMS of the CMC business, is consistent with Section 310 of the Act and will serve the public interest. Additionally, the Applicants request that the Commission approve the assignment of various  international Section 214 authorizations from COMSAT to Telenor Satellite, Inc.  The Applicants request non-dominant classification for all U.S.-foreign point routes except for U.S.-Norway.  The Applicants do not request streamlined processing.    Upon initial review, we find that the applications listed below are acceptable for filing.  Pursuant to the Commission's rules, we may return any of these applications if we determine upon further review that they are defective or not in conformance with our rules, regulations, or policies.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this  Notice of  Apparent Liability  for  Forfeiture  (``NAL''), we  find that  Networx Corporation  (``Networx'')  has  apparently violated  Section 301  of  the Communications  Act  of  1934, as amended,1  (``the Act'') by  operating an unlicensed  FM  broadcast station on  the frequency  94.5 MHz  at the  Cumberland  Crossings Retirement  Community  in Carlisle,  Pennsylvania.   We  conclude that Networx is apparently liable for forfeiture in  the  amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).                           II.  BACKGROUND       2.   On or about October 19, 2000, the Enforcement  Bureau's  Philadelphia Office received information  from the engineer of  a  local radio station that an  unlicensed FM broadcast station  was  allegedly operating in the  Newtown Square, Pennsylvania area  on  the frequency 105.7 MHz.        3.   On that same  day, FCC  agent David  Dombrowski of  the  Philadelphia Office used direction  finding techniques to  locate  the source of the transmissions on the frequency 105.7 MHz to the  Dunwoody  Village,  3500  West  Chester  Pike,  Newtown   Square,  Pennsylvania  19073.    The   FCC   agent   observed   that   the  transmissions from the station could be detected with a  standard  car radio  approximately  0.5  mile from  the  Dunwoody  Village.   Nancy  Morrison,   the  Recreation   Director,  permitted   agent  Dombrowski to inspect the  FM broadcast station.  Nancy  Morrison  explained that the Dunwoody Village subscribes to an FM broadcast  service on the  frequency 105.7 MHz  called ``Companion  Radio.''   Networx Corporation  installed  and  operates  the  FM  broadcast  station equipment at the Dunwoody Village to provide the service.         4.   Radio  stations  in  the   FM  broadcast  band,   i.e.,  broadcast stations that  transmit on a  frequency between 88  and  108 MHz, must be licensed by the FCC (47 U.S.C. 301).  The only  exception to this licensing requirement in the FM broadcast  band  is  for   certain  non-licensed   low-power  radio   transmitters  operating  at  a  power  level  that  complies  with  47   C.F.R.  15.239.2  This section  limits such transmitters  to the  field  strength of  250 mV/m  at a  distance of  three meters  from  the  transmitting antenna.   On  October 23,  2000,  Agent  Dombrowski  returned to Dunwoody Village and used a calibrated Potomac FIM-71  Field Strength  Meter  to make  a  measurement of  the  station's  signal at a distance of 100 feet from the antenna.  The FCC agent  measured a field strength  of 1,785 mV/m  on the frequency  105.7  MHz.  The FCC  agent used extrapolation  to calculate the  signal  strength at three meters from  the station's antenna.  The  agent  determined that  the station's  signal exceeded  the  permissible  level  for  a  non-licensed   radio  transmitter  by  73   times.   Accordingly, a  license  is required  for  the operation  of  the  station.  Based on the Commission's records, no license has  been  issued for  the operation  of  an FM  broadcast station  at  this  location.  Thus,  the  station  was  operating  in  violation  of  Section 301 of the Act.       5.   On October  30,  2000,  the  Philadelphia  Office  sent  Networx a  letter warning  that operation  of the  unlicensed  FM  broadcast station  on the  frequency 105.7  MHz at  the  Dunwoody  Village violated Section 301 of  the Act; outlined the  potential  penalties for operating  the unlicensed station  in violation  of  Section 301 of the Act, including seizure of the equipment, fines  and imprisonment; and directed Networx to terminate operation  of  the unlicensed  station  immediately.   The  Philadelphia  Office  requested Networx Corporation to submit a written response within  10 days of receipt of the letter.       6.   By letter  dated  November  9,  2000,  Ken  Unger,  the  President of  Networx Corporation,  submitted a  response to  the  Philadelphia Office.  Networx  Corporation acknowledged that  all  equipment utilized in its  installations remains the property  of  and is  exclusively maintained  by Networx  Corporation.  Networx  Corporation explained  that it  intended that  its  installations  comply with  the field  strength limits  specified under  Section  15.239 of the  Rules.  Networx  Corporation did  not dispute  the  field strength measurements made  by the Philadelphia Office  and  stated that  the  Potomac  Model  FIM-71  is  substantially  more  accurate than  the  equipment  Networx  Corporation  utilized  to  determine compliance.   Networx Corporation  stated that  it  had  ceased operation  of the  FM broadcast  station at  the  Dunwoody  Village on  or  about  October  25,  2000.   Networx  Corporation  assured that  it  would purchase  a  Potomac Model  FIM-71  Field  Strength Meter to conduct more accurate measurements and  confirm  that its facilities are operated  within the limits specified  in  47 C.F.R.  15.239.       7.   On August 22,  2001, the  Philadelphia Office  received  information from  the  engineer  of radio  station  WDAC  that  a  station was causing harmful interference to the reception of WDAC  on  the  frequency  94.5  MHz  in  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania.   The  offending station was identifying itself as ``Companion  Radio.''   A listener  of  WDAC who  lives  on Strayer  Drive  in  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania informed  the Philadelphia  Office that  ``Companion  Radio'' completely  wipes  out  the  reception  of  WDAC  at  her  residence.       8.   On August 23, 2001, FCC agents Trent Williams and David  Dombrowski used direction-finding techniques to locate the source  of the  broadcasts  on  94.5  MHz  to  the  Cumberland  Crossings  Retirement Community,  1  Longsdorf Way,  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania  17013.  Kathleen Bolden, the Director of Personal Care, permitted  the FCC agents to inspect the station.  Kathleen Bolden explained  that Cumberland Crossings Retirement  Community subscribes to  an  FM broadcast service on the frequency 94.5 MHz called ``Companion  Radio.''  Networx Corporation  installed and  operates the  radio  equipment at  the Cumberland  Crossings Retirement  Community  to  provide the service.      9.   Subsequently, agent Dombrowski and agent Williams  used  a  calibrated  Potomac  FIM-71  Field  Strength  Meter  to   make  measurements of the station's  signal at a  distance of 105  feet  from the antenna.  The FCC  agents measured a  field strength  of  8,841 mV/m  on  the frequency  94.5  MHz.  The  FCC  agents  used  extrapolation to calculate  the signal strength  at three  meters  from the  station's  antenna.   The agents  determined  that  the  station's signal  exceeded  the  permissible  level  for  a  non- licensed radio transmitter by  377 times. Accordingly, a  license  is required  for the  operation  of the  station.  Based  on  the  Commission's  records,  no  license  has  been  issued  for   the  operation of an FM broadcast station at this location.  Thus, the  station was operating in violation of 47 U.S.C. 301.                           III.  DISCUSSION       10.  Section  301  of  the  Act  prohibits  radio  operation  ``except under and in accordance with this Act and with a license  in that behalf granted  under the provisions  of this Act.''   As  explained above, Networx  Corporation operated  an unlicensed  FM  broadcast  station   at  the   Cumberland  Crossings   Retirement  Community  after  the  Philadelphia  Office  had  warned  Networx  Corporation in writing  that the  operation of  its FM  broadcast  station at the Dunwoody Village  was in violation of Section  301  of the Act.        11.  Based on the evidence before  us, we find that  Networx  Corporation has willfully3  violated Section 301  of the Act,  as  amended, by  operating an  unlicensed station  at the  Cumberland  Crossings  Retirement  Community  in  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania  on  August 23, 2001.   The Commission's  Forfeiture Policy  Statement  and Amendment of  Section 1.80  of the Rules  to Incorporate  the  Forfeiture Guidelines,  12 FCC  Rcd 17087,  17113 (1997),  recon.  denied, 15 FCC Rcd 303(1999) (``Forfeiture Policy  Statement'')4,  sets the base forfeiture amount at ten thousand dollars ($10,000)  for the operation  of an  unlicensed station.   In assessing  the  monetary  forfeiture  amount,  we  must  take  into  account  the  statutory factors set forth in Section 503(b)(2)(D) of the  Act,5  which include the nature,  circumstances, extent, and gravity  of  the violation, and with  respect to the  violator, the degree  of  culpability, any history of prior  offenses, ability to pay,  and  other such matters as justice  may require.  Applying the  Policy  Statement and  the  statutory factors  to  the instant  case  and  applying  the  inflation  adjustments,  we  believe  that  a  ten  thousand dollar ($10,000) monetary forfeiture is warranted.                        IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       12.  Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of the  Act, and  Sections 0.111,  0.311 and  1.80 of  the  Rules,6 Networx Corporation  is hereby NOTIFIED  of its  APPARENT  LIABILITY FOR A FORFEITURE in the amount of ten thousand  dollars  ($10,000) for  operating  unlicensed  stations  in  violation  of  Section 301 of the Act.        13.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of  the Rules, within thirty days of the release date of this  NOTICE  OF APPARENT  LIABILITY, Networx  Corporation SHALL  PAY the  full  amount of  the  proposed  forfeiture  or  SHALL  FILE  a  written  statement seeking  reduction  or  cancellation  of  the  proposed  forfeiture.       14.  Payment of  the forfeiture  may be  made by  mailing  a  check or similar instrument, payable to the order of the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois 60673-7482.  The payment should note the  NAL/Acct. No. 200232400001 and FRN # 0006-0222-97.         15.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications  Commission,  Enforcement  Bureau,  Technical  and  Public Safety Division, 445  12th Street, S.W., Washington,  D.C.  20554 and MUST INCLUDE THE NAL/Acct. No. 200232400001.        16.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.       17.  Requests for payment of the full amount of this  Notice  of Apparent Liability  under an installment  plan should be  sent  to: Chief,  Revenue and  Receivables Operations  Group, 445  12th  Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.7       18.

INTRODUCTION  1. In  this Notice of Apparent Liability  for Forfeiture (``NAL''),    we find that Mr. Charles  R. Meeker (``Meeker''), the licensee of    Class  A  Television  Broadcast (``Class  A'')  station  KDPX-LP,    apparently willfully and repeatedly violated Section 11.35 of the    Commission's Rules  and Regulations  (``Rules''),1 by  failing to    ensure that  required Emergency Alert System  (``EAS'') equipment    was installed and operational.   We conclude, pursuant to Section    503(b) of the Communications Act  of 1934,2 as amended (``Act''),    that Mr. Charles R. Meeker is apparently liable for forfeiture in    the amount of eight thousand dollars ($8,000).                            II.  BACKGROUND  2. On November  14, 2002, an agent from  the Federal Communications    Commission's (``FCC'')  San Diego  office attempted to  conduct a    routine inspection of the EAS  equipment of station KDPX-LP.  The    license  for  station  KDPX-LP  had  been  issued  to  Meeker  on    September 10, 2001.  The agent found no operational EAS equipment    at the main studio and the general manager advised that there was    no  EAS equipment  at  KDPX-LP's transmitter  site.  The  general    manager  of KDPX-LP  advised  the agent  that  the station's  EAS    equipment was taken out of  service many months ago.  However, no    evidence  or  documentation could  be  found  to verify  the  EAS    equipment condition nor  did the licensee maintain  a station log    of any previous EAS tests.                            III.      DISCUSSION  3. Section  503(b)  of   the  Act  provides  that  any  person  who    willfully or repeatedly fails to comply substantially with  the terms  and  conditions of  any license,  or  willfully or repeatedly fails to comply with  any of the provisions  of the  Act or  of  any rule,  regulation  or order  issued by  the  Commission thereunder, shall be  liable for a  forfeiture penalty.3   The term ``willful'' as used in Section 503(b) has been interpreted  to mean simply that  the acts or omissions  are committed knowingly  and the term ``repeated''  means the commission or  omission of the  act more than once or for more than one day.4  4. Commission   licensees   are   responsible   for   familiarizing    themselves and complying with  applicable statutes and Commission    Rules and policies, regardless of the length of time the licensee    has been  engaged in broadcasting.5   The Rules provide  that all    broadcast stations,  including Class  A television  stations, are    part  of  the  nationwide  EAS network  and  are  categorized  as    participating   as  national   EAS  sources   unless  a   station    affirmatively requests  authority to  not participate.6   The EAS    provides the President  and state and local  governments with the    capability to provide immediate  and emergency communications and    information to the  general public.7  State and  local area plans    identify  local  primary  sources  responsible  for  coordinating    carriage of  common emergency messages  from sources such  as the    National   Weather   Service   or  local   emergency   management    officials.8  5. The  Rules  specifically require  broadcast stations,  including    Class A television stations,9 to install and make operational EAS    equipment  (encoders, decoders,  attention signal  generators and    receivers)  so that  monitoring  and  transmitting functions  are    available   during  the   times  whenever   the  station   is  in    operation.10  The  Rules also  require broadcast stations  to (a)    receive  monthly  EAS tests  from  designated  local primary  EAS    sources and retransmit the monthly  test within 60 minutes of its    receipt and (b) conduct tests of  the EAS header and EOM codes at    least once a week at random days and times.11      6. If a broadcast  licensee's EAS equipment fails and must be taken    out for  service, the  Rules under  Section 11.35(b)  require the    licensee to note in the station log that the EAS equipment failed    and the reasons why the  failure occurred.  If the failure cannot    be corrected  within 60  days, the  Rules under  Section 11.35(c)    require the licensee to make  an informal request to the District    Director of the FCC field  office serving the area for additional    time to make necessary repairs.   This request must explain fully    why additional time is necessary and when repairs are expected to    be completed.    7. At  the time of the  inspection, no EAS equipment  was installed    or operational at station KDPX-LP,  no log existed indicating any    required monthly  or weekly  EAS test had  ever been  received or    transmitted by  the station,  and no  log existed  indicating EAS    equipment failure.  The licensee admitted having no EAS equipment    installed or  operational at the  station for more than  60 days.     The FCC San Diego office  received no request for additional time    to repair  EAS equipment.   Based on the  evidence, we  find that    Meeker willfully  and repeatedly  violated Sections 11.35  of the    Rules by failing  to have EAS equipment  installed or operational    at the time of inspection on November 14, 2002, and for more than    two months prior to the inspection date.  8.    Pursuant to  The Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and    Amendment  of  Section  1.80  of the  Rules  to  Incorporate  the    Forfeiture  Guidelines,12  the  base forfeiture  amount  for  EAS    equipment not  installed or  operational is $8,000.  In assessing    the monetary  forfeiture amount, we  must also take  into account    the statutory  factors set forth  in Section 503(b)(2)(D)  of the    Act, which include the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity    of the violation(s), and with respect to the violator, the degree    of culpability,  any history of  prior offenses, ability  to pay,    and other  such matters  as justice  may require.13   In applying    Section 1.80(b)(4) of the Rules  and the statutory factors to the    instant  case, we  find  no compelling  evidence  to support  any    adjustments to  the base forfeiture amounts.   Therefore, a total    forfeiture in the amount of $8,000 is warranted.                          IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES  9. Accordingly, IT  IS ORDERED THAT, pursuant to  Section 503(b) of    the Act, and  Sections 0.111, 0.311 and 1.80  of the Commission's    Rules, Mr. Charles  R. Meeker, is hereby NOTIFIED  of an APPARENT    LIABILITY  FOR  A FORFEITURE  in  the  amount of  eight  thousand    dollars ($8,000) for violating  Section 11.35 of the Commission's    Rules and Regulations.14  10.  IT IS FURTHER  ORDERED THAT, pursuant  to Section 1.80  of the    Rules, within thirty  days of the release date of  this NOTICE OF    APPARENT LIABILITY,  Mr. Charles  R. Meeker,  SHALL PAY  the full    amount  of  the  proposed  forfeiture or  SHALL  FILE  a  written    statement  seeking  reduction  or cancellation  of  the  proposed    forfeiture.  11.  Payment of the  forfeiture may be made  by mailing a  check or    similar  instrument,   payable  to  the  order   of  the  Federal    Communications Commission, to  the Forfeiture Collection Section,    Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box    73482, Chicago,  Illinois  60673-7482.  The payment  must include    the  FRN  number  and  must  also  note  the  NAL/Account  number    referenced in the caption.   12.  The response, if any, must be mailed to Federal Communications    Commission,  Enforcement  Bureau,  Technical  and  Public  Safety    Division, 445  12th Street, S.W.,  Washington, DC 20554  and must    include the NAL/Acct. number referenced in the caption.   13.  The Commission  will  not  consider  reducing or  canceling  a    forfeiture in response to a claim  of inability to pay unless the    petitioner submits: (1)  federal tax returns for  the most recent    three-year period; (2) financial statements prepared according to    generally  accepted  accounting  practices;  or  (3)  some  other    reliable and objective documentation that accurately reflects the    petitioner's current financial status.  Any claim of inability to    pay  must  specifically  identify  the basis  for  the  claim  by    reference to the financial documentation submitted.  14.  Requests for  payment of  the full  amount of  this Notice  of    Apparent Liability under  an installment plan should  be sent to:    Chief, Revenue  and Receivable Operation Group,  445 12th Street,    S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.15  15.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this  Notice of  Apparent Liability  for  Forfeiture  (""NAL""), we find that Networx Corporation has apparently violated  Section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934, (the ``Act''),  as  amended.1   The  violation  occurred  as  a  result  of   Networx  Corporation's  (``Networx'')  operation  of  four  FM   broadcast  stations on the frequencies  98.9 MHz, 102.9  MHz, 103.9 MHz  and  106.3 MHz at  the Presbyterian Senior  Center, 1215 Hulton  Road,  Oakmont,  Pennsylvania  without  a  license.   We  conclude  that  Networx is apparently liable  for a forfeiture  in the amount  of  $10,000.                            II.  BACKGROUND       2.   By letter  dated December  27, 2001,  the  Philadelphia  Office received a  complaint from  a local  resident of  Oakmont,  Pennsylvania alleging that a  broadcast station was operating  on  the frequency  103.9 MHz  at the  Presbyterian Senior  Center  in  Oakmont, Pennsylvania.   The complainant  also alleged  that  the  broadcast station was causing harmful co-channel interference  to  the reception  of  licensed  broadcast station  WLSW(FM)  at  his  residence.       3.   On January 12, 2002,  the Philadelphia Office  assigned  FCC Agents David Dombrowski and Frank Cranmer to investigate  the  complaint.   The  agents  used  direction-finding  techniques  to  locate the source of the transmissions on the frequency 103.9 MHz  to the  Presbyterian Senior  Center, 1215  Hulton Road,  Oakmont,  Pennsylvania.  The agents first  detected the transmissions  from  the station  with  a  standard  car  radio  at  the  Pennsylvania  Turnpike Interchange  5 which  is more  than 0.75  mile from  the  Presbyterian  Senior  Center.   During   an  inspection  of   the  broadcast station, a maintenance department employee informed the  agents that the  Presbyterian Senior Center  subscribed to an  FM  broadcast service on the frequencies  98.9 MHz, 102.9 MHz,  103.9  MHz and 106.3 MHz called ``Companion Radio.''  Networx  installed  and operated the  four broadcast systems  at different  locations  throughout the  Presbyterian  Senior  Center  to  provide  signal  coverage.  The broadcast stations were located in Room 4601, Room  053, the Tower Stairs on  the third floor, and  in a closet of  a  rear building.  At each of  the four locations, Networx  operated  broadcast station  transmitters on  the  four frequencies  for  a  total of 16 stations.            4.   Radio  stations  in  the   FM  broadcast  band,   i.e.,  broadcast stations that  transmit on a  frequency between 88  and  108 MHz, must be licensed by the FCC (47 U.S.C.  301).  The only  exception to this licensing requirement in the FM broadcast  band  is  for   certain  non-licensed   low-power  radio   transmitters  operating at a power level  that complies with Section 15.239  of  the Commission's Rules  (``Rules'').2  This  section limits  such  transmitters to the field strength of  250 mV/m at a distance  of  three meters from the transmitting antenna.  If a station exceeds  the limits specified  in Section  15.239 of the  Rules, then  the  operator must obtain a license prior to operating the station.          5.   On January  12,  2002,  the agents  used  a  calibrated  Potomac FIM-71 Field  Strength Meter to  conduct measurements  of  the signals from  the broadcast stations.   The agents  conducted  their measurements at the intersection of 12th Street and  Hulton  Road at a distance of over  300 feet from the station located  in  Room 053  of the  Presbyterian Senior  Center.  The  measurements  indicated field strengths of 976 mV/m on the frequency 98.9  MHz,  1,135 mV/m on the frequency 102.9 MHz, 972 mV/m on the  frequency  103.9 MHz and 1,056 mV/m on the frequency 106.3 MHz.  The  agents  used extrapolation  to  calculate  the field  strength  at  three  meters  from  the   broadcast  stations  in   Room  053  of   the  Presbyterian Senior Center.  The broadcast stations exceeded  the  permissible level  for a  non-licensed radio  transmitter by  119  times on the frequency 98.9 MHz, 138 times on the frequency 102.9  MHz, 119 times on  the frequency 103.9 MHz  and 129 times on  the  frequency 106.3 MHz.  Accordingly, a license was required for the  operation of the broadcast  stations.  Based on the  Commission's  records, no license had been issued  for the operation of any  FM  broadcast station at this location.  Thus, Networx was  operating  the stations without a license, in violation of 47 U.S.C.  301.       6.   On January 22, 2002, the Philadelphia Office sent,  via  certified    mail,    a     letter    addressed    to     Networx  Corporation/Companion Radio, 1 Fishers Road, Pittsford, New  York  14534.  The letter  warned the  addressee that  operation of  the  unlicensed radio stations on the frequencies 98.9 MHz, 102.9 MHz,  103.9 MHz  and  106.3  MHz at  the  Presbyterian  Senior  Center,  violated Section 301 of the Act; outlined the potential penalties  for operating the unlicensed stations in violation of Section 301  of the  Act,  including  seizure  of  the  equipment,  fines  and  imprisonment;  and  directed  the  operator  of  the  station  to  terminate operation of the unlicensed stations immediately.   The  Philadelphia Office requested Networx  submit a written  response  within 10 days of receipt of the letter.       7.   By letter  dated  February  1,  2002,  Ken  Unger,  the  President of Networx,  submitted a response  to the  Philadelphia  Office.   He  acknowledged  that  they  operated  four  broadcast  systems  at  the  Presbyterian  Senior  Center,  each  of   which  transmitted on the frequencies 98.9 MHz, 102.9 MHz, 103.9 MHz and  106.3 MHz.  He stated that  based on field strength  measurements  that it conducted on January 23, 2002, it does appear that one or  more transmitters were  generating field strengths  in excess  of  the maximum  allowed.  He  stated that  they had  already  ceased  operation of all the stations at the Presbyterian Senior  Center.   He also  stated  that  they  would place  the  stations  back  in  operation only after appropriate  measurements have been made  on  each  transmitter  individually   and  modifications  have   been  implemented to  reduce the  field strength  of any  non-compliant  transmitter to the parameters specified in Section 15.239 of  the  Rules.                               III.  DISCUSSION       8.   Section 301 of the Act prohibits any person from  using  or operating  any apparatus  for the  transmission of  energy  or  communications or signals by radio except under and in accordance  with the Act and with a license in that behalf granted under  the  provisions of the  Act.  On  January 12,  2002, Networx  operated  four FM broadcast  stations on  the frequencies  98.9 MHz,  102.9  MHz, 103.9 MHz  and 106.3  MHz in  Room 053  of the  Presbyterian  Senior Center without  a license.   Networx would  not have  been  required to  obtain a  license  to operate  the stations  if  the  signal strengths  did  not exceed  the  FCC limits  specified  in  Section 15.239 of the Rules.   However, on January 12, 2002,  the  agents measured  that  the  signal  strengths  of  the  broadcast  stations exceeded the FCC limits by at least 119 times.         9.   By letter  dated  October 30,  2000,  the  Philadelphia  Office warned Networx that its  operation of a broadcast  station  at the Dunwoody Village in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania without a  license was in violation of Section  301 of the Act.  The  agents  found that  the  station at  the  Dunwoody Village  exceeded  the  limits specified in Section 15.239  of the Rules and Networx  did  not have a  license to operate  the station.  Therefore,  Networx  was aware  prior to  January 12,  2002 of  its responsibility  to  properly measure,  adjust  and  maintain  all  of  its  broadcast  stations to avoid  subsequent violations  of Section  301 of  the  Act.        10.  Based on the evidence before  us, we find that  Networx  apparently willfully3 and repeatedly4 violated Section 301 of the  Act.  The Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and  Amendment  of Section  1.80  of  the Rules  to  Incorporate  the  Forfeiture  Guidelines, 12 FCC Rcd 17087, 17113 (1997), recon. denied, 15 FCC  Rcd 303 (1999) (``Forfeiture Policy Statement'')5, sets the  base  forfeiture  amount  for  unlicensed  operation  at  $10,000.   In  assessing the  monetary  forfeiture  amount, we  must  take  into  account the statutory factors  set forth in Section  503(b)(2)(D)  of the Act,6 which include the nature, circumstances, extent, and  gravity of the violation, and  with respect to the violator,  the  degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability  to  pay, and other such matters as justice may require.  Applying the  Forfeiture Policy  Statement and  the  statutory factors  to  the  instant case and applying  the inflation adjustments, we  believe  that a  ten  thousand  dollar ($10,000)  monetary  forfeiture  is  warranted.                        IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       11.  Accordingly, IT IS  ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of the  Act7 and  Sections 0.111,  0.311 and  1.80 of  the  Rules8 Networx is hereby NOTIFIED of its APPARENT LIABILITY FOR A  FORFEITURE in the  amount of ten  thousand dollars ($10,000)  for  willfully and repeatedly violating Section 301 of the Act.          12.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of  the Rules, within thirty days of the release date of this  NOTICE  OF APPARENT  LIABILITY, Networx  Corporation SHALL  PAY the  full  amount of  the  proposed  forfeiture  or  SHALL  FILE  a  written  statement seeking  reduction  or  cancellation  of  the  proposed  forfeiture.       13.  Payment of  the forfeiture  may be  made by  mailing  a  check or similar instrument, payable to the order of the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois 60673-7482.  The payment should note the  NAL/Acct. No. 200232400008, and FRN 0006-0222-97.        14.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications  Commission,  Enforcement  Bureau,  Technical  and  Public Safety Division, 445  12th Street, S.W., Washington,  D.C.  20554 and MUST INCLUDE THE NAL/Acct. No. 200232400008.        15.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.       16.  Requests for payment of the full amount of this  Notice  of Apparent Liability  under an installment  plan should be  sent  to: Chief,  Revenue and  Receivables Operations  Group, 445  12th  Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.9       17.

INTRODUCTION       1.   In this  Notice of  Apparent Liability  for  Forfeiture  (``NAL''), we find Piedmont Radio Co., licensee of radio  station  WPID, Piedmont,  Alabama, and  owner of  an unregistered  antenna  structure  near  Piedmont,  Alabama,  apparently  liable  for   a  forfeiture in the  amount of ten  thousand dollars ($10,000)  for  willful and repeated violation of Sections 73.1125(a) and 17.4(a)  of the Commission's  Rules (``Rules'').1   Specifically, we  find  Piedmont Radio  Co.  apparently  liable  for  not  maintaining  a  presence at  its main  studio during  normal business  hours  and  failing to register its antenna structure.                           II.  BACKGROUND       2.   On June 26, 2002, at 1:45 P.M. local time, and again at  3:50 P.M. local time, an agent of the Commission's Atlanta  Field  Office (``Atlanta  Office'')  attempted an  inspection  of  radio  station WPID's main  studio located  at the  transmitter site  in  Piedmont, Alabama.  The main studio office doors were locked  and  no lights were visible.   There were no  office hours denoted  on  the doors and no  indication of why the  office was closed.   The  agent called the listed telephone  numbers for WPID and  received  no answer.        3.   On June  26,  2002,  the agent  inspected  the  antenna  structure of WPID(AM) located at or near geographical coordinates  33 55' 45'' North Latitude by  085 35' 42'' West Longitude,  in  Piedmont, Alabama.2   The  structure was over  200 feet tall  and  was painted  and lighted.  The agent  checked the  FCC's  Antenna  Structure Registration records  and determined  that the  antenna  structure was not registered with the FCC.       4.   On July 16,  2002, at  9:40 A.M. and  10:55 A.M.  local  time, the  agent again  telephoned the  station and  received  no  answer.  On August  21, 2002, at  1:23 P.M. and  3:30 P.M.  local  time, the  agent again  telephoned the  station and  received  no  answer.       5.   On August 26, 2002, the agent reached the owner of WPID  by telephone who verified that  the antenna structure of WPID  is  owned by the licensee, Piedmont Radio Co., and that the structure  was not registered with the  Commission. The station license  for  WPID requires that the antenna  structure be painted and  lighted  since it is over 200 feet tall.  The owner also verified that the  studio of WPID is not staffed during normal business hours.                         III.      DISCUSSION       6.  Section 73.1125(a) requires the licensee of a  broadcast  station to  maintain  a  main  studio at  one  of  the  following  locations:  (1) within the station's community of license; (2) at  any location within  the principal community  contour of any  AM,  FM, or TV broadcast station  licensed to the station's  community  of license; or  (3) within twenty-five  miles from the  reference  coordinates of  the  center  of its  community  of  license.   In  adopting  the  main  studio  rules,  the  Commission   explicitly  informed permittees and licensees  that compliance with the  main  studio rules  required  maintenance  of a  meaningful  staff  and  management presence,3 stating:             A station must  maintain a main  studio which  has       the capability  adequately  to meet  its  function,  as       discussed above, of serving the needs and interests  of       the residents of  the station's  community of  license.        To fulfill this function, a station must equip the main       studio with production and transmission facilities that       meet applicable standards, maintain continuous  program       transmission  capability,  and  maintain  a  meaningful       management  and   staff   presence.    Maintenance   of       production  and  transmission  capability  will   allow       broadcasters to continue, at  their option, and as  the       marketplace demands, to produce  local programs at  the       studio.  A  meaningful  management and  staff  presence       will help expose stations to community activities, help       them identify community needs and interests and thereby       meet their community service requirements.4  Subsequently, in  its  decision in  Jones  Eastern of  the  Outer  Banks, Inc.,5 the Commission further  clarified the concept of  a  meaningful  management  and   staff  presence.   The   Commission  specified that, at a minimum,  a main studio must maintain  full- time managerial and full-time  staff personnel.6  The  Commission  also stated that licensees  need not have  the same staff  person  and manager at the  studio, as long as  there was management  and  staff presence there during normal business hours.7  With respect  to management personnel,  the Commission  further clarified  that  they need not be ``chained to  their desks'' but that they  would  be required  to report  to work  at the  main studio  on a  daily  basis, spend a substantial amount of time there, and use the main  studio as their ``home base.''8  On June 26, 2002, Piedmont Radio  Co. did not maintain  a presence at the  main studio of  WPID(AM)  during normal  business hours.   The main  studio was  completely  unattended on June  26, 2002,  at 1:45  P.M. and  3:50 P.M  local  time.  On July  16 and August  21, 2002, there  was no answer  in  response to repeated telephone calls made during normal  business  hours to the listed telephone number for WPID(AM)'s main  studio.   Piedmont admitted that the WPID(AM) main studio was not staffed.       7.  Section 17.4(a) of  the Rules requires  the owner of  an  antenna structure that  required notice to  the Federal  Aviation  Administration (``FAA'') to register  the antenna structure  with  the Commission.  Piedmont Radio Co.'s antenna structure  required  FAA notification because  it exceeded 200  feet in height.9   Yet  Piedmont Radio Co. failed to register the structure.       8.  Based on the evidence before us, we find Piedmont  Radio  Co. willfully10 and repeatedly11 violated Sections 73.1125(a) and  17.4(a) of the  Rules by failing  to maintain a  presence at  the  main studio of WPID(AM) during normal business hours and  failing  to register its antenna structure.       9. Pursuant to Section 1.80(b)(4)  of the Rules,12 the  base  forfeiture amount for  violation of main  studio rules is  $7,000  and failing to  register the antenna  structure (failure to  file  required forms  or  information)  is $3,000.   In  assessing  the  monetary forfeiture amount,  we must also  take into account  the  statutory factors  set  forth  in  Section  503(b)(2)(D)  of  the  Communications Act of 1934,  as amended (``Act''), which  include  the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the  violation,  and with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability,  any  history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and other such matters  as justice  may require.13   Considering  the entire  record  and  applying the factors listed above,  this case warrants a  $10,000  forfeiture.                        IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES       10.  Accordingly, IT  IS ORDERED THAT,  pursuant to  Section  503(b) of the Act,14  and Sections 0.111, 0.311  and 1.80 of  the  Rules,15 Piedmont Radio Co. is  hereby NOTIFIED of this  APPARENT  LIABILITY FOR A FORFEITURE in the amount of ten thousand  dollars  ($10,000)  for  willful  and   repeated  violation  of   Sections  73.1125(a) and  17.4(a) of  the Rules  by failing  to maintain  a  presence at the  main studio of  WPID(AM) during normal  business  hours and failing to register its antenna structure.       11.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT, pursuant to Section 1.80 of  the Rules, within thirty  days of the release  date of this  NAL,  Piedmont Radio  Co. SHALL  PAY the  full amount  of the  proposed  forfeiture or SHALL FILE a written statement seeking reduction or  cancellation of the proposed forfeiture.       12.  Payment  of the  forfeiture may  be made  by mailing  a  check or similar instrument, payable to the order of the  Federal  Communications Commission, to the Forfeiture Collection  Section,  Finance  Branch,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  P.O.  Box  73482, Chicago, Illinois 60673-7482.  The payment should note the  NAL/Acct. No. and FRN referenced above.  Requests for payment  of  the full amount of this NAL  under an installment plan should  be  sent to:  Chief, Revenue  and Receivables  Operations Group,  445  12th Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.16       13.  The  response,  if  any,  must  be  mailed  to  Federal  Communications Commission,  Office  of the  Secretary,  445  12th  Street  SW,  Washington  DC  20554,  Attn:  Enforcement   Bureau- Technical & Public Safety Division and MUST INCLUDE THE NAL/Acct.  No. referenced above.         14.  The Commission will not consider reducing or  canceling  a forfeiture in response  to a claim of  inability to pay  unless  the petitioner  submits: (1)  federal tax  returns for  the  most  recent  three-year  period;  (2)  financial  statements  prepared  according to generally accepted accounting practices  (``GAAP'');  or (3)  some  other  reliable and  objective  documentation  that  accurately reflects  the petitioner's  current financial  status.   Any claim  of inability  to pay  must specifically  identify  the  basis for the claim by  reference to the financial  documentation  submitted.        15.  Under the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of  2002,  Pub L. No.  107-198, 116 Stat.  729 (June 28,  2002), the FCC  is  engaged in  a two-year  tracking process  regarding the  size  of  entities involved  in forfeitures.   If you  qualify as  a  small  entity and  if you  wish to  be  treated as  a small  entity  for  tracking purposes, please  so certify  to us  within thirty  (30)  days of this  NAL, either in  your response  to the NAL  or in  a  separate filing  to be  sent  to the  Technical &  Public  Safety  Division.   Your  certification  should  indicate  whether   you,  including your parent  entity and its  subsidiaries, meet one  of  the definitions  set forth  in  the list  provided by  the  FCC's  Office of Communications Business Opportunities (OCBO) set  forth  in Attachment  A  of this  Notice  of Apparent  Liability.   This  information will  be  used  for  tracking  purposes  only.   Your  response or  failure to  respond to  this question  will have  no  effect on your  rights and responsibilities  pursuant to  Section  503(b)  of  the  Communications  Act.   If  you  have   questions  regarding any  of  the  information contained  in  Attachment  A,  please contact OCBO at (202) 418-0990.        16.
