History  |   Work Portfolio  |  Highlights  |  Volpe Subsites  |  Journal Articles           Mobility History      From long distance air trips to local errands, Americans everywhere are on the move. The DOT has always recognized that mobility and accessibility are central functions of our transportation system.     The Volpe Center has supported DOT's efforts to ensure that the transportation system is accessible, integrated, efficient, and offers flexibility of choices. The Center's work on improving access to transportation can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s and continues today. The Center has been involved in efforts to improve mass transit and has demonstrated an expertise in evaluating innovative technologies. As the demand for air transportation has increased, the Center has provided the aviation community with forward-thinking support for modernization. The Center's innovative approach is demonstrated by its involvement with new and ""intelligent"" technologies to meet transportation demands.     Access for all Americans    Over the last 30 years there has been a welcome change in the national consciousness. Society now recognizes the importance of providing access to transportation for all citizens. As the population ages, there is a raised  awareness of the needs of the elderly and the desirability of providing them with viable transportation alternatives to the automobile. Many people live in the suburbs or in rural areas, which are not served by public transportation. People who used to be on welfare are now entering the work force. How can job accessibility be provided for these new workers and other low-income workers who often rely on public transport and must undertake hazarduous and complex journeys each day to get to work? How can access to transit for the disabled be improved? These are important national concerns.    The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act guarantees equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities. Removing barriers allows society to benefit more from the abilities and talents of disabled people. Since 1991, the Volpe Center has supported the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in implementing the transit-related requirements of this act. The Center's work has included technical reviews of paratransit plans, research and technology assessments, technical assistance and outreach products, and fact-finding site investigations.     In the 1970s and 1980s the FTA was already looking at ways to improve access to transit for disabled people and to encourage other innovations. The Volpe Center supported the FTA by conducting evaluations of ridesharing demonstration programs and studying paratransit systems such as dial-a-ride. Dial-a-ride transit is an on-demand service. Customers telephone their trip requests in advance to a dispatching center. Most riders live in low-density areas not served by fixed-route transit, but dial-a-ride transit may also serve elderly or disabled customers. Transit agencies have sought to increase the efficiency of dial-a-ride transit through the use of automated vehicle routing that would increase the number of riders per trip. Recently, the Volpe Center developed a system concept that uses off-the-shelf communications software to further automation. Known as Autonomous Dial-A-Ride-Transit (ADART), the technology provides on-board computers that decentralize and automate the dispatching function. Center researchers are working on a demonstration program in Corpus Christi, Texas.     The Volpe Center's work on increasing access to transportation has included evaluating how well transit systems meet the mobility needs of welfare recipients who must rely on public transportation to travel to their jobs. In support of DOT's Access to Jobs program, researchers at the Center used Geographic Information System technologies to correlate availability of transportation with the geographic distribution of people most in need of these services. This has enabled planners to determine the best means to provide job accessibility for welfare recipients and other low-income residents.     The Volpe Center also is conducting research on viable transportation alternatives for the nation's aging population. This research will enable policy makers to open a dialogue on how the transportation community provides mobility and access to that increasing portion of the nation's population who no longer can or want to operate an automobile.    Improvements to Mass Transit    The Volpe Center's support for the FTA started in the 1970s when it conducted evaluations of potential improvements to existing transit operations and technology.    Could ramps and lifts accommodate the needs of disabled riders? Was the introduction of reserved lanes for buses and carpools effective in lowering trip times? Were double-decker buses a viable option for increasing capacity on heavily traveled routes in major urban areas? As the FTA grappled with these and other issues, the Center developed an expertise in helping the agency evaluate new technologies and services. Working primarily to support the FTA's Service and Methods Demonstration Program, the Center continued to perform these evaluations in the 1970s and 1980s and thus established its reputation as an impartial technical resource.    Building on this work, the Volpe Center conducted evaluations of more advanced and innovative technologies for urban transit. The Center performed assessments of Automated Guideway transit systems and supported the implementation of a Personal Rapid Transit system that used driverless vehicles to connect campuses at the University of West Virginia in Morgantown. The Center was then able to provide the FTA with guidance when FTA launched the Downtown People Mover Project, through which driverless vehicles operated over exclusive guideways, in congested downtown areas such as Los Angeles, St. Paul, Detroit, and Miami. The technical guidance included engineering evaluations, advice on supplier selection, and a socioeconomic assessment of the program.     Air Transport Efficiency    The nation's air traffic continues to increase dramatically. In 1970, 170 million people traveled the world's airways. By 1999, that figure had grown to 635 million people. As demand for air transportation has increased, a number of problems--from insufficient capacity to delays--have arisen. That there is no one solution is demonstrated by the range of projects where the Volpe Center has worked with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase airport capacity and to minimize delays and congestion.    In the 1970s, wake vortices--air turbulence produced by large jets when taking off and landing--necessitated increased separations between aircraft and thus led to a new constraint on airport capacity. The Volpe Center provided research support to the FAA in understanding wake vortices so that the real separation requirements could be determined and factored into airport operations.     More than a decade ago, the Center developed the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) to assist air traffic management specialists in minimizing air traffic delays and congestion as well as ensuring smooth and efficient air traffic flow. The system integrates real-time flight and weather data from multiple sources and presents information graphically in a highly adaptable and easy-to-understand format, alerting controllers to circumstances likely to produce congestion. The Center continues to enhance this system, while also playing an important role in the Collaborative Decision Making Program, which is aimed at improving information exchange among air traffic controllers, flight crews, and airline operations centers.    Today, the Volpe Center continues to support the FAA as it works to improve the ability of the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet increased demand for air travel. The NAS is an ongoing modernization effort intended to provide increased benefits to all users through new technologies, operational changes, and collaboration among users and providers. One major element of the NAS modernization is the implementation of Free Flight: a system concept that will, whenever practical and safe, remove the restrictions imposed by the existing air traffic system and allow pilots to choose their own preferred route and speed. FAA and the aviation industry are cooperating in the Safe Flight 21 Program, which will demonstrate and evaluate how communications, navigation, and surveillance technologies can support the introduction of Free Flight. The Volpe Center provides advanced surface surveillance data fusion and sensor processing systems in support of Safe Flight 21 demonstration activities at the Memphis International Airport in Tennessee and the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky.    New Opportunities with ITS    Across the country, from advanced traffic control to freeway management systems and ""smart cards,"" state and local agencies are applying Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies and methods to meet tough transportation challenges. In 1992, the Center assisted the DOT in the formation of the ITS Joint Program Office, which oversees funding and implementation of local programs. The core principle of ITS is integrating technologies, transportation modes, and programs to create a better functioning overall system. Overcoming institutional barriers has presented one of the greatest challenges. Like computer technology in the 1980s, ITS requires individuals and organizations to think and function differently, if its benefits are to be realized. The Center has examined institutional systems and relationships, and identified ways to support the changes necessary to continue ITS expansion. The Center also has been involved in the major effort to develop National ITS Architecture and Standards, which will be central to federal policy on integrating systems and programs.     By encouraging the interoperability of systems throughout the country, these standards will facilitate and support widespread implementation of ITS technologies and applications.    The Volpe Center has assisted the DOT ITS Joint Program Office in many activities related to design, management, and performance of that program. It has also been actively involved in many specific implementation projects. As an example, the State of Maryland was experiencing paralyzing roadway congestion resulting from a booming economy and a growing population. Use of the state highway system had increased by 60 percent over the past 20 years. State transportation planners projected that the future growth in traffic would outpace any realistic hope of expanding capacity solely through the construction or expansion of roadways. With help from the Volpe Center, Maryland has developed a comprehensive ITS strategy to increase the efficiency of the existing road network. In looking for innovative solutions, the state has allowed communications firms to locate facilities, such as fiber-optic cables, within a highway right-of-way in exchange for communication infrastructure or services to the state ITS network.     The Volpe Center is also assisting a number of states and local communities in developing and implementing smart card systems. Smart cards, or electronic payment systems, allow transit users to store their fares on a single card instead of searching for exact change or dealing with tokens. Because eliminating cash transactions can significantly reduce the administrative and accounting costs of fare collection, transit providers throughout the country are looking at making smart cards the basis of cashless fare systems. For example, students attending Cleveland State University can use the same card to buy lunch and use the transit system. By evaluating technology costs and transportation impacts the Volpe Center is supporting the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority and Cleveland State University in these kinds of experiments with multi-use cards. Smart cards can also be used to pay for tolls, parking, and other transportation services.    The Center is helping other transportation organizations, such as the Virginia Department of Transportation, to evaluate the benefits of multimodal electronic payment systems that combine transit fares, highway tolls, and parking fees. The Center's work on paratransit systems continues by providing technical support to the City of Los Angeles in implementing an electronic payment system for paratransit clients.     The Volpe Center is involved in educating and communicating the benefits of new technologies. For the FTA's Advanced Public Transportation Systems, the Volpe Center has developed a Mobile Showcase, a ""traveling classroom,"" that tours the country and demonstrates transit-related ITS initiatives to encourage their adoption at the local level. The showcase has provided a forum for the exchange of information and for developing productive relationships with other organizations through such vehicles as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements.    Transportation Alternatives    Various initiatives across the country are examining high-speed rail systems as a method to provide quick, affordable transportation alternatives to crowded highways and airways. The Center supports the Federal Railroad Association's (FRA) Next Generation High-Speed Rail Technology Demonstration Program, which was established in 1994 to encourage state transportation authorities to adapt existing technologies and upgrade rail lines in order to handle high-speed trains. Currently, several states are planning high-speed rail systems and making necessary improvements. The Volpe Center supports these efforts by performing economic analyses and investigating methods for improving the system as well as helping to set minimum safety standards for mixing high-speed passenger and freight operations. In a related area, the Center has been working with the FRA to study and develop technologies such as positive train control and high-speed grade crossing protection.     The Center's support for alternative technologies started in the 1970s, when the Center was involved in testing a magnetic levitation (maglev) system at the Pueblo High Speed Ground Test Center, in Colorado. Maglev technology uses electromagnetic forces to lift, propel, and guide a vehicle over specially designed guideways, allowing for high-speed, energy-efficient transportation. The Volpe Center is currently supporting the FRA in a deployment program where the FRA plans to develop and construct an operational maglev public transportation system. The Center's support consists of preparing Environmental Impact Statements for the technology, and serving on the technical advisory panel that will choose where the first maglev system will be deployed.    The future of high-speed rail transportation depends on its economic viability and convenience. In 1990, the Center identified and characterized costs and benefits of improvements that could be achieved in commuter and intercity rail service on the Northeast Corridor, stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C. Jointly sponsored by FTA and the FRA, the Volpe study clarified cost and trip-time benefits that could be obtained through major investments in the Boston-New York rail infrastructure. This information provided a basis for developing a consensus among owners, operators, and all levels of government. This work also was a key element in shaping the plans now being implemented by federal and state agencies and Amtrak to achieve frequent and reliable 3-hour Boston-New York service.    Future Mobility Needs     In 1997, the transportation network supported 4.6 trillion passenger-miles of personal transportation and approximately 4 trillion ton-miles of freight movement. Industry and government predictions confirm that local and long-distance travel will continue to grow as a result of greater vehicle availability, reduced travel costs, population increases, an expanding economy, and higher consumer incomes. The Volpe Center will continue to assess the needs of transportation systems and bring together the necessary technologies for improving mobility and accessibility.       Economic Growth History    Throughout history, the introduction of new modes of transport and other innovations in transportation technology have encouraged commercial activity and economic growth.     The DOT has the broad goal of ensuring a comprehensive and integrated transportation system that meets the needs of citizens and businesses, and that keeps our economy competitive on a world scale. The Volpe Center has provided substantial support to this mission over the last 30 years, solving problems and maximizing opportunities in all modes of transportation. The Center's activities and expertise have helped to maintain a reliable, efficient, and modern transportation system--a critical lifeline that keeps the U.S. economy strong and vibrant.    Crisis and Opportunity in the 1970s    The energy crisis of the mid-1970s presented the Center with an opportunity to address difficult challenges and to define a key role in supporting the nation's economic interests. Because the United States is strongly dependent on foreign oil, the decision by oil exporting countries to raise prices and limit supplies sent shock waves throughout the American economy. It appeared that the nation could be held hostage by oil producing foreign countries. The government quickly mobilized to explore approaches to address long-term economic problems presented by these realities. The Motor Vehicle Goals (MVG) Program involved the DOT and the U.S. Department of Energy in a national review of the oil and auto industries. The program examined a variety of issues ranging from oil dependency and pricing to automobile manufacturing techniques and industry competitiveness. The Volpe Center provided significant support to the program by conducting detailed economic research and analysis on the automobile industry.    In light of the new market dynamics for oil, decreasing the country's fuel consumption figured prominently in federal economic policy. In 1975, Congress established fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. The goal was to increase average fuel efficiency of new American-built cars to 27.5 miles per gallon over a 10-year time frame. To ensure this final standard would be met, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed a set of incremental standards to measure the industry's progress.     Improving vehicle fuel efficiency would require major changes in design and manufacturing. Building upon the studies it conducted for the MVG Program, the Volpe Center supported NHTSA in developing realistic incremental standards that would be technically and economically feasible for the automotive industry. Excessively aggressive requirements could have serious consequences for the industry, and could result in decreased raw steel sales, regional pockets of high unemployment, and other potential impacts. Because the standard macroeconomic analysis model would not identify all these effects, the Volpe team conducted a more comprehensive and systematic analysis. This approach included a wide variety of activities ranging from technical feasibility studies of vehicle manufacturing, to assessments of shifting U.S. consumer demand, to the identification of broad national policy and economic concerns.    By examining all the various integrated factors, the Volpe Center developed a detailed picture of the wide-ranging impacts of fuel efficiency initiatives. It became an acknowledged expert in automotive economic research, and served as a communication bridge between government and the industry to facilitate the development of acceptable incremental fuel efficiency standards. The Center's analysis was also considered by the federal government in its decision to provide an unprecedented loan guarantee to the Chrysler Corporation, one of the nation's ""Big Three"" automakers that, by the late 1970s, sank into bankruptcy due to industry and market changes.      In addition to this keynote analysis of the automotive and fuel issues, during its first 10 years, the Volpe Center conducted socioeconomic and engineering studies for all modes of transportation. Emerging computer technology proved to be a valuable tool for these efforts, and Center staff developed computerized information systems to serve the needs of Volpe analysts and engineers. The systems greatly facilitated modeling and simulation activities conducted for various studies, providing enhanced capabilities and performance.     While the Volpe Center began work in the 1970s by providing internal support to the DOT's ongoing initiatives, its contributions to the national response to the energy crisis demonstrated the sensitivity of the Center's activities to external factors. This trend would continue as a technological revolution took place in the next decade.    Technology Changes the World of Work     In the 1980s, computer technology hit the workplace. Both government and private industry quickly moved to take advantage of the power and productivity and enhancement potential of inexpensive desktop computers, driven by continued improvements in computing speed and storage capacity.    Over the last two decades, the immense economic value of the revolution in Information Technology (IT) has been demonstrated in all segments of our society. Computers hold great value for information-rich organizations such as government agencies, allowing them to manage their work with greater efficiency and accuracy. To reap these benefits, many agencies sought to incorporate IT and Management Information Systems (MIS) in their operations.     Responding to this broad demand, the Volpe Center expanded its IT work to develop systems for external clients ranging from desktop office automation to major mainframe applications. During this time, the Volpe Center developed a reputation for its ability to identify and address the diverse operational needs of clients and relate them to the offerings of the IT marketplace. The Center's activities covered a broad spectrum from custom software development, system deployment, and staff training to Local Area Network installation and telecommunications management.     The Center became known for its ability to analyze new technologies and to help clients understand how they could best be utilized, how they would impact users and field operations, and how systems could be integrated across agencies.     The Volpe Center worked on numerous IT initiatives in the 1980s, and provided significant support to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in this area. Beginning in 1983 and in support of the National Airspace System (NAS), the Center provided analysis, development, deployment, and training to the FAA on information management tools such as the Telecommunications Information Management System.  This system automates the management of acquisition, inventory, and billing processes associated with the FAA's telecommunications assets.    More recently, the Center has supported the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) under the National Transit Database (NTD) Project in developing software to apportion over $3 billion annually to urban areas for public transit service.  The apportionment involves a formula with factors based on public transit service and productivity.  The Center provides a range of support to FTA projects to assist in developing the usefulness of the NTD to planners, policy makers, and industry researchers.  The NTD is used to improve the management and operations of the over 500 U.S. public transit systems.      The move to incorporate wide-scale computer use into government operations was broad and swift. IT had become critical to organizations' economic performance, and work in this area has since expanded to cover a wide spectrum of applications. For example, the Center recently developed an Environmental MIS to assist the U.S. Postal Service in managing its environmental conservation efforts. This system supports cost-effective approaches to protecting the environment.    While computers provided tangible benefits, the technology was complex and presented serious new challenges. Computers not only changed the way people worked, they changed the way organizations functioned. To ensure that technology was successfully integrated into the workplace, the Volpe Center expanded its activities into the new realm of organizational development.Working with the Federal Highway Administration and FTA, the Volpe Center crafted a clear and uniform perspective on the use of technology in transit and transportation planning. In the early 1980s the Center produced a series of reports on microcomputers in transportation, that were distributed to state, regional, and local transportation organizations. Designed to help them be smart consumers of technology, the publications emphasized the need to consider organizational and technological issues. They also provided guidance to the organizations for developing sound technology application strategies.    One of the Center's major efforts during this period was with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Each year the military moves thousands of personnel and tons of material around the world, increasingly utilizing the civil transportation system. But accommodating the unique requirements of military transport sometimes put a strain on commercial carriers. The challenge intensified during the 1980s, when the DoD began shifting to a much greater reliance on civil transportation resources, soon becoming the world's largest user of the civil system.    Working with the Logistics Directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Volpe Center conducted transportation logistics studies to determine more effective ways to coordinate military usage of civil transportation. These studies were critical to the DoD's formation of the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM). Operating as a single defense transportation system manager, with control over multi-modal military and civil resources, TRANSCOM marked a significant commitment by the DoD toward greater cooperation between military and civil interests. The Volpe Center provided ongoing support to TRANSCOM by helping them to integrate military concerns with changes in the civil transportation system. This enhanced coordination provided more reliable, cost- effective, and efficient military use of civil transportation resources, which in turn allowed these systems to appropriately serve ongoing civilian and commercial needs.    The growth of containerized shipping in the United States in the 1980s presented a challenge for the DoD, as it did for all freight carriers. Loading large, closed containers with goods at a point of origin and transporting them via ship, rail, and truck offered marked improvements in efficiency and cost-savings. But containerized shipping presented problems for tracking and monitoring freight throughout the shipping cycle. Computer technology presented one of the solutions. For the military, the Volpe Center developed software that used Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and radio frequency tag systems to track both containers and their content. These technologies are now being used for commercial applications worldwide. The widespread use of freight containers has had a profound impact on the global economy by reducing the time it takes to ship freight and dramatically reducing the cost.     By assisting DOT agencies in deploying IT systems--and by working to fully integrate the technology through addressing various strategic, organizational, and human factors, the Volpe Center, in the 1980s, helped to significantly improve the performance and effectiveness of transportation planning and operations. This work ensured that our transportation system would be prepared to respond to future changes. The Center's reputation for encouraging innovative technologies made it a prime candidate to implement DOT's highly competitive Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. Established in 1982 in 11 different government agencies, the SBIR program encouraged small businesses to undertake high-tech research, by providing ""seed money"" to foster commercialization of innovative technologies and ideas. DOT's SBIR program has been successful in encouraging the technical creativity of the private sector, and Volpe has established a relationship of trust with the participants.    Global Growth and Expansion     The last decade of the 20th century saw continuing growth and expansion in the U.S. economy. The lowering of trade barriers around the world opened new markets, creating a truly global economy. In addition, the U.S. population continued to increase. These changing market and social dynamics presented challenges to all modes of transportation, as the demand for timely and efficient service began to tax the existing limits of the various modal systems.     Much of the Volpe Center's work during the 1990s centered on bolstering the performance and capacity of the transportation system, to help ensure a high level of mobility across the country and around the world. Continued modernization and enhancement of traffic management operations was a key strategy for achieving this goal. Optimizing and improving the current systems is essential to the continued growth of both the U.S. and the global economy. The Center has been involved in improving traffic management systems for both aviation and shipping.     The steady rise in air traffic over the past 10 years has had a major impact on the global economy, and as the global economy expanded so too did the demands on the air transportation system. Airports across the country are trying to handle an increasing number of flights, but the skies and runways are reaching capacity. The Center has worked closely with the FAA to mitigate these problems. The Center's role in developing and implementing the Enhanced Traffic Management System, which helps air traffic controllers manage the flow of thousands of daily flights, has had a continuing positive effect on the efficiency of the National Air Space, and has been a critical building block for the FAA in modernizing the system.     Maritime shipping lanes also needed to improve their traffic management capabilities. One innovative approach to achieving this involves the application of GPS technology. The highly accurate position information provided by GPS technology makes it ideal for assisting navigation through shipping channels. When large cargo ships must traverse narrow waterways, the careful scheduling and navigation of their passage is critical to maximizing efficiency. The Center had a critical role in developing a GPS-based navigation system first for the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and subsequently for the Panama Canal Commission. Both systems have allowed more accurate scheduling, shorter transit times and lower shipping costs with a resulting positive impact on both economic growth and trade.     A fully functioning, global free-market economy requires the efficient movement of people and goods between countries. The number of people entering the United States at air and seaports and land-based border crossings may soon exceed 500 million per year. The Volpe Center's work on facilitating border crossings, without compromising national security, is featured in the article on National Security in this issue of the Volpe Journal.    The future economic growth of the United States is dependent on the ability of policy makers to formulate a vision of the transportation needs of the future and to anticipate the use of advanced technologies in the transportation arena. The ability to expand roadways to address congestion has become limited by geographic realities and environmental considerations. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are designed to enhance mobility through a combination of technology, programs, and policies. ITS includes a range of technology from variable message signs on roadways, to in-vehicle navigation systems using GPS technology. But the focus is not limited to roadways. ITS initiatives also include transit, motor carriers, and rail as elements of achieving the goal of a fully integrated transportation system.    Federal legislation passed in 1991 gave greater autonomy to state and local transportation officials. Since then the Volpe Center has had an opportunity to work with states and municipalities in areas that directly affect economic growth and trade. The State of New Mexico entered into a partnership with the Center to evaluate the economic benefits of a new approach to road building. Several other states and local authorities have turned to the Volpe Center for assistance in implementing new technologies. For example, the Center has collaborated with state and local agencies in the implementation of ""smart cards,"" the technology that stores value and information on wallet-sized cards and allows users to pay for goods and services or enter controlled areas.     Future Economic Growth    The last 30 years have illustrated the degree to which transportation is affected by changes in technology, social trends, government policy, and organizational philosophy. The Volpe Center has continually demonstrated its agility in addressing change, challenges, and opportunities. A key factor in the Center's success is an emphasis on continued learning. Each project allows the Center to continually build upon what it has learned, and to carry that knowledge into future work.     Innovation in transportation requires an educated and motivated workforce, and the Center strongly supports the development of future talent. The Garrett A. Morgan Technology and Transportation Futures Program provides an educational link between America's youth and transportation professionals to foster an interest in transportation careers, and will help ensure that the country's 21st century transportation workforce is technologically literate and internationally competitive. Federal, state, and local government agencies, education professionals, industry leaders and others who share a deep interest in improving the skills and abilities of students have formed a public-private partnership, known as the Career Cluster Transportation, Distribution, and Logisitics Initiative. This initiative builds on the success of the Garrett A. Morgan Program, and encourages and helps students who may be pursuing a career in transportation, distribution, and logistics.    The Volpe Center also contributes to programs in continuing education directed toward the current transportation workforce. The recent introduction of advanced technologies is transforming the demands made on the transportation professionals. These technologies provide transportation professionals with the tools to manage, operate, and maintain transportation systems in real time. It has become more critical than ever for transportation professionals at all levels to be trained in these technologies, and to understand their benefits and impacts on transportation systems and networks. In response, the DOT established the ITS Professional Capacity Building Program (PCB) in 1996 to provide training and education on these new information and communication technologies. Since the inception of the ITS PCB Program, the Volpe Center has worked closely with the ITS PCB Program Coordinator to design and implement a comprehensive, nationwide program to train and educate transportation professionals.    The explosive growth in the use of the Internet, e-commerce, and wireless communication in the last several years has set enormous changes in motion. Work practices and commuting patterns are changing, as are shopping and distribution models. The Volpe Center has already begun working on ways to address these issues.     The dramatic growth in the power and deployment of information technology and e-commerce has transformed the global supply chain. The Volpe Center is working with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and DOT's Office of the Secretary to capture the implications of alternative scenarios such as shifting freight transport from rail and marine carriers to the nation's roadways. This work will help industry as it develops more efficient pricing mechanisms to ensure the continued viability of the U.S. intermodal freight network as e-commerce usage increases.    As satellite networks and our dependence on them expand, and with the International Space Station's deployment supporting the prospect of future space-based manufacturing, the space transportation sector can only grow. The Center is providing technical support to the FAA's Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation. The Office plays a major role in the preparation of required environmental documentation for new commercial launch vehicles, facilities, and operations. The Center also has been working with the new Spaceport Florida Authority to support the state's efforts to maximize the economic potential of its space industry.     The Center's comprehensive, multi-modal expertise positions it to address the challenges and opportunities of the future. The work of the Volpe Center will continue to contribute to ensuring that transportation will support the economic vitality of our nation.

GX098-60-13923925	"MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SECURES $950,000 FOR METROWEST COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION                     DECEMBER 4, 2001                   WASHINGTON, DC -- Today, U.S. Congressmen Marty Meehan, Jim McGovern, Richard Neal, and Edward Markey joined U.S. Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry in announcing that $450,000 in funding for the MetroWest Community Transportation Pilot Project (CTPP) has been successfully secured along with $500,000 to establish a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The funding is included in the fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations Conference Report, which will go on to the White House for the President’s signature.     The purpose of the CTPP is to build a model of effective community-based, grassroots, participatory transportation planning that can address the specific needs of low-income communities.  The services provided by the CTPP will afford low-income individuals access to transportation in the Metrowest region.    ""The delegation worked well together to secure this important community transportation funding for the Metrowest region.  The Metrowest region needs these funds for residents and commuters that want to get to work but currently have limited transportation options. This innovative program will have a far- reaching impact on regional transportation planning,"" Congressman Meehan said.   “I am very pleased that we were able to obtain funding for this project,” said Congressman McGovern.  “This project is a great way to reach out to the less fortunate members of the Metrowest community and connect them with employment centers, job training, childcare, social services, and a host of other resources.  This project is extremely innovative and has far reaching implications for transportation planning.”   “I’m pleased we were able to obtain funds for this needed initiative to help our communities deal with the consequences of sprawl,” Senator Kennedy said. “Rapid growth has put excessive pressure on local traffic patterns, these transit improvements are essential to both the economy and the environment of the region. Increased use of mass transit will also significantly reduce auto emissions and improve air quality across the state.""   Senator Kerry said, ""Securing federal investment for critical transportation needs in the MetroWest area is a victory for our congressional delegation. This funding is a major step towards making  public transportation in the area more accessible and environmentally sound -- a must for this growing community.""   Congressman Neal said, “The CTPP program will be guided locally by community based organizations, who will work closely with the staff of the Metro Southwest regional employment board, and the project management staffs from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Metrowest/495 Transportation Management Association.   The CTPP program will be guided locally by community-based organizations, who will work closely with the staff of the Metro Southwest regional employment board and the project management staffs from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Metrowest/495 Transportation Management Association.    Additionally, the state is currently completing a study to examine the feasibility of creating a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The study is anticipated to support the creation of a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The federal funding will facilitate the establishment and implementation of a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority -- specifically supporting the development of efficient bus routes and schedules; procurement and contracting for bus services, drivers, and vehicles; establishment of shuttle service between employment areas and new commuter rail stations; and site search and procurement of bus garage sites, among other activities.   “I am very pleased that we were able to secure funding to establish a MetroWest Regional Transit Authority.” Meehan said.   “The influx of high-tech companies and new employees has revealed a need for improvements in regional transportation. We must work together to provide the infrastructure to support continued growth and economic development while protecting our environment.  The proposed regional transit authority would help relieve the strain on local roads and highways while improving the quality of life in the area.”   Rep. Markey said, “I am pleased with the transportation conference report that provides $500,000 for the MetroWest RTA to develop a regional mass transportation strategy and system.  The tremendous economic and population growth experienced by the MetroWest area over the past decade has pushed our transportation infrastructure to the brink.  The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring that this infrastructure keeps pace with growth. I am enthusiastic about the approach being taken by the member communities of the MetroWest RTA and am pleased that this vision will now be realized.  I look forward to continuing to work with the MetroWest RTA to meet the changing transportation needs of the area, and to ensure its continued prosperity.”          Next                                                            Previous                News Release List"

Beware  many common items used every day in the home or workplace may seem harmless; however, when transported by air, they can be very dangerous.  In flight, variations in temperature and pressure can cause items to leak, generate toxic fumes or start a fire.                   Personal care items containing hazardous materials (e.g., flammable perfume, aerosols) more than 70 ounces may be carried on board. Contents of each container may not exceed 16 fluid ounces.                   Matches and lighters may only be carried on your person.  However, strike-anywhere matches, lighters with flammable liquid reservoirs, and lighter fluid are forbidden.                   Firearms and ammunition may not be carried by a passenger on an aircraft. However, unloaded firearms may be transported in checked baggage if declared to the agent at check in and packed in a suitable container. Handguns must be in a locked container.  Boxed small arms ammunition for personal use may be transported in checked luggage. Amounts may vary depending on the airline.                   Dry ice (4 pounds or less) for packing perishables, may be carried on board an aircraft provided the package is vented.                   Electric wheelchairs must be transported in accordance with airline requirements.  The battery may need to be disconnected, removed, and the terminals insulated to prevent short circuits.

Return to        top                        Baggage and Packing           Many problems associated with checking your baggage can be solved before you leave for the airport.  It is recommended that the following items be packed into a carry-on bag:                  Small valuables (cash, credit cards, jewelry, cameras, personal computers)    Critical items (medicine, keys, passport, business papers)         Irreplaceable items (manuscripts, heirlooms)         Fragile Items (eyeglasses, liquids, glass containers)                          These items should be carried personally or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit under your seat on the plane.  The only way to be absolutely sure that your valuables are not lost or damaged is to keep them with you.  Even if your baggage is not lost, it could be delayed for as much as a few days.  Do not pack perishables or food items because they may spoil if there is a delay.  It is also suggested that you pack items that you will need during the first 24 hours in a carry-on bag, such as toiletries and a change of underwear.                             Watch your bags and personal belongings at all times.                   Do not accept packages from strangers.                   If you see unattended bags or packages anywhere in the airport terminal or parking area, immediately report them to a security officer or other authority.                   Report any suspicious activities or individuals in the airport or parking lot to airport security.                  Dont joke about having a bomb or firearm.  Dont discuss terrorism, weapons, explosives, threats while going through the security checkpoint.  The mere mention of words such as gun, etc., can compel security personnel to detain and question you.  They are trained to consider comments as real threats.                                Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.

Consider taking public transportation to the airport, if possible.  Parking and curbside access will be controlled and limited.                       Curbside check-in is available only at specific locations.  Contact your airline to see if it is available for your flight.                       Do not leave your car unattended in front of the terminal.  Security measures dictate that unattended cars will be towed.                          Return to        top                                                Checking In                   Checked baggage is subject to weight, size and numerical limits.  On most domestic and international flights, there is a limit of two checked bags per passenger.  You may be subject to extra charges if you bring more, or if you exceed the airlines weight and size restrictions for baggage.    Be sure to clearly label each of your bags with your name, address and phone number.  Without proper labeling, it is difficult to locate lost baggage.  When you check in, also be sure to remove all straps, hooks, and other objects on your luggage that may get caught in the baggage handling machinery.                             Adult passengers must bring a government-issued photo ID.  The FAA requires that air carriers request government-issued identification, such as a drivers license or draft card, if the passenger appears old enough to have an ID.  If a government-issued photo ID is not available, bring two pieces of ID, one of which must be from a governmental authority.                       E-ticket travelers should check with their airline to make sure they have proper documentation.                       Automated kiosks are available for airlines that have appropriate security measures in place.  Travelers interested in this option should check with their airlines.                       Be prepared to answer questions about your bags.  When asked who packed your bags and if you might have left them unattended at anytime, think carefully and answer the questions honestly.  Criminals may use unsuspecting passengers to carry bombs or other dangerous items onto aircraft.                       Be cooperative as screeners ask to hand-search your bags.  Security personnel will search the x-ray scan cannot determine its contents.                                Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.

For fare information, consumers can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or an airline serving their intended destination.  Consumers should also contact each airline to ask about the fares they charge and whether any special promotional fares are being offered.  It is also helpful to pay attention to newspaper, television and radio ads for airline advertisements and discounts.  Consumers with access to the Internet should also visit airline web sites and check for special discount rates.  When purchasing tickets over the Internet, encryption and security precautions should be used.                                                       Tips for Choosing Among Air Fares                   Be flexible with your travel plans in order to get the lowest fare available. Significant savings are sometimes available by flying on certain days, at different times, or even by taking a different flight on the same day.  Consumers should be careful in purchasing discount rated fares because many are non-refundable. If plans change, you may not get your money back.   Make your travel plans as far ahead of schedule as possible.  Many discount rates are limited to a certain number of seats per plane.  Once a ticket is purchased, consumers should call the airline a few times before departure and compare their fare to any other special offers.  New offers are available every day and many airlines, upon inquiry, will refund the difference between a reserved price and a new special offer.    Simply holding a reservation number without a ticket does not guarantee a fare.  While many airlines will not increase the fare after a ticket is issued and paid for, others may reserve the right to collect more money for the same ticket at a later time.  Consumers should inquire about an airlines pricing policy before purchasing a ticket.          Airlines offering interstate and/or foreign flights are required to include a conspicuous written notice, either on the ticket or on another separate written document, that the full text of any contract terms incorporated by reference on the ticket may be inspected at the carriers airport or local ticket office. [1]        These terms may include:                                      Limitations upon carrier liability;                       Claim restrictions, including the applicable periods within which passengers must pursue claims;                       Rights of the carrier to change the terms of the contract, change schedules, and substitute carriers; and                       Rules concerning reservations, check-in times, and refusals to carry.                                An airline must, upon request, provide the full text of its contract to consumers free of charge.  Where an airline is shown to have failed to do so, it may not deny a claim made by a passenger concerning a term purportedly incorporated by reference.  Questions and complaints regarding this rule should be directed to the U.S. Department of Transportation.  See  Appendix .                           Return to        top                                                Reservations and Tickets                   When making a reservation, consumers should be sure the agent records their information accurately.  Review all of the essential information - your name, the flight numbers and travel dates - with the agent before hanging up.  When purchasing tickets more than one week in advance of traveling, you should give the airline your home and work telephone numbers so they can let you know of any changes in the flight schedule.   If you plan to fly during a busy travel period, call for reservations well ahead of time.   Holiday  flights often sell out months before the actual date of travel.  Travelers should avoid using stand-by or open return tickets during these periods as well.  When travel is extremely time sensitive, the larger airlines can provide you with an on-time performance code for flights you are considering.  This enables a traveler to choose among the most punctual flights being offered.   When a reservations agent asks you to buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a deadline that must be adhered to.  If you fail to meet this deadline, the airline is entitled to cancel the reservation without notice.  When purchasing tickets, it is best to do this in person instead of relying upon the mail or picking them up on the day of travel.  By doing so, you will avoid both the possibility of losing tickets in the mail and having to wait in line before boarding.   It is suggested that travelers reconfirm their reservations before they start their trip because flight schedules are subject to change.  For international flights, most airlines require that passengers reconfirm their reservations at least 72 hours in advance.  Failure to do so entitles the airline to cancel the reservation.   Whenever possible, consumers should purchase their airline tickets through the use of a credit card.  Payment by credit card provides certain protections under federal credit laws. [2]   When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application.  If you paid by credit card for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a refund that you are due, report this in writing to your credit card company.  If this is done within 60 days from the time that the credit card company mailed your first monthly statement reflecting the charge in question, the card company should credit your account even if the airline does not.  This option is particularly useful where the airline you purchased a ticket from happens to go out of business before the date of your flight.   Airline tickets are comparable to  negotiable documents , which means that they are quite difficult to replace once lost or stolen.  Every safeguard should be undertaken so that this does not occur.  You should write down the ticket numbers as soon as you receive them, in case they are misplaced or stolen.  This may enable the airline to quickly replace a lost ticket.    If the airline is unable to replace the ticket right away, the passenger will have to purchase a replacement ticket and process a refund application for the lost ticket.  This can take up to six months.                            Return to        top                                                E-Tickets                   Electronic airline tickets, commonly known as E-Tickets, are a relatively new means of purchasing airline tickets.  Many airlines now offer E-Tickets as an alternative to standard paper tickets.  The consumer is given a record locator number and written receipt, and must show his or her credit card and appropriate photo ID at the airport gate.  By reducing ticketing costs, speeding up the accounting and billing process, and reducing the handling costs involved with paper tickets, E-Tickets promise tremendous savings for consumers and the airline industry.   Electronic ticketing is not, however, completely paperless.  Most passengers still want or need a hard copy Passenger Receipt, and most airlines still have a need to issue a paper  Boarding Pass  Also, various government regulations and the Warsaw Convention on liability still require that various paper notices be provided to passengers.   When purchasing an E-Ticket over the telephone, note the name of the ticketing agent, as well as the date and time you purchased the electronic ticket. Then ask the agent to fax or mail you an itinerary indicating that you have purchased an electronic ticket, and a copy of all associated terms and conditions of use.                            Return to        top                                                Delayed and Canceled Flights                   When making travel plans, passengers should always consider the possibility of a flight delay or cancellation.  Making reservations on a second or back-up flight should not be done without first finding out whether you have to pay a cancellation fee or a higher fare for altering your reservations.  If a flight is available on another airline, you can ask the delayed airline to endorse your ticket to the second airline, thereby avoiding a fare increase.  Although there is no rule requiring airlines to do this, they often do so in the interest of good public relations.   If a scheduled flight is canceled, the airline will rebook passengers on the next available flight to the intended destination at no additional charge.  If the rebooking process for another flight involves a significant delay, a passenger may opt to have his or her ticket endorsed and find space on another airline.   Each airline has its own policy on compensating passengers who are stranded as a result of a delayed flight.  If you are delayed, ask the airline staff if they will pay for meals or a phone call.  In situations where the delay is short or where the airline is charging a very low fare for the flight, it is not likely that the airline will offer any help.  Amenities are also likely to be refused where the delay is caused by bad weather or other factors beyond the airlines control.  However, in situations where the airline has caused a significant delay, passengers may often request and have supplied to them a phone call, cab fare, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.  Travelers should keep track of out of pocket expenses and receipts where amenities are denied.  An airlines consumer affairs office may be willing to provide a reimbursement at a later time.   Airlines generally refuse to pay passengers for financial losses resulting from a delayed flight.  If there is significant importance relating to the timeliness of your flight, plan ahead.                            Return to        top                                                Overbooking                        Overbooking is a common practice used by airlines to make up for a certain number of ""no-shows"" on each flight.  When this results in a seating shortage, passengers are sometimes left behind, or bumped.  Airlines must follow federal regulations where this occurs on flights having a capacity of 60 or more passengers. [3]         Passengers may voluntarily be bumped and in cases where an insufficient number of passengers volunteer, involuntary bumping may also be implemented.                           Return to        top                                                Voluntary Bumping                        When a flight is overbooked, the airline is required to seek out passengers who are not in a hurry and are willing to volunteer their seats in return for compensation.  Passengers volunteering to be bumped can keep their original ticket as well.  There are no regulations governing how much a passenger should be compensated for being voluntarily bumped and policies vary among airlines.  Therefore, passengers who volunteer should negotiate with the airline to receive as much compensation as possible.  Before volunteering, you should also ask a few important questions, including:                                  When is the next flight on which the airline can confirm a seat?                       Will the airline provide amenities while waiting for the next flight?                       If a free ticket is offered as compensation, are there restrictions?                                The selection of volunteers is left to the airline and in many cases, they will select those volunteers who are willing to sell back their reservations for the lowest price.                           Return to        top                                                Involuntary Bumping                            Federal regulations require airlines offering flights with a passenger capacity of 60 or more persons to establish boarding priorities for situations where an insufficient number of volunteers offer to take another flight.  In addition, airlines are required to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written statement describing their rights, including the terms, conditions and limitations on compensation.  Included in this statement must be the airlines boarding priority rules and criteria.    With certain exceptions, travelers who are turned away from a flight are entitled to denied boarding compensation, which amounts to being paid for the inconvenience of having to take another flight.  The amount of denied boarding compensation paid to an involuntarily bumped passenger depends on the price paid for their ticket and the length of the delay.  The following rules govern denied boarding compensation:                             If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination within one hour after your original arrival time, there is no entitlement to compensation.                       If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time, the airline must pay you an amount equal to the price of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $200.  On international flights, the delay in arrival time can be between one and four hours.                       If the airline fails to provide substitute transportation or if the substitute transportation provided is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination more than two hours later (four hours later internationally) than your original arrival time, the denied boarding compensation doubles.  Hence, the airline will be compelled to pay you twice the amount of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $400.                           If you have been involuntarily bumped, you can still keep your original ticket and use it on another flight.  If you choose to make your own arrangements, a request can be made for an involuntary refund to recoup the price of the ticket for the flight you were bumped from.  It is important to note that denied boarding compensation should be given in the form of a check to the passenger on the day and place the bumping occurred.  If the alternative transportation provided by the airline departs before this can be done, the payment must be sent to the passenger within 24 hours.   In cases where an airline has to substitute a smaller plane for the originally scheduled plane, the airline is not required to compensate passengers who are bumped as a result.  Denied boarding compensation may also be withheld in certain cases where it is shown that a passenger has not complied with conditions imposed by the airline.  These may include:                             To be eligible for compensation, passengers must have a confirmed reservation.  Where an airline cannot find your reservation, the presence of an OK status on a ticket will suffice, provided however, that the ticket holder has not missed a required reconfirmation deadline.                       All deadlines for purchasing tickets must be met  Most tickets need to be picked up and paid for no later than 30 minutes before a flight departs.  Discount priced tickets must be purchased within a certain number of days after a reservation is made.                       All deadlines set by the airline for checking in must be met.  Most airlines set an amount of time within which passengers must present themselves to the airline before a scheduled departure.  For most domestic flights, passengers are required to check in at least ten minutes before the time of departure.  Do not count on this being the case every time, in that check in deadlines can be up to an hour or longer.  Check-in deadlines for international flights can be as much as three hours before a flights scheduled departure time.  If you miss the ticketing or check-in deadline for your flight, it is possible to lose both your reservation and the right to compensation if the flight is oversold.                           These rules do not apply in the following situations:   Flights on planes with a capacity of 60 or fewer passengers.    Specially chartered flights, international flights inbound to the United States.    Flights between foreign cities.                           These types of flights may have similar rules that can be obtained from the carrier.  The complete rules for the payment of compensation and boarding priorities for each airline are available at all ticket counters and boarding locations.  Also, a notice concerning the overbooking of flights must be clearly posted at each ticket station.

Return to        top                                               Damage and Loss                   Airlines can limit their liability for delay, loss and damage to baggage. [4]   They must conspicuously display a sign stating the extent to which liability is limited.  Typically, airlines limit their liability to $1,250 per passenger on domestic flights and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage on international flights.   If your bag arrives open, unlocked, or visibly damaged, immediately check to see if any of the contents are missing or damaged.  If so, report the damage to the airline right away and insist on filling out a claim form.  If your luggage arrives smashed or torn, the airline will pay for the repairs in most cases.  If the luggage cannot be fixed, the airline will attempt to negotiate a settlement with you.    Airlines often decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or because of inadequate packing precautions.  However, airlines generally do not disclaim liability for fragile merchandise packed in its original factory sealed carton, a cardboard mailing tube, or other container designated for shipping and packed with protective padding material.  If your luggage or an item you are checking is worth more than the monetary cap imposed by the airline, it is suggested that you inquire about purchasing excess valuation insurance from the airline.  This will guarantee replacement if damage does occur.   If your baggage is lost altogether, you will have to fill out another form to secure repayment for your loss.  There are often deadlines associated with filing a lost baggage claim, so it is important to adhere to all of the instructions on the form.  Airlines do not automatically reimburse passengers for the claims they file.  They will use the information you provide to estimate your actual losses, account for depreciation and make an offer of settlement.  Often, an airline will require you to provide receipts for the items you claimed lost.  Generally, it takes between six weeks and three months for an airline to pay a claim for lost luggage.  When they tender a settlement, they may offer either cash or a higher amount in free flight credits.

ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department has also provided information online pertaining to travel scams and card mill scams.  One of the main functions of ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department is the informal mediation of travel-related complaints on behalf of consumers.   Before the Department will become involved in a dispute, it first determines that the complaint meets the following criteria:                             The complaint must be a travel-related dispute against a member of ASTA. You may check a company's membership status in the ASTA Membership Directory found in the ASTAnet directory, or call ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department at 1-703-739-8739.

If your flight has been arranged by a club or other organization for its members it may be what is called an ""affinity"" charter flight. These charters generally do not carry the consumer protection provisions of Public Charters. It is important to be certain of what kind of charter flight you are purchasing.   A Public Charter may include only the flights, or it may be sold as a complete package, including hotels, guided tours, and ground transportation. Either way, your rights are spelled out in a contract you have with the tour operator. The operator or your travel agent should give you a contract to sign at the time you purchase your trip.  This contract should be carefully reviewed before you pay any money.

On some charters, if a substitute can go in your place you only lose a $25 fee.   You can buy trip cancellation insurance. These policies usually provide a refund in case you must cancel due to illness or death in the family. Your travel agent or tour operator can tell you how to buy the insurance and what health conditions it does or doesn't cover.   Cancellation insurance often won't pay you if you must cancel because of a preexisting condition.   The tour operator or airline can cancel a Public Charter for any reason up until 10 days before departure. Your flight might be canceled if it doesn't sell well or for some other reason. This is a risk you take in return for a low fare. (During the last 10 days before departure, a Public Charter can be canceled only if it is physically impossible to operate it.)

Signing a contract does not guarantee that prices won't go up or that itineraries won't change. But, if there is a ""major change"" in your flight or tour, you have the right to cancel and get a penalty-free refund. Major changes include:                                  A change in departure or return city (not including a simple change in the order in which cities are visited).                       A change in departure or return date, unless the date change results from a flight delay. (However, a flight delay of more than 48 hours is a major change.)                       A substitution of a hotel that was not named as an alternate hotel in your contract.

If you choose not to cancel, the operator is not required to make partial refunds. However, if you don't find out about a change until after your trip has begun, you can reject the changed flight or hotel, make and pay for your own alternative plans, and insist on a refund for the changed component when you get home.   No ""open returns"" are allowed on round-trip public charters. Be sure you have a specific return date, city, and flight, in order to avoid being stranded.

The tour operator must have a surety agreement, such as a bond, and must usually have an escrow account at a bank that holds your money until your flight operates. If your money is going into a charter escrow account, the bank will be named in your contract, and the check that is sent to the charter operator should be made payable to that bank. (If you are using a travel agent, it's OK for you to make your check out to that agent; he will make his check payable to the escrow account.) Identify the departure date and destination on the face of the check.

The charter airlines process claims for bags that were lost or damaged while in their possession. If it is not clear where the problem occurred (e.g. between the airport and a hotel), the operator and the airline may both decline liability. To cover yourself, find out if your renter's or homeowner's insurance policy covers losses that happen when you're away from home. You might also ask your travel agent if there's a one-shot baggage insurance policy available to cover baggage problems while you are on your charter trip.

Last-minute schedule changes and departure delays of several hours are not uncommon on charters. A flight can be delayed up to 48 hours before the charter operator must offer you the option to cancel with a full refund.   Charters and scheduled flights operate independently of each other. If there's a delay on the scheduled flight connecting you to the city where your charter departs, causing you to miss your charter, you lose your flight and money. Charter reservations are only good for one flight. If you miss it for any reason, you're probably out of luck. Check with the tour operator to see if he or she has another charter flying to your destination.  If your charter is late returning and causes you to miss a scheduled connecting flight back to your home, you have to pay your own expenses while you wait for the next connection. If you have a discount fare on a scheduled connecting flight you could lose it if the returning charter is delayed. Then you, not the airlines or tour operator, have to pay more for a regular non-discount fare.

You have to claim your baggage and re-check it yourself. When planning a charter, allow plenty of time to check in at the airport from which your charter leaves, or from which you have a connecting flight. On international trips, remember that you may encounter delays in Customs.   You might find seating space for your charter plane to be more crowded than you're used to. The low charter rate depends in part on spreading costs over a large number of people with virtually all of the seats being filled.   If a charter flight hasn't sold out shortly before departure, the operator can sell seats at bargain basement prices to latecomers. Some who have paid the regular price well in advance may object, but should realize that the operator's alternative may be to cancel the flight altogether for economic reasons.

This short work chronicled each of the human space flights conducted by the United States up to that time. At the time of the fortieth anniversary of NASA, born in the aftermath of the Sputnik crisis of 1957-1958, its it fitting to reflect on the record of achievement in human space flight from those first experimental flights of Mercury through the hubris of the Apollo Moon landings to the current flights of the Space Shuttle. Accordingly, as one of its fortieth anniversary projects the NASA History Division sponsored a revision and updating of that earlier chronology.   This is the ninth in a series of special studies prepared by the NASA History Division. The Monographs in Aerospace History series is designed to provide a wide variety of investigations relative to the history of aeronautics and space. These publications are intended to be tightly focused in terms of subject, relatively short in length, and reproduced in an inexpensive format to allow timely and broad dissemination to researchers in aerospace history. Suggestions for additional publications in the Monographs in Aerospace History series are welcome.      ROGER D. LAUNIUS   Chief Historian   National Aeronautics and Space Administration   May 29, 1998     TABLE OF CONTENTS    Introduction   Mercury Missions   Gemini Missions   Apollo Missions   Skylab Missions   Space Shuttle Missions          INTRODUCTION    Almost forty years after the Mercury astronauts made their first brief forays into the new ocean of space, Earth orbit has become a busy arena of human activity. In that time, nearly 300 people have traveled into orbit on U.S. spacecraft. The first astronauts went along, stuffed into capsules barely large enough for their bodies, eating squeeze-tube food and peering out at the Earth through tiny portholes. Their flights lasted only a matter of hours. Today we routinely launch eight people at a time to spend a week living, working and exploring on board the Space Shuttle.   The history of space flight has seen not only an increase in the numbers of people traveling into orbit, but a marked improvements in their vehicles. Each successive spacecraft, from Mercury through Apollo and the Space Shuttle, has been larger, more comfortable, and more capable. Scientists working inside the Shuttle's Spacelab have many of the comforts of a laboratory on Earth, none of which were available when human space flight first began.   Some projects, like Apollo, produced stunning firsts or explored new ""territory."" Others-notably Skylab and the Space Shuttle-advanced our capabilities by extending the range and sophistication of human operations in space. Both kinds of activity are vital to establishing a permanent human presence off the Earth.   Almost forty years after the dawn of the age of space flight, we are learning not just to travel into space, but to live and stay there. That challenge ensures that the decades to come will be just as exciting as the past decades have been.     MERCURY    Project Mercury came into being on October 7, 1958, only a year and three days after the Soviet Union's Sputnik I satellite opened the Space Age. The goal of sending people into orbit and back had been discussed for many years before that, but with the initiation of the Mercury project, theory became engineering reality.   Mercury engineers had to devise a vehicle that would protect a human being from the temperature extremes, vacuum and newly discovered radiation of space. Added to these demands was the need to keep an astronaut cool during the burning, high-speed reentry through the atmosphere. The vehicle that best fit these requirements was a wingless ""capsule"" designed for a ballistic reentry, with an ablative heat shield that burned off as Mercury returned to Earth.   Mercury capsules rode into space on two different kinds of booster. The first suborbital flights were launched on Redstone rockets designed by Wernher von Braun's team in Huntsville, Alabama. For orbital flights, Mercury was placed on top of an Atlas-D, a modified ballistic missile whose steel skin was so thin (to save weight) it would have collapsed like a bag if not pressurized from within.   The first Americans to venture into space were drawn from a group of 110 military pilots chosen for their flight test experience and because they met certain physical requirements. Seven of those 110 became astronauts in April 1959. Six of the seven flew Mercury missions (Deke Slayton was removed from flight status due to a heart condition). Beginning with Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 flight, the astronauts named their own spacecraft, and all added 7 to the name to acknowledge the teamwork of their fellow astronauts.   With only 12.133 cubic meters of volume, the Mercury capsule was barely big enough to include its pilot. Inside were 120 controls, 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. Before Shepard's flight, surrogate ""passengers"" tested the integrity of the spacecraft design: two rhesus monkeys, Ham the chimpanzee, and an electronic ""crewman simulator"" mannequin that could breathe in and out to test the cabin environment. Finally, in May 1961, Shepard became the first American in space. Nine months later, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.   The six Mercury flights (which totaled two days and six hours in space) taught the pioneers of space flight several important lessons. They learned not only that humans could function in space, but that they were critical to a mission's success. Ground engineers learned the difficulty of launch preparations, and found that a worldwide communications network was essential for manned space flight.   By the time of the last Mercury flight in May 1963, the focus of the U.S. space program had already shifted. President John F. Kennedy had announced the goal of reaching the Moon only three weeks after Shepard's relatively simple 15-minute suborbital flight, and by 1963, only 500 of the 2,500 people working at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center were still working on Mercury-the remainder were already busy on Gemini and Apollo.   But Mercury had taken the critical first step, and had given reassuring answers to a number of fundamental questions:       Could humans survive in space?      Could a spacecraft be designed to launch them into orbit?      Could they return safely to Earth?      At the moment John Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule was placed into its orbital trajectory, fulfilling the primary goal of Project Mercury, one member of the launch team on the ground made a notation in his log: ""We are through the gates.""

Shepard, Jr.   Alan Shepard's suborbital flight lasted only 15 minutes, but it proved that an astronaut could survive and work comfortably in space, and demonstrated to the 45 million Americans watching on TV that the United States was now in the space flight business. Freedom 7 was a ballistic ""cannon shot""-Shepard reached no higher than 187.45 kilometers, and traveled only 486.022 kilometers down range from Cape Canaveral. During his short time in space he maneuvered his spacecraft using hand controllers that pitched, yawed and rolled the tiny Mercury capsule with small thrusters. He found the ride smoother than expected and reported no discomfort during five minutes of weightlessness. Although this first Mercury capsule lacked a window, Shepard was able to look down at the Atlantic coastline through a periscope. His view, though, was in black and white-the astronaut had inadvertently left a gray filter in place while waiting on the pad for liftoff.      Mercury Redstone 4 (Liberty Bell 7)   July 24, 1961   Crew Virgil I. ""Gus"" Grissom   Grissom's suborbital mission was essentially a repeat of Shepard's, again using the Redstone launcher instead of the more powerful Atlas. Grissom's Mercury capsule had a few minor improvements, including new, easier-to-use hand controllers, a window, and an explosive side hatch, which the astronauts had requested for easier escape in case of an emergency. Since Shepard's flight had been overly busy, Grissom's duties were deliberately reduced, and he spent more time observing the Earth. The only significant failure came at the end of the 15-minute flight, after Liberty Bell 7 had parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. While Grissom waited inside the floating capsule to be picked up by helicopter rescue teams, the side hatch opened, filling the tiny spacecraft with seawater. Liberty Bell sank, but a wet Grissom was safely recovered, and the Mercury program was able to move on to orbital flights.      Mercury Atlas , 6 (Friendship 7)   February 20, 1962   Crew: John H. Glenn, Jr.   John Glenn's orbital flight-an American first-lasted four hours, 55 minutes, during which he circled the Earth three times, observing everything from a dust storm in Africa to Australian cities from an altitude of 260.71 kilometers. Glenn was the first American to see a sunrise and sunset from space, and was the first photographer in orbit, having taken along a 35­millimeter Minolta purchased from a Cocoa Beach, Florida drugstore. The most nervous moments of the flight came before and during reentry, when a signal received on the ground (erroneously, as it turned out) indicated that the capsule's heat shield had come loose. At one point, Glenn thought his shield was burning up and breaking away. He ran out of fuel trying to stop the capsule's bucking motion as it descended through the atmosphere, but splashed down safely, 64.37 kilometers   short of his target (preflight calculations of the spacecraft's weight had not considered the loss of on­board ""consumables""). Glenn returned to Earth a national hero, having achieved Project Mercury's primary goal.   Mercury Atlas 7 (Aurora 7)   May 24, 1962   Crew: M. Scott Carpenter   The focus of Carpenter's five-hour Aurora 7 mission was on science. The full flight plan included the first study of liquids in weightlessness, Earth photography and an unsuccessful attempt to observe a flare fired from the ground. At dawn of the third and final orbit, Carpenter inadvertently bumped his hand against the inside wall of the cabin and solved a mystery from the previous flight. The resulting bright shower of particles outside the capsule-what Glenn had called ""fireflies""-turned out to be ice particles shaken loose from the capsule's exterior. Like Glenn, Carpenter circled the Earth three times. Partly because he had been distracted watching the fireflies and partly because of his busy schedule, he overshot his planned reentry mark, and splashed down 402.34 kilometers off target.      Mercury Atlas 8 (Sigma 7)   October 3, 1962   Crew: Walter M. Schirra, Jr.   Schirra's was the first of two longer-duration Mercury missions. After Carpenter's flawed reentry, the emphasis returned to engineering rather than science (Schirra even named his spacecraft ""Sigma"" for the engineering symbol meaning ""summation."") The six-orbit mission lasted nine hours and l3 minutes, much of which Schirra spent in what he called ""chimp configuration,"" a free drift that tested the Mercury's autopilot system. Schirra also tried ""steering"" by the stars (he found this difficult), took photographs with a Hasselblad camera, exercised with a bungee­cord device, saw lightning in the atmosphere, broadcast the first live message from an American spacecraft to radio and TV listeners below, and made the first splashdown in the Pacific. This was the highest flight of the Mercury program, with an apogee of 283.24 kilometers, but Schirra later claimed to be unimpressed with space scenery as compared to the view from high-flying aircraft. ""Same old deal, nothing new,"" he told debriefers after the flight.      Mercury Atlas 9 (Faith 7)   May 15-16, 1963   Crew: L. Gordon Cooper, Jr.   If Schirra's mission was an endurance test, the final Mercury flight was a marathon. Cooper circled the Earth 22 1/2 times, and released the first satellite from a spacecraft-a l52.4-millimeter sphere with a beacon for testing the astronaut's ability to track objects visually in space. Although a balloon for measuring atmospheric drag failed to deploy properly, Cooper finally completed another Mercury experiment when he was able to spot a powerful, 44,000-watt xenon lamp shining up from the ground. (He also claimed to be able to see individual houses from orbit, even smoke from chimneys in the Tibetan highlands.) During his 34 hours in space, Cooper slept, spoke a prayer into his tape recorder and took the best photographs of the Mercury program, including pictures of the Earth's limb and infrared weather photographs. His mission was deemed a ""great success-so successful, in fact, that it allowed Mercury officials to cancel a planned seventh flight and move on to the two-man Gemini program.          Gemini    Gemini was not pure pioneering like Mercury, nor did it have the excitement of Apollo. But its success was critical to Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon ""by decade's end.""   The program was announced to the public on January 3, l962, after Apollo already was well underway. Gemini's primary purpose was to demonstrate space rendezvous and docking-techniques that would be used during Apollo, when the lunar lander would separate from the command module in orbit around the Moon, then meet up with it again after the astronauts left the lunar surface. Gemini also sought to extend astronauts' stays in space to two weeks, longer than even the Apollo missions would require.   It was during the Gemini program that space flight became routine. Ten piloted missions left the launch pads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, in less than 20 months, and the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973) outside Houston, Texas, took over the role of Mission Control. Ground operations became smooth and efficient, due in part to fleetingly short launch windows-the Gemini XI ""window"" opened for only 2 seconds-dictated by the need to rendezvous with targets already in orbit. Meanwhile, sixteen new astronauts chalked up experience in space.   The Gemini spacecraft was an improvement on Mercury (it was originally called Mercury Mark II) in both size and capability. Gemini weighed more than 3,628.72 kilograms-twice the weight of Mercury-but ironically seemed more cramped, having only 50 percent more cabin space for twice as many people. Ejection seats replaced Mercury's escape rocket, and more storage space was added for the longer Gemini flights. The long duration missions also required fuel cells instead of batteries for generating electrical power.   Unlike Mercury, which had only been able to change its orientation in space, Gemini needed real maneuvering capability to rendezvous with another spacecraft. Gemini would have to move forward, backward and sideways in its orbital path, even change orbits. The complexity of rendezvous demanded two people on board, and more piloting than had been possible with Mercury. It also required the first onboard computers to calculate complicated rendezvous maneuvers.   Gemini rode into orbit on a Titan 2 launch vehicle. The target for rendezvous operations was an unmanned Agena upper stage, which was launched ahead of the Gemini. After meeting up in orbit, the nose of the Gemini capsule then fit into a docking collar on the Agena.   To avoid long delays between flights, Gemini spacecraft were made more serviceable, with subsystems that could be removed and replaced easily. An adapter module fitted to the rear of the capsule (and jettisoned before reentry) carried on-board oxygen, fuel and other consumable supplies.   Gemini gave U.S. astronauts their first real experience with living and working in space. They had to learn to sleep and keep house on long flights in crowded quarters, both of which were difficult. Gemini astronauts also made the first forays outside their spacecraft, which required a new spacesuit design. Space walks proved more difficult than expected-following Ed White's successful solo on Gemini IV, it wasn't until the final Gemini flight that another extravehicular activity went as smoothly as planned.   By Gemini's end, an important new capability-orbital rendezvous and docking-had become routine, and space doctors had gained confidence that humans could live, work and stay healthy in space for days or even weeks at a time. Gemini also completed a long list of onboard science experiments, including studies of the space environment and Earth photography. Above all, the program added nearly 1,000 hours of valuable space-flight experience in the years between Mercury and Apollo, which by 1966 was nearing flight readiness. Five days before the launch of the last Gemini, Lunar Orbiter 2 had been sent to the Moon, already scouting out Apollo landing sites.      Project Gemini   Dates : 1965­1966   Vehicles : Titan 2 launcher   Gemini spacecraft   Number of People Flown : 20   Highlights : First orbital rendezvous and docking   First U.S. space-walk   Gemini Bibliography   NASA Sources :   Dethloff, Henry C.

Young   In a playful reference to the Broadway hit The Unsinkable Molly Brown, Grissom nicknamed the Gemini 3 spacecraft ""Molly Brown,"" hoping that it would not duplicate his experience with Liberty Bell 7. (It was the last Gemini to be named by an astronaut. All subsequent flights in the program were designated by a Roman numeral.) The mission's primary goal was to test the new, maneuverable Gemini spacecraft. In space, the crew fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit, shift their orbital plane slightly, and drop to a lower altitude. The spacecraft was supposed to have enough lift for a precision landing, but reality did not match wind tunnel predictions: Gemini 3 splashed down some 80.47 kilometers short of its intended target. The capsule was designed to land on its side, suspended at two points from a parachute. But during the descent, when the astronauts threw a switch to shift ""Molly Brown"" to its landing position, they were thrown forward with such force that Grissom's faceplate cracked. Still, the first test of the two­seat spacecraft-and of Gemini ground operations-had been a success.   Gemini IV   June 3­7, 1965   Crew: James A McDivitt and Edward H. White II   The plan for this four-day, 62-orbit mission was for Gemini IV to fly in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan 2 booster in orbit. On this first attempt, however, space flight engineers learned something about the complication of orbital rendezvous. Thrusting toward their target, the astronauts only moved farther away. They finally gave up after using nearly half their fuel. (On later rendezvous missions, a spacecraft chasing another in orbit would first drop to a lower, faster orbit before rising again.) The mission's highlight was White's 22-minute space walk, the first ever for an American. Tied to a tether and using a handheld ""zip gun"" to maneuver himself, White swam through space while McDivitt took photographs. Gemini IV set a record for flight duration, and eased fears about the medical consequences of longer missions. It also was the first use of the new Mission Control Center outside Houston, which because of the long duration, had to conduct the first three-shift operations.      Gemini V   August 21 ­29, 1965   Crew: L. Gordon Cooper. Jr. and Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Jr.   Gemini V doubled the space-flight record to eight days, thanks to new fuel cells that generated enough electricity to power longer missions. Cooper and Conrad were to have made a practice rendezvous with a ""pod"" deployed from the spacecraft, but problems with the electricity supply forced a switch to a simpler ""phantom rendezvous,"" whereby the Gemini maneuvered to a predetermined position in space. Mercury Veteran Gordon Cooper was the first person to travel into space twice. He and Conrad took high-resolution photographs for the Defense Department, but problems with the fuel cells and maneuvering system forced the cancellation of several other experiments. The astronauts found themselves marking time in orbit, and Conrad later lamented that he had not brought along a book. On-board medical tests, however, continued to show the feasibility of longer flights.   Gemini VII   December 4-18, 1965   Crew: Frank Barman and James A. Lovell, Jr.   This 14-day mission required NASA to solve problems of long-duration space flight, not the least of which was stowage (the crew had practiced stuffing waste paper behind their seats before the flight). Timing their workday to match that of ground crews, both men worked and slept at the same time. Gemini VII flew the most experiments-20-of any Gemini mission, including studies of nutrition in space. The astronauts also evaluated a new, lightweight spacesuit, which proved uncomfortable if worn for a long time in Gemini's hot, cramped quarters. The high point of the mission was the rendezvous with Gemini VI. But the three days that followed were something of an endurance test, and both astronauts, heeding Pete Conrad's Gemini V advice, brought books along. Gemini VII was the longest space flight in U.S. history, until the Skylab missions of the 1970s.      Gemini VI   December 15­16, 1965   Crew: Walter M. Schirra, Jr. and Thomas P. Stafford   A rendezvous and docking with an unmanned Agena target was this mission's original objective, but when Mission Control lost contact with the Agena during an October launch attempt, an alternate mission was substituted: a meeting in space of two Gemini spacecraft. Eight days after the launch of Borman and Lovell's Gemini VII, Schirra and Stafford tried to join them, but their Titan 2 launcher shut down on the pad (the cool-headed Schirra did not eject, even though the countdown clock had started ticking-he felt no motion, and trusted his senses). Three days later, Gemini VI made it into orbit. Using guidance from the computer as well as his own piloting, Schirra rendezvoused with the companion spacecraft in orbit on the afternoon of December 15. Once in formation, the two Gemini capsules flew around each other, coming within 0.3048 meters of each other but never touching. The two spacecraft stayed in close proximity for five hours. One of Gemini's primary goals-orbital rendezvous-had been achieved.      Gemini VIII   March 16, 1966   Crew: Neil A. Armstrong and David R. Scott   A second major objective of the Gemini program was completed less than six hours after launch, when Neil Armstrong brought Gemini VIII within 0.9144 meters of the pre­launched Agena target, then slowly docked-the first orbital docking ever. What followed, however, were some of the most hair-raising few minutes in space-program history. The Gemini VIII capsule, still docked to the Agena, began rolling continuously. Never having faced this in simulation, the crew undocked from the Agena, but the problem was a stuck thruster on the spacecraft, which now tumbled even faster, at the dizzying rate of one revolution per second. The only way to stop the motion was to use the capsule's reentry control thrusters, which meant that Armstrong and Scott had to cut short their mission and make an emergency return to Earth 10 hours after launch. They were still nauseated after splashdown, as well as disappointed: Scott had missed out on a planned space-walk.      Gemini IX   June 3­6, 1966   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan   Stafford and Cernan became the first backup crew to fly in space after the first crew of Elliott See and Charles Bassett died in a plane crash four months before the flight. The highlight of the mission was to have been a docking with a shortened Agena called the Augmented Target Docking Adapter. The docking was canceled, though, after Stafford and Cernan rendezvoused with the target to find its protective shroud still attached, which made it look, in Stafford's words, like an ""angry alligator."" Cernan also was to have tested an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) ­ a jet-powered backpack stowed outside in Gemini's adapter module, to which the space­walking astronaut was to have strapped himself. But Cernan's space­walk was troubled from the start. His visor fogged, he sweated and struggled with his tasks, and he had problems moving in microgravity. Everything took longer than expected, and Cernan had to go inside before getting a chance to fly the AMU. The device was not finally tested in space until Skylab, seven years later.      Gemini X   July 18-21, 1966   Crew: John W. Young and Michael Collins   Gemini established that radiation at high attitude was not a problem. After docking with their Agena booster in low orbit, Young and Collins used it to climb another is 482.8032 kilometers to meet with the dead, drifting Agena left over from the aborted Gemini VIII flight-thus executing the program's first double rendezvous. With no electricity on board the second Agena the rendezvous was accomplished with eyes only-no radar. After the rendezvous, Collins space-walked over to the dormant Agena at the end of a 15.24-meter tether, making Collins the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit. He retrieved a cosmic dust­collecting panel from the side of the Agena, but returned no pictures of his close encounter-in the complicated business of keeping his tether clear of the Gemini and Agena, Collins' Hasselblad camera worked itself free and drifted off into orbit.      Gemini XI   September 12-15, 1966   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Jr. and Richard F. Gordon, Jr.   With Apollo looming on the horizon, Gemini project managers wanted to accomplish a rendezvous immediately after reaching orbit, just as it would have to be done around the Moon. Only 85 minutes after launch, Conrad and Gordon matched orbits with their Agena target stage and docked several times. Conrad had originally hoped for a Gemini flight around the Moon, but had to settle for the highest Earth orbit-1367.94 kilometers-ever reached by an American manned spacecraft. Gordon's first space-walk once again proved more difficult than ground simulations, and had to be cut short when he became overtired. A second, two-hour ""stand-up"" space walk went more smoothly: Gordon even fell asleep while floating halfway out the hatch. An experiment to link the Agena and Gemini vehicles with a 15.24 meter tether (which Gordon had attached during his space-walk) and rotate the joined pair was troublesome-Conrad had problems keeping the tether taut-but was able to generate a modicum of ""artificial gravity."" The mission ended with the first totally automatic, computer-controlled reentry, which brought Gemini XI down only 4.506 kilometers from its recovery ship.      Gemini XII   November 11-15, 1966   Crew: James A. Lovell, Jr. and Edwin E. ""Buzz"" Aldrin, Jr.   By the time of the last Gemini flight, the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft. In preparation for Gemini XII, new, improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule, and a new technique-underwater training-was introduced, which would become a staple of all future space-walk simulation. Aldrin's two-hour, 20-minute tethered space-walk, during which he photographed star fields, retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores, at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity. Two more stand-up EVAs also went smoothly, as did the by­now routine rendezvous and docking with an Agena which was done ""manually"" using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed. The climb to a higher orbit, however, was canceled because of a problem with the Agena booster.             Apollo    The Apollo program had been underway since July 1960, when NASA announced a follow-on to Mercury that would fly astronauts around the Moon. But with President John F. Kennedy's speech of May 25, 1961, declaring the goal of landing an astronaut on the surface of the Moon and returning to Earth by decade's end, Apollo shifted its focus. That goal was achieved with five months to spare, when, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquillity.   Apollo was one of the great triumphs of modern technology. Six expeditions landed on the Moon, and one-Apollo 13-was forced to return without landing. Before that, there had been two manned checkouts of Apollo hardware in Earth orbit and two lunar orbit missions.   The Apollo lunar module, or LM, was the first true spacecraft-designed to fly only in a vacuum, with no aerodynamic qualities whatsoever. Launched attached to the Apollo command/service module, it separated in lunar orbit and descended to the Moon with two astronauts inside. At the end of their stay on the surface, the lunar module's ascent stage fired its own rocket to rejoin the command/service module in lunar orbit.   The teardrop-shaped Apollo command module, the living quarters for the three-man crews, had a different shape from the conical-nosed Gemini and Mercury. The attached cylindrical service module contained supplies as well as the Service Propulsion System engine that placed the vehicle in and out of lunar orbit.   Boosting the Apollo vehicles to the Moon was the job of the giant Saturn V-the first launch vehicle large enough that it had to be assembled away from the launch pad and transported there. A fueled Saturn V weighed more than 2.7 million kilograms at liftoff, and stood 110.64 meters high with the Apollo vehicle on top. The vehicle had three stages: the S-lC, SII, and S-IVB, the last of which burned to send Apollo out of Earth orbit and on its way to the Moon.   The Apollo program greatly increased the pace and complexity of ground operations, both before launch and during the missions, when ground controllers had to track two spacecraft at the same time. The lunar missions also required extensive training. Apollo astronauts logged some 84,000 hours-nearly 10 man years-practicing for their flights: everything from simulations of lunar gravity, to geology field trips, to flying the lunar lander training vehicle.   On January 27, 1967, just as the program was nearing readiness for its first manned flight, tragedy struck. A fire inside an Apollo command module took the lives of astronauts Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee, who were training inside it at the time. The fire resulted in delays and modifications to the spacecraft, but by October 1968, Apollo 7 was ready to carry three astronauts into Earth orbit. There, they checked out the command/service module (both had been tested in an unmanned mode during the November 1967 Apollo 4 mission, which was also the first flight of the Saturn V). By December 1968, Apollo 8 was ready to try for lunar orbit (on the Saturn V's third outing), and seven months later Apollo 11 made the first lunar landing.   By the time the Apollo program ended in 1972, astronauts had extended the range and scope of their lunar explorations. The final three missions were far more sophisticated than the first three, in large part because the astronauts carried a lunar rover that allowed them to roam miles from their base. Apollo 11's Armstrong and Aldrin spent only two-and-a-half hours walking on the surface. On Apollo 17 the Moon walks totaled 22 hours, and the astronauts spent three days ""camped out"" in the Moon's Taurus-Littrow valley.   After six lunar landings the Apollo program came to a conclusion (Apollo 18, 19 and 20 missions had been canceled in 1970 because of budget limitations), and with it ended the first wave of human exploration of the Moon.

Eisele, Walter Cunningham   Apollo 7 was a confidence-builder. After the January 1967 Apollo launch pad fire, the Apollo command module had been extensively redesigned. Schirra, the only astronaut to fly Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions, commanded this Earth-orbital shakedown of the command and service modules. With no lunar lander, Apollo 7 could use the Saturn IB booster rather than the giant Saturn V. The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the Service Propulsion System (SPS) ­ the all-important engine that would place Apollo in and out of lunar orbit-made eight nearly perfect firings. Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, eleven days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. The food was bad, and all three developed colds. But their mission proved the spaceworthiness of the basic Apollo vehicle.      Apollo 8   December 21­27, 1968   Crew: Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr., William A. Anders   The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first human beings to venture beyond low Earth orbit and visit another world. What was originally to have been an Earth­orbit checkout of the lunar lander became instead a race with the Soviets to become the first nation to orbit the Moon. The Apollo 8 crew rode inside the command module, with no lunar lander attached. They were the first astronauts to be launched by the Saturn V, which had flown only twice before. The booster worked perfectly, as did the SPS engines that had been checked out on Apollo 7. Apollo 8 entered lunar orbit on the morning of December 24, 1968. For the next 20 hours the astronauts circled the Moon, which appeared out their windows as a gray, battered wasteland. They took photographs, scouted future landing sites, and on Christmas Eve read from the Book of Genesis to TV viewers back on Earth. They also photographed the first Earthrise as seen from the Moon. Apollo 8 proved the ability to navigate to and from the Moon, and gave a tremendous boost to the entire Apollo program.      Apollo 9   March 3-13, 1969   Crew: James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, Russell L. Schweickart   Apollo 9 was the first space test of the third critical piece of Apollo hardware-the lunar module. For ten days, the astronauts put all three Apollo vehicles through their paces in Earth orbit, undocking and then redocking the lunar lander with the command module, just as they would in lunar orbit. For this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft. The gangly lunar module was ""Spider,"" the command module ""Gumdrop."" Schweickart and Scott performed a space walk, and Schweickart checked out the new Apollo spacesuit, the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo machines were up to the task of orbital rendezvous and docking.   Apollo 10   May 18­26, 1969   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, Eugene A. Cernan   This dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought Stafford and Cernan's lunar module-nicknamed ""Snoopy""-to within nine miles of the lunar surface. Except for that final stretch, the mission went exactly as a landing would have gone, both in space and on the ground, where Apollo's extensive tracking and control network was put through a dry run. Shortly after leaving low Earth orbit, the LM and the command/service module separated, then redocked, top to top. Upon reaching lunar orbit, they separated again. While Young orbited the Moon alone in his command module ""Charlie Brown,"" Stafford and Cernan checked out the LM's radar and ascent engine, rode out a momentary gyration in the lunar lander's motion (due to a faulty switch setting), and surveyed the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquillity. This test article of the lunar module was not equipped to land, however. Apollo 10 also added another first-broadcasting live color TV from space.      Apollo 11   July 16-24, 1969   Crew: Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, Edwin E. ""Buzz"" Aldrin, Jr.   Half of Apollo's primary goal-a safe return-was achieved at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 20, when Armstrong piloted the ""Eagle"" to a touchdown on the Moon, with less than 30 seconds' worth of fuel left in the lunar module. Six hours later, Armstrong took his famous ""one giant leap for mankind."" Aldrin joined him, and the two spent two-and-a-half hours drilling core samples, photographing what they saw and collecting rocks. After more than 21 hours on the lunar surface, they returned to Collins on board ""Columbia,"" bringing 20.87 kilograms of lunar samples with them. The two Moon-walkers had left behind scientific instruments, an American flag and other mementos, including a plaque bearing the inscription: ""Here Men From Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon. July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace For All Mankind.""   Apollo 12   November 14-24, 1969,   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad Jr., Richard F. Gordon, Jr., Alan L. Bean   The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting. The descent was automatic, with only a few manual corrections by Conrad. The landing, in the Ocean of Storms, brought the lunar module ""Intrepid"" within walking distance-182.88 meters-of a robot spacecraft that had touched down there two-and-a-half years earlier. Conrad and Bean brought pieces of the Surveyor 3 back to Earth for analysis, and took two Moon­walks lasting just under four hours each. They collected rocks and set up experiments that measured the Moon's seismicity, solar wind flux and magnetic field. Meanwhile Gordon, on board the ""Yankee Clipper"" in lunar orbit, took multispectral photographs of the surface. The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs. When ""Intrepid's"" ascent stage was dropped onto the Moon after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit, the seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.   Apollo 13   April 11-17, 1970   Crew: James A. Lovell, Jr. Fred W. Haise, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr.   The crew's understated radio message to Mission Control was ""Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here."" Within 321,860 kilometers of Earth, an oxygen tank in the service module exploded. The only solution was for the crew to abort their planned landing, swing around the Moon and return on a trajectory back to Earth. Since their command module ""Odyssey"" was almost completely dead, however, the three astronauts had to use the lunar module ""Aquarius"" as a crowded lifeboat for the return home. The four-day return trip was cold, uncomfortable and tense. But Apollo 13 proved the program's ability to weather a major crisis and bring the crew back home safely.      Apollo 14   January 31 ­February 9, 1971   Crew: Alan B. Shepard. Jr., Stuart A. Roosa, Edgar D. Mitchell   After landing in the Fra Mauro region-the original destination for Apollo 13-Shepard and Mitchell took two Moon­walks, adding new seismic studies to the by­now familiar Apollo experiment package, and using a ""lunar rickshaw"" pull­cart to carry their equipment. A planned rock­collecting trip to the 1,000­foot­wide Cone Crater was dropped, however, when the astronauts had trouble finding their way around the lunar surface. Although later estimates showed that they had made it to within 30.48 meters of the crater's rim, the explorers had become disoriented in the alien landscape. Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board command module ""Kitty Hawk"" in lunar orbit. On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon.      Apollo 15   July 26­August 7, /971   Crew: David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, Alfred M. Worden   The first of the longer, expedition-style lunar landing missions was also the first to include the lunar rover, a carlike vehicle that extended the astronauts' range. The lunar module Falcon touched down near the sinuous channel known as Hadley Rille. Scott and Irwin rode more than 27.36 kilometers in their rover, and had a free hand in their geological field studies compared to earlier lunar astronauts. They brought back one of the prize trophies of the Apollo program-a sample of ancient lunar crust nicknamed the ""Genesis Rock."" Apollo 15 also launched a small subsatellite for measuring particles and fields in the lunar vicinity. On the way back to Earth, Worden, who had flown solo on board Endeavor while his crewmates walked on the surface, conducted the first space-walk between Earth and the Moon to retrieve film from the side of the spacecraft.   Apollo 16   April 16-27, 1972   Crew: John W. Young, Thomas K. Mattingly II, Charles M. Duke, Jr.   A malfunction in the main propulsion system of the lunar module ""Orion"" nearly caused their Moon landing to be scrubbed but Young and Duke ultimately spent three days exploring the Descarres highland region, while Mattingly circled overhead in ""Casper."" What was thought to have been a region of volcanism turned out not to be, based on the astronauts' discoveries. Their collection of returned specimens included an 11.34-kilogram chunk that was the largest single rock returned by the Apollo astronauts. The Apollo 16 astronauts also conducted performance tests with the lunar rover, at one time getting up to a top speed of 17.70 kilometers per hour.      Apollo 17   December 7-19, 1972   Crew: Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, Harrison H. ""Jack"" Schmitt   The last man to set foot on the Moon was also the first scientist-astronaut/geologist Harrison Schmitt. While Evans circled in ""America,"" Schmitt and Cernan collected a record 108.86 kilograms of rocks during three Moonwalks. The crew roamed for 33.80 kilometers through the Taurus-Littrow valley in their rover, discovered orange-colored soil, and left behind a plaque attached to their lander Challenger, which read: ""Here Man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind."" The Apollo lunar program had ended.   Apollo 17: Splashdown in the Pacific.     Skylab    NASA had studied concepts for space stations, including an inflatable donut-shaped station, since the earliest days of the space program. But it wasn't until the Saturn rocket came into existence in the mid-1960s that the Skylab program was born. Initially called the Apollo Applications Program, Skylab was designed to use leftover Apollo lunar hardware to achieve extended stays by astronauts in Earth orbit.   At first there were two competing concepts: the so-called ""wet"" workshop, where a Saturn IB would be launched, fueled, and its S IV-B upper stage vented and refurbished in orbit; and the ""dry"" workshop, where the outfitting of an empty S IV-B stage would be done on the ground beforehand and launched on a Saturn V. In July 1969, while the Apollo 11 astronauts were completing their historic lunar landing mission, program managers made their decision: the ""dry"" workshop concept won.   The Skylab space station weighed approximately 100 tons. It was placed into orbit by the Saturn V, the last time that giant launcher was used. Three separate astronaut crews then met up with the orbiting workshop using modified Apollo command and service modules launched by smaller Saturn IB rockets.   Skylab had a habitable volume of just over 283.17 cubic meters. It was divided into two levels separated by a metal floor-actually an open grid into which the astronauts' cleated shoes could be locked. The ""upper"" floor had storage lockers and a large empty volume for conducting experiments, plus two scientific airlocks, one pointing down at the Earth, the other toward the Sun. The lower floor had compartmented ""rooms"" with many of the comforts of home: a dining room table, three bedrooms, a work area, a shower and a bathroom.   The largest piece of scientific equipment, attached to one end of the cylindrical workshop, was the Apollo Telescope Mount, used to study the Sun in different wavelengths with no atmospheric interference. The ATM had its own electricity-generating solar panels.   Skylab also had an airlock module for space-walks (required for repairs, experiment deployments and routine changing of film in the ATM). The Apollo command/service module remained attached to the station's multiple docking adapter while the astronauts were on board.   The space station itself was launched May 14, 1973, on the unmanned Skylab 1 mission. Beginning only 63 seconds after the launch, however, the workshop's combination meteorite shield and sunshade was torn loose by aerodynamic stress, taking one of the two electricity­producing solar arrays with it and preventing the other from deploying properly. The crew was supposed to have launched the next day, but they waited on the ground for 10 days while a fix was worked out (see Skylab 2).   In the course of the next nine months, three different crews lived on board Skylab for one, two, then three months at a time. The station, which orbited at an altitude of 434.52 kilometers, was deactivated between flights. The nine Skylab astronauts chalked up a total of 513 man-days in orbit, during which they conducted thousands of experiments and observations, studying (in decreasing order of the amount of crew time spent): solar astronomy, life sciences, Earth observations, astrophysics, man/systems studies, Comet Kohoutek observations (Skylab 4 only), materials science and student experiments.   Skylab showed the value of having humans working for long periods in orbit on a wide variety of scientific studies, and proved that they could survive the ordeal. More than five years after the last crew left, the empty Skylab station reentered and burned up in the atmosphere on July 11, 1979.      Skylab   Dates : 1973-74   Vehicles : Skylab orbital workshop   Saturn IB launch vehicle (for crews)   Number of People Flown : 9   Highlights : Longest duration space flights in U.S. history   NASA Sources :   Compton, W.

Skylab 2   May 25­June 22, 1973   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad Jr., Paul J. Weitz, Joseph P. Kewin   The first crew to visit the Skylab space station started their mission with home repairs. Skylab's meteorite and sunshield had torn loose during launch, and one of its two remaining solar panels was jammed (see above). Due to concerns that high temperatures inside the workshop- the result of no sunshield-would release toxic materials and ruin on­board film and food, the crew had to work fast. After a failed attempt to deploy the stuck solar panel, they set up a ""parasol"" as a replacement sunshade. The ""fix"" worked, and temperatures inside dropped low enough that the crew could enter. Two weeks later Conrad and Kerwin conducted a space-walk, and after a struggle, were able to free the stuck solar panel and begin electricity flowing to their new ""home."" For nearly a month they made further repairs to the workshop, conducted medical experiments, gathered solar and Earth science data and returned some 29,000 frames of film. The Skylab 2 astronauts spent 28 days in space, which doubled the previous U.S. record.      Skylab 3   July28­September 25, 1973   Crew: Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma, Owen K. Garriott   After an early bout of motion sickness, the three-person Skylab 3 crew settled down to a 59-day stay on board the space station. During the flight, Garriott and Lousma deployed a second sun shield on a space-walk lasting six and a half hours- the first and longest of three Skylab 3 space-walks. During their two months in orbit, the astronauts continued a busy schedule of experiments, including a student experiment to see if spiders could spin webs in weightlessness (they could). They also tested a jet-powered Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) backpack inside the spacious volume of Skylab's forward compartment, which had been carried but never flown on Gemini missions in the 1960s. The AMU proved a capable form of one-man space transportation, and helped engineers design the more sophisticated Manned Maneuvering Unit used on the Space Shuttle in the 1980s.   Skylab 4   November 16, 1973­February 8, 1974   Crew: Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue, Edward G. Gibson   At 84 days, 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 31 seconds, Skylab 4 remains the longest U.S. space flight to date. To help keep the crew in shape, a treadmill was added to the on-board bicycle like ergometer. As a result of the exercise, the Skylab 4 crew was in better physical condition upon their return to Earth than previous Skylab crews, even though an excessive work pace had caused some tension during the flight. Comet Kohoutek was among the special targets observed by the Skylab 4 crew, as were a solar eclipse and solar flares. The astronauts also conducted four space-walks, including one on Christmas Day to view Kohoutek, and set records for time spent on experiments in every discipline from medical investigations to materials science.             Apollo-Soyuz    The final mission of the Apollo era, in July 1975, was the first in which spacecraft from two nations rendezvoused and docked in orbit. The idea for this U.S./Soviet ""handshake in space"" had been initiated three years earlier with an agreement signed by U.S. President Nixon and Soviet President Kosygin.   The American crew for this goodwill flight included Thomas Stafford, a veteran of three flights, Vance Brand, who had never flown in space, and Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, the only one of the original seven astronauts who had never flown (due to a heart condition). The American astronauts traveled into orbit inside a three-man Apollo spacecraft.   Like the Apollo command module, the two­man Soyuz capsule flown by the Soviets had debuted in 1967. On board the Soviet spacecraft were Alexei Leonov, who had made history's first space-walk in 1965, and rookie Valeri Kubasov.   The Apollo-Soyuz mission, aside from its political significance, resulted in a number of technical developments, including a common docking system, which had to be specially designed so that the different spacecraft could connect in orbit. The joint mission also gave both ""sides"" a view of one another's space programs. In preparation for the flight, Soviet cosmonauts and their backups visited and trained at the Johnson Space Center, and the American crew and their backups paid visits to Moscow. Flight controllers from both nations also conducted joint simulations.   Although Apollo-Soyuz was a one-time-only event, it created a sense of goodwill that transcended the simple ""handshake in space"" that was its most visible symbol.   Apollo­Soyuz Test Project   July 15 - 24, 1975   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford, Vince D. Brand, Donald K. ""Deke"" Slayton   The Soyuz 19 and Apollo 18 craft launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other July 15, and docked on July 17. Three hours later, Stafford and Leonov exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. The two spacecraft remained linked for 44 hours, long enough for the three Americans and two Soviets to exchange flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), sign certificates, pay visits to each other's ships, eat together and converse in each other's languages. There were also docking and redocking maneuvers during which the Soyuz reversed roles and became the ""active"" ship. The Soviets remained in space for five days, the Americans for nine, during which the Soviets also conducted experiments in Earth observation.

(MISSING GRAPHICS)          Space Shuttle    Before the Space Shuttle, launching cargo into space was a one-way proposition. Satellites could be sent into orbit, but could not return. The world's first reusable space vehicle changed that, and revolutionized the way people worked in space.   The Space Shuttle was approved as a national program in 1972. Part spacecraft and part aircraft, it required several technological advances, including thousands of insulating tiles able to stand the heat of reentry over the course of many missions, and sophisticated engines that could be used again and again without being thrown away.   The airplane-like orbiter has three of these Space Shuttle Main Engines, which burn liquid hydrogen and oxygen stored in the large External Tank, the single largest structure in the Shuttle ""stack."" Attached to the tank are two Solid Rocket Boosters, which provide most of the vehicle's thrust at liftoff. Two minutes into the flight, the spent solids drop into the ocean to be recovered, while the orbiter's own engines continue burning until approximately eight minutes into the flight.   The Shuttle was developed throughout the 1970s. Enterprise, a test vehicle not suited for space flight, was used for approach and landing tests in 1977 that demonstrated the orbiter's aerodynamic qualities and ability to land (after separating from an airplane). The first spaceworthy Shuttle orbiter, Columbia, made its orbital debut in April 1981.   The first four missions of the new Space Transportation System (STS) were test flights to evaluate the Shuttle's engineering design, thermal characteristics and performance in space. Operational flights began with STS-5 in November 1982, with a four-person crew on board. Over time the crews grew in size: five people flew on STS-7 in 1983, six on STS-9 later that same year. The first seven-person crew flew on STS 41-C in 1984, and in 1985 eight people-a Shuttle record- flew on STS 61-A.   The Space Shuttle changed the sociology of space flight. With such large crews, Shuttle astronauts were divided into two categories: pilots responsible for flying and maintaining the orbiter, and mission specialists responsible for experiments and payloads. A new class of space traveler, payload specialists-who are not even necessarily career astronauts-also was created to tend to specific onboard experiments.   The reusable Shuttles together make up a fleet, with each vehicle continually being processed on the ground in preparation for its next flight. The second orbiter, Challenger, debuted in 1983, followed by Discovery in 1984 and Atlantis in 1985. A fifth orbiter, Endeavour, joined the fleet in 1991, to make its first flight in 1992.   The Space Transportation System introduced several new tools to the business of space flight. The Remote Manipulator System, a 15.24-meter crane built by the Canadian Space Agency and designed to mimic the human arm, is able to move large and heavy payloads in and out of the Shuttle's 18.29-meter-long cargo bay. The Spacelab module, built by the European Space Agency, provides a pressurized and fully equipped laboratory for scientists to conduct experiments ranging in subject matter from astronomy to materials science to biomedical investigations. The Manned Maneuvering Unit backpack allows space-walking astronauts to ""fly"" up to several hundred meters from the orbiter with no connecting tether.   The MMU has figured in several of the Shuttle program's most spectacular accomplishments. On STS 41-C in April 1984, the ailing Solar Max satellite was retrieved, repaired, and reorbited by the astronaut crew, all on the same flight. Later that same year, on STS 51-A, two malfunctioning commercial communications satellites were retrieved in orbit and brought back to Earth in the Shuttle cargo bay. Another malfunctioning satellite was fixed in orbit by the crew of STS 51-I in 1985.   Early in the Shuttle program, communications satellites were common payloads, with as many as three delivered into orbit on the same mission. The January 1986 Challenger accident, which resulted in the loss of the crew and vehicle due to a failed seal in one of the two Solid Rocket Boosters, led to a change in that policy, however. Since returning to flight in September 1988, the Shuttle has carried only those payloads unique to the Shuttle or those that require a human presence. The majority of these have been scientific and defense missions. Among those payloads have been some of the decade's most important space science projects, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Galileo Jupiter spacecraft, and the Gamma Ray Observatory.   In 1995, the Shuttle program added a new capability to its repertoire. In preparation for deployment of the International Space Station, the crew of the Space Shuttle began a series of eight dockings and five crew exchanges with the Russian space station Mir. U.S. astronauts spent time aboard the Mir-sometimes several months at a time-acclimating themselves to living and working in space. They carried out many of the types of activities they would perform on the Space Station and encountered conditions they would possibly encounter.   The Space Shuttle continues today as the nation's most capable form of space transportation. By early 1998, over the course of 89 missions, Shuttle missions had carried 516 people into space, spent a total of 757 days in space, and circled the Earth almost 12,000 times.

In space, Young and Crippen tested the Columbia's onboard systems; fired the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) used for changing orbits and the Reaction Control System (RCS) engines used for attitude control; opened and closed the payload bay doors (the bay was empty for this first flight); and, after 36 orbits, made a smooth touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the landing site for most of the early Shuttle missions.   STS­2   November 12­14, 1981   Columbia   Crew: Engle, Truly   Originally intended to last five days, the Shuttle's second test flight was cut short when problems developed with one of three onboard fuel cells that produce electricity. Engle   and Truly conducted the first tests of the 50-foot Remote Manipulator System arm and operated the Shuttle's first payload: a package of Earth-viewing instruments stored in the cargo bay.   STS-3   March 22-30, 1982   Columbia   Crew: Lousma, Fullerton   The longest of the Shuttle test flights carried space-viewing instruments for the first time. The crew also continued engineering evaluations of Columbia. After rains flooded the dry lakebed at the primary landing site in California, the Columbia made the Shuttle program's only landing to date at White Sands, New Mexico.   STS­4   June 27-July 4, 1982   Columbia   Crew: Mattingly, Hartsfield   The last Shuttle test flight was the first mission to carry payloads for the Department of Defense. It also included the first small ""Getaway Special"" experiments mounted in the cargo bay, and further tested the mechanical and thermal performance of the Columbia, as well as the environment surrounding the spacecraft. Mattingly made the first Shuttle landing on a concrete runway instead of the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base.      STS-5   November 11-16, 1982   Columbia   Crew; Brand, Overmeyer J. Allen, Lenior   The Shuttle's first operational mission also was the first space flight with four people on board. Two commercial communications satellites, SBS-3 and Anik C-3, were launched into orbit from the cargo bay-another first-using the Payload Assist Module (PAM) upper stage designed for the Shuttle. A planned space-walk was canceled when problems developed with the two on-board spacesuits.      STS­6   April 4­9, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Weitz, Bobko, Peterson, Musgrave   Challenger's debut flight included the Shuttle program's first space-walks. Musgrave and Peterson spent more than four hours testing new Shuttle spacesuits and mobility aids, and evaluated their own ability to work outside in the Shuttle's cargo bay. The first of NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellites was launched. The communications satellite initially failed to reach its proper orbit due to an upper stage guidance error, but was eventually maneuvered into the correct position.   STS­7   June 18-24, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, Hauck, Ride, Fabian, Thagard   Except for Crippen, all the members of this crew were from the ""class"" of 1978, the first astronauts chosen for the Shuttle program. STS-7 had a record five people on board, including Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. The crew deployed, rendezvoused with and retrieved the German-built SPAS experiment platform, which took the first full pictures of a Shuttle orbiter in space. The crew also released two communications satellites-Anik C-2 and Palapa B-l- into orbit, and activated a series of materials processing experiments fixed in the Challenger's cargo bay.         STS­8   August 30­September 5, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Truly, Brandenstein, Blaford, D. Gardner, W. Thornton   STS-8 featured the Shuttle program's first night launch and landing. The crew launched India's INSAT 1-B communications satellite, conducted the first tests of Shuttle-to-ground communications with the new Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and exercised the Remote Manipulator ""arm"" with a test article weighing nearly four tons. Thornton, an M.D., conducted biomedical experiments, and Bluford became the first African-American in space.      STS­9   November 28­December 8, 1983   Columbia   Crew: Young, Shaw, Parker, Garriott. PS: Byron Lichtenberg, Ulf Merbold   The first flight of the European-built Spacelab module was a multidisciplinary science mission, with 71 experiments in a wide range of fields: space physics, materials processing, life sciences, Earth and atmospheric studies, astronomy and solar physics. The record six­person crew included the first Shuttle payload specialists: Lichtenberg of MIT, and Merbold, a West German physicist who became the first non-U.S. citizen to fly on an American spacecraft.      41-B   February 3-11, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Brand, Gibson, McCandless, Stewart, McNair   With this flight, the number designations for Shuttle missions changed. The ""4"" indicates the (originally scheduled) year of the launch-1984. The second digit represents the launch site (""1"" for Florida, ""2"" for California), and the ""B"" indicates the second launch of the fiscal year. The highlights of the flight were the first untethered space-walks by McCandless and Stewart, who tested new Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) backpacks that allowed them to travel as far as 97.54 meters from the orbiter. Two satellites deployed from the Shuttle, Westar VI and Palapa B-2, failed to reach their proper orbits when their PAM upper stages did not ignite. Both were later retrieved and brought back to Earth (see STS 51-A). Challenger made the Shuttle's first landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.      41­C   April 6-13, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, Scobee, Hart, van Hoften, Nelson   In the space program's first satellite service call, the crew rendezvoused with and retrieved the Solar Maximum Mission (Solar Max) satellite, which had failed after four years in orbit. With the satellite anchored in Challenger's cargo bay, Nelson and van Hoften replaced a faulty attitude control system and one science instrument, and the repaired satellite was re-released into orbit. The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), a passive satellite for testing the effects of space exposure on different materials, also was deployed on the flight. Originally LDEF was to have remained in orbit for only ten months, but it was not returned to Earth until STS-32 in January 1990.      41­D   August 30-September 5, 1984   Discovery   Crew: Hartsfield, Coats, Mullane, Hawley, Resnik, PS: Charles Walker   The first flight of Discovery was the first Shuttle mission to deploy three communications satellites: Syncom IV-2, SBS-4 and Telstar 3-C. The crew also experimented with a 31.09-meter-high solar cell array, which was unfurled from a stowage container only 177.8 millimeters deep located in the cargo bay. The experiments included testing the structure's stability when the Shuttle's attitude control engines were fired. Walker, a McDonnell Douglas engineer, was the Shuttle's first commercially sponsored payload specialist, on board to tend to the company's Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System for separating materials in microgravity.   41­G   October 5­13, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, McBride, Leestma, Ride, Sullivan. PS: Paul Scully-Power, Marc Garneau   The Shuttle's first seven-member crew included two payload specialists. Scully-Power, a Navy oceanographer, was on board to observe ocean dynamics from orbit. Garneau, the first Canadian in space, operated the multidisciplinary CANEX (Canadian Experiment) package. In Challenger's cargo bay was a suite of instruments dedicated to Earth observation­the primary purpose of this mission. During a three-and-a-half hour space-walk, Sullivan and Leestma also tested connections for an orbital refueling system in the bay. Sullivan was the first American woman to walk in space.      51-A   November 8­16, 1984   Discovery   Crew: Hauck, Walker, J. Allen, A. Fisher, D. Gardner   The STS 51-A crew delivered two satellites-Anik D-2 and Syncom IV-I- into orbit, then brought two others-Palapa B­2 and Westar VI, whose on-board boosters had failed after being deployed on STS 41-B-back to Earth. In separate space-walks using Manned Maneuvering Unit backpacks, Gardner and Allen each docked with an orbiting satellite, stopped its rotation, then assisted as it was stowed in Discovery's cargo bay. Both satellites were then returned for refurbishment on the ground in a dramatic demonstration of the Shuttle's salvage capability.      5l -C   January 24­27, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Mattingly, Shriver, Onizuka, Buchli. PS: Gary Payton   The crew for the Shuttle's first flight dedicated to the Department of Defense included payload specialist Gary Payton of the U.S. Air Force. The cargo, as well as details of the mission, was classified.   51-D   April 12-19, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Bobko, Williams, Hoffman, Griggs, Seddon PS: Charles Walker, Jake Garn   When a booster attached to Syncom IV-3, the second of two communications satellites released into orbit (the other was Anik C- l ), failed to ignite, the crew, with the help of engineers on the ground, attempted a fix. Hoffman and Griggs took an unscheduled space-walk to attach an improvised ""flyswatter"" device to the Remote Manipulator System arm, in the hope that it could trip the satellite booster's sequence start lever. The plan failed, however, and the satellite was eventually ""jump-started"" by STS 51-I astronauts four months later. Utah Senator Jake Garn was the first member of Congress to fly in space.      5I-B   April 29-May 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Overmeyer, F. Gregory, Lind, Thagard, W. Thornton PS: Taylor Wand, Lodewijk van den Berg   The Shuttle's second Spacelab mission included 15 experiments in materials processing, fluid behavior, atmospheric physics, astronomy and life sciences. The crew worked around the clock in shifts, and had trouble with a leaky animal-holding facility making its first test flight. Wang, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, concentrated on studies of fluid behavior in microgravity, while van den Berg of EG&G, Inc. focused on crystal growth experiments. Lind, an astronaut since 1966, made his first space flight.   51-G   June 17­ 24, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Brandenstein, Creighton, Fabian, Nagel. Lucid PS: Patrick Bandry, Sultan Sa/man Abdul Azziz Al Sa'ud   Baudry of France and Al Sa'ud of Saudi Arabia were the international payload specialists for this flight, which successfully launched three communications satellites into orbit: Morelos-1, Arabsat 1-B and Telstar 3-D. SPARTAN-I, a reusable free-flying payload carrier with astronomy instruments on board, also was released, then retrieved, by the Remote Manipulator System arm. The crew conducted materials science and biomedical experiments and participated in a Defense Department tracking experiment in which a laser beam directed from Hawaii was bounced from a reflector on board Discovery back to the ground.   51-F   July 29-August 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Fullerton, Bridges, Musgrave, England, Henize. PS: Loren Acton, John-David Bartoe   The Spacelab 2 mission replaced the Spacelab's enclosed ""long module"" with open pallets containing 13 instruments dedicated to astronomy. Despite problems with an instrument pointing system, the crew was able to collect data on the Sun and other celestial targets. Earlier in the flight, Challenger made the Shuttle program's first ""abort to orbit"" when one of its three main engines shut down during the ascent. Henize and England had waited a long time for a space flight-both had been astronauts during the Apollo era. England had resigned from NASA in 1972, only to rejoin the astronauts corps in 1979.   51-I   August 27-September 3, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Engle, Corey, van Hoften, W. Fisher, Lounge   The Syncom IV-3 satellite (also known as ""Leasat'') stranded in orbit on STS 5I-D was repaired and re-boosted as a result of two space-walks by van Hoften and Fisher that were among the most challenging in the history of the space program. After van Hoften, standing on the end of the Remote Manipulator System arm, grabbed the satellite manually, he and Fisher worked on the satellite in Discovery's cargo bay. The astronauts attached hardware that allowed ground crews to activate Syncom's still-live rocket motor after van Hoften re-released it into orbit with a shove from the cargo bay. Earlier in the flight, the crew had launched three new communications satellites into orbit: ASC-1,   AUSSAT-I and Syncom IV-4 (nearly identical to the one that was rescued).      51-J   October 3­7, 1985   Atlantis   Crew: Bobko, Grabe, Hilmers, Stewart. PS: William Pailes   The first flight of Atlantis was the second Shuttle mission dedicated to the Department of Defense. The payload and on-board activities were classified.   61­A   October 30­November 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Hartsfield, Nagel, Bachli, Bluford, Dunbar. PS: Reinhard Furrer, Wubbo Ockels, Ernst Messerschmid   The Spacelab D-1 mission was the first U.S. manned space flight with a primary payload sponsored by another country-West Germany. On board were 76 experiments, including investigations in fluid physics, materials science, plant physiology and human adaptation to weightlessness. Science experiments were directed from a German Space Operations Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, and two of the payload specialists-Furrer and Messerschmid-were German. With eight people working around the clock in shifts, it was the largest Shuttle crew to date.   61-B   November 26-December 3, 1985   Atlantis   Crew: Shaw, O'Connor, Spring, Cleave, Ross, PS: Charles Walker, Rodolfo Neri Vela   After the crew deployed three communications satellites (SATCOM Ku-2, Morelos 2 and AUSSAT-2) Spring and Ross conducted the first construction experiments in space, assembling and disassembling two tinkertoy-like structures called EASE and ACCESS in the cargo bay of Atlantis. The two space-walking astronauts attached beams, nodes and struts to evaluate different methods of assembling large structures in space. Vela was the first Mexican citizen in orbit, while Walker made his third flight with the commercially sponsored electrophoresis experiment.   61-C   January 12-18, 1986   Columbia   Crew: Gibson, Bolden, Nelson, Hawley, Chang-Diaz. PS: Robert Cenker, Bill Nelson   Rep. Bill Nelson of Florida was the second member of Congress to fly on the Shuttle. The crew deployed an RCA communications satellite and conducted a number of smaller experiments, including several materials science investigations mounted in the cargo bay of the Columbia. An attempt to photograph Comet Halley through an overhead window was unsuccessful, however, due to problems with the instrument's battery.   51­L   January 28, 1986   Challenger   Crew: Scobee, Smith, Onizuka, Resnik, McNair. PS: Gregory Jarvis, Christa McAuliffe   Challenger and all seven members of the crew-including Jarvis, a Hughes employee, and Christa McAuliffe, the designated ""Teacher in Space""-were lost 73 seconds into the flight when the vehicle exploded as the result of a leak in one of two Solid Rocket Boosters. The Shuttle program was delayed for nearly three years while the boosters were redesigned and other safety measures were added. A change in U.S. space policy also resulted from the accident-no longer would the Shuttle carry commercial satellites into orbit.      STS-26   September 29-October 3, 1988   Discovery   Crew: Hauck, Covey, Lounge, Nelson, Hilmers   The first Shuttle mission after the Challenger accident was a conservative, four-day flight that proved the safety of the redesigned Solid Rocket Boosters. On board the Discovery was the first all-veteran astronaut crew since Apollo 11. During launch and reentry, the astronauts wore new partial-pressure flight suits, and in orbit they practiced using a new emergency escape system. The principal payload was a NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite similar to the one lost on STS 51-L, which was released into orbit on the first day.   STS­27   December 2-6, 1988   Atlantis   Crew: Gibson, G. Garner, Mullone, Ross, Shepherd   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­29   March 13­18. 1989   Discovery   Crew: Coats, Blaha, Buchli, Springer, Bagian   Six hours into the mission, the crew released the fourth NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite into orbit. The astronauts conducted experiments in plant growth, crystal growth and the human body's adaptation to weightlessness, and tested a new Shuttle ""fax"" machine. They also took large-format IMAX movie pictures of the Earth, and returned clear photographs of the jettisoned external fuel tank in space.   STS­30   May 4­8, 1989   Atlantis   Crew: Walker, Grabe, Thagard, Cleave, Lee   The Shuttle program's first launch of a planetary spacecraft came on the first day of the mission, when the Magellan Venus Radar Mapper was released from the Atlantis' cargo bay with an Inertial Upper Stage booster attached. The booster fired shortly thereafter to send Magellan to Venus, where it arrived in August 1990 to begin an eight-month mapping mission. Secondary experiments after the deployment included crystal growth studies and a search for thunderstorms in the atmosphere below, called the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment.      STS-28   August 8-13, 1989   Columbia   Crew: Shaw, Richards, Leestma, Adamson, M. Brown   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­34   October 18­23, 1989   Atlantis   Crew: Williams, McCulley, Lucid, E. Baker, Chang-Diaz   The Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft was the Shuttle's second interplanetary cargo. Galileo's mission got underway during Atlantis' fifth orbit around the Earth, when the spacecraft was released from the cargo bay to head toward Venus, the first ""stop"" on its voyage to Jupiter. After releasing Galileo, the crew worked on experiments that included materials science, plant growth and measurements of ozone in the atmosphere.   STS­33   November 22­27. 1989   Discovery   Crew: F. Gregory, Blaha, Musgrave, K. Thornton, Carter   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­32   January 9-20, 1990   Columbia   Crew: Brandenstein, Wetherbee, Dunbar, Low, Ivins   The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), released into orbit on STS 41-C in 1984, was finally retrieved after nearly six years in space. After rendezvousing with the large, cylindrical satellite-one of the most complicated space rendezvous operations ever-the crew photographed the LDEF in orbit, grappled it with the Remote Manipulator System arm, then stowed it in the cargo bay of the Columbia. Scientists who examined the LDEF after landing found evidence of erosion and micrometeorite impacts, as expected. A Syncom satellite also was deployed on the mission. Lasting almost 11 days, STS-32 was the longest Shuttle flight to date.   STS­36   February 28-March 4, 1990   Atlantis   Crew: Creighton, Casper, Hilmers, Mullane, Thuot   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS-31   April 24­29, 1990   Discovery   Crew: Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, Sullivan   The Hubble Space Telescope, the first large optical telescope ever to be placed above the Earth's atmosphere and the first of NASA's ""Great Observatories,"" was released into orbit by the Remote Manipulator System arm on the second day of the flight to begin at least a decade of astronomical observations in space. After the telescope was deployed, the astronauts conducted experiments in crystal growth and monitored the radiation environment on board the orbiter. Because of the need to place the telescope above most of the atmosphere, the Discovery flew the highest Shuttle orbit to date, reaching an altitude of more than 531.08 kilometers.   STS-41   October 6­10, 1990   Discovery   Crew: Richards, Cabana, Mellnick, Shepherd, Akers   Deployment of the European Space Agency's Ulysses spacecraft to explore the polar regions of the Sun was the highlight of this four-day mission. On the first day of the flight, the crew sprung Ulysses from Discovery's cargo bay, and on-board rockets fired to send the spacecraft toward a gravity assist at Jupiter. After the deploy, the astronauts conducted a number of secondary experiments, including taking measurements of atmospheric ozone, studying the effects of atomic oxygen on spacecraft materials and evaluating a new ""hands-off"" voice command system in the Shuttle crew cabin.   STS­38   November 15­20, 1990   Atlantis   Crew: Corey, Culbertson, Springer, Meade, Gemar   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­35   December 2­10, 1990   Columbia   Crew: Brand, Gardner, Hoffman, Lounge, Parker. PS: Ronald Parise, Samuel Durrance   STS-35 was the first Spacelab mission since the Challenger accident, and the first Shuttle flight dedicated to a single discipline: astrophysics. Discovery carried a group of astronomical telescopes called ASTRO-1 in its cargo bay, as well as four Ph.D.'s in astronomy: Hoffman, Parker, Durrance of Johns Hopkins University, and Parise of the Computer Science Corporation. Despite several hardware malfunctions, the crew was able to make observations of a wide variety of astronomical targets, from comets to quasars, with particular attention to x-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths.   STS-37   April 5-11, 1991   Atlantis   Crew: Nagel. Cameron. Apt, Godwin, Ross   The Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), was released by Atlantis Remote Manipulator System arm on the third day of the flight, after Ross and Apt made an unscheduled space-walk to repair an antenna on the spacecraft. The second of NASA's ""Great Observatories"" designed for a long-term program of astronomical observations from Earth orbit, the GRO was the heaviest science satellite ever launched from the Shuttle. Later in the mission, Ross and Apt returned to the cargo bay to rest rail-mounted mechanical pushcarts planned for use on Space Station Freedom. The two space-walks were the first in more than five years.      STS­39   April 28 - May 6, 1991   Discovery   Crew: Coats, Hammond, Bluford, Harbaugh, Hieb, McMonagle, Veach   The first unclassified defense-related mission of the Shuttle program included experiments sponsored by the Air Force and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) organization. The studies included extensive infrared, ultraviolet, visible and x-ray observations of the space environment and the Shuttle itself. On-board instruments also returned high-quality images of the Earth's aurora. In an experiment related to ballistic­missile defense, Discovery released a SPAS instrument platform equipped with infrared sensors to fly in formation and observe rocket thruster plumes as the Shuttle performed a complicated series of maneuvers.      STS­40   June 5-14, 1991   Columbia   Crew: O'Connor. Gutierrez. Bagian.   Jernigan. Seldon PS: F. Drew Gaffney, Millie Hughes-Fulford   The Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1) mission was the first dedicated entirely to understanding the physiological effects of space flight. An extensive series of biomedical experiments were conducted on crew members during the nine-day mission, and the results were compared with baseline data collected on the ground before and after the flight. Along with the human subjects, rodents and jellyfish also were on board to test their adaptation to microgravity.   STS-43   August 2-11, 1991   Atlantis   Crew: Blaha, Baker, Adamson, Low, Lucid   This mission marked the first scheduled landing at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility since January 1986. The Tracking/Data Relay Satellite-5 was the mission's primary payload. The satellite became the fourth member of the orbiting TDRS cluster, which now consisted of two operating satellites plus two spares in the space network.

STS-49   May 7-16, 1992   Endeavour   Crew: Brandenstein, Chilton, Melnick, Akers, Hieb, Thornton, Thuot   STS-49 was marked by a number of ""firsts."" Four space walks, the most ever on a single mission, highlighted the first voyage of the orbiter Endeavour. Two of these were the longest in U.S. space flight history to date, lasting eight hours and 29 minutes and seven hours and 45 minutes. The flight also featured the longest space walk to date by a female astronaut and was the first space flight where three crew members worked outside the spacecraft at the same time. It also was the first time that astronauts attached a live rocket motor to an orbiting satellite. The crew also successfully captured and redeployed the Intelsat-VI satellite, which had been stranded in an unusable orbit since its launch in March 1990.

STS-46   July 31-August 8, 1992   Atlantis   Crew: Shriver, Allen, Hoffman, Chang-Diaz, Ivins, Nicollier, PS: Franco Malerba   The primary mission objective was deployment of the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) and operation of the NASA-Italian Tethered Satellite System (TSS). After a delay and a shorter-than-planned thruster firing, the satellite was successfully boosted to operational orbit. During TSS deployment, the satellite at the end of the tether reached a distance of only 256 meters rather than its planned 20 kilometers because of a jammed tether line. The satellite it carried was restowed for return to Earth.   STS-47   September 12-20, 1992   Endeavour   Crew: Gibson, Brown, Lee, Davis, Apt, Jemison, PS: Mamoru Mohri   Spacelab-J, the first Japanese Spacelab, debuted on this flight. Jointly sponsored by NASA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, the mission included 24 materials science and 19 life sciences experiments. Test subjects included members of the crew, Japanese koi fish, cultured animal and plant cells, chicken embryos, fruit flies, fungi and plant seeds, and frogs and frog eggs. The crew also included the first African-American woman to fly in space, Mae Jemison the first married couple (Mark Lee and Jan Davis), and the first Japanese person to fly on the Shuttle, Mamoru Mohri.   STS-52   October 22-November 1, 1992   Columbia   Crew: Wetherbee, Baker, Veach, Jernigan, Shepherd, PS: Steven MacLean   The mission deployed the Laser Geodynamic Satellite II (LAGEOS), a joint effort of NASA and the Italian Space Agency, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload-1 (USMP-1). LAGEOS was boosted into orbit by the Italian Research Interim Stage (IRIS), its first use. Studies focused on the influence of gravity on basic fluid and solidification processes.   STS-53   December 2-9, 1992   Discovery   Crew: Walker, Cabana, Bluford, Voss, Clifford   This was the last Shuttle flight for the Department of Defense. The Discovery deployed a classified payload, after which flight activities became unclassified. Ten secondary payloads were contained in or attached to Get Away Special hardware in the cargo bay or located on the middeck.   STS-54   January 13-19, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Casper, McMonagle, Runco, Harbaugh, Helms   The fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-6), part of NASA's orbiting communications system, was deployed on this mission. On the fifth day of the flight, mission specialists Runco and Harbaugh spent almost five hours walking in the open payload bay, performing a series of extravehicular activity (EVA) tasks designed to increase NASA's knowledge of working in space. The astronauts tested their abilities to move freely in the cargo bay, climb into foot restraints without using their hands, and simulated carrying large objects in a microgravity environment. A Hitchhiker experiment collected data on stars and galactic gases.   STS-56   April 8-17, 1993   Discovery   Crew: Cameron, Oswald, Cockrell, Foale, Ochoa   The primary payload was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-2 (ATLAS-2), which collected data on the relationship between the sun's energy output and the Earth's middle atmosphere and their affect on the ozone layer. ATLAS-2 was one element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program. The crew also used the remote manipulator arm to deploy the SPARTAN-201, a free-flying science instrument platform that studied velocity and acceleration of solar wind and observed the sun's corona. Using the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment II (SAREX II), the crew also contacted schools around the world and briefly contacted the Russian Mir space station, the first contact between the Shuttle and Mir using amateur radio equipment.   STS-55   April 26-May 6, 1993   Columbia   Crew: Nagel, Henricks, Ross, Precourt, Harris, PS: Ulrich Walter, Hans W. Schlegel   This mission marked the second German Spacelab mission, designated D2. Around-the-clock crews conducted some 88 experiments, covering materials and life sciences, technology applications, Earth observations, astronomy, and atmospheric physics.   STS-57   June 21-July 1, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Grabe, Duffy, Low, Sherlock, Voss, Wisoff   STS-57 marked the first flight of the commercially developed SPACEHAB, a laboratory designed to more than double pressurized workspace for crew-tended experiments. Altogether, 22 experiments were flown, covering materials and life sciences, and a wastewater recycling experiment for the future Space Station. A five-hour, 50-minute space walk succeeded in retrieving and stowing the 4,275-kilogram EURECA science satellite inside the Endeavour's payload bay. The satellite had been deployed on the STS-46 mission in 1992. Two crew members also carried out maneuvers using the robot arm. During the mission, the crew also spoke with President Clinton.   STS-51   September 12-22, 1993   Discovery   Crew: Culbertson Readdy, Newman, Bursch, Walz   The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) was deployed on this mission. The attached Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) booster was used for the first time to propel the communications technology spacecraft to geosynchronous transfer orbit. The second primary payload, the OERFEUS-SPAS, first in a series of ASTRO-SPAS astronomical missions, was also deployed. The joint German-U.S. astrophysics payload was controlled from the SPAS Payload Operations Control Center at Kennedy Space Center, the first time a Shuttle payload was managed from Florida. Two crew members also performed a space walk that lasted seven hours, five minutes, and 28 seconds. It was the last in a series of generic space walks begun earlier in the year.   STS-58   October 18-November 1, 1993   Columbia   Crew: Blaha, Searfoss, Seddon, McArthur, Wolf, Lucid, PS: Martin Fettman   STS-58 was the second dedicated Spacelab Life Sciences mission. Fourteen experiments were conducted in regulatory physiology, cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neuroscience. Eight of the experiments centered on the crew, six on 48 rodents carried on board. With the completion of her fourth space flight, Shannon Lucid accumulated the most flight time for a female astronaut on the Shuttle, 838 hours.   STS-61   December 2-13, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Covey, Bowersox, Musgrave, Hoffman, Thornton, Akers, Nicollier   This Shuttle flight was one of the most challenging and complex missions every attempted. During a record five back-to-back space walks totaling 35 hours and 28 minutes, two teams of astronauts completed the first servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope. On the first space walk, which lasted seven hours and 54 minutes, the two-person team replaced two Rate Sensing Units, two Electronic Control Units, and eight electrical fuse plugs. On the second space walk, which lasted six hours and 35 minutes, two astronauts installed new solar arrays. On the third space walk, the Wide Field/Planetary Camera was replaced in about 40 minutes rather than in the four hours that had been anticipated. This team also installed two new magnetometers at the top of the telescope. On the fourth space walk, crew members removed and replaced the High-Speed Photometer with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement unit. During this six-hour, 50-minute EVA, astronaut Akers set a new U.S. space-walking record of 29 hours, 14 minutes. The final space walk replaced the Solar Array Drive Electronics unit and installed the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph Redundancy kit and also two protective covers over the original magnetometers.   STS-60   February 3-11, 1994   Discovery   Crew: Bolden, Reightler, Chang-Diaz, Davis, Sega, Krikalev   This first Shuttle flight of 1994 marked the first flight of a Russian cosmonaut on the U.S. Space Shuttle­part of an international agreement on human space flight. The mission also was the second flight of the SPACEHAB pressurized module and marked the 100th Get Away Special payload to fly in space. Also on this mission, the Discovery carried the Wake Shield Facility to generate new semiconductor films for advanced electronics.   STS-62   March 4-18, 1994   Columbia   Crew: Casper, Allen, Gemar, Ivins, Thuot   The primary payloads were the U.S. Microgravity Payload-2 (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 (OAST-2). USMP-2 included five experiments investigating materials processing and crystal growth in microgravity. OAST-2's six experiments focused on space technology and space flight. Both payloads were located in the payload bay, activated by crew members, and operated by teams on the ground.   STS-59   April 9-20, 1994   Endeavour   Crew: Gutierrez, Chilton, Godwin, Apt, Clifford, Jones   The Space Radar Laboratory-1 was the primary payload. It gathered data on the Earth and the effect of humans on its carbon, water, and energy cycles. It was located in the payload bay, activated by crew members, and operated by teams on the ground. The German Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency provided one instrument, the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR). This instrument imaged more than 400 sites and covered approximately 38.5 million miles of the Earth, equivalent to 20 percent of the planet.   STS-65   Columbia   July 8-23, 1994   Crew: Cabana, Halsell, Hieb, Thomas, Walz, Chiao, PS: Chiaki Naito-Mukai   STS-65 was the Columbia's last mission before its scheduled modification and refurbishment. This flight saw the first Japanese woman fly in space-payload specialist Chiaki Naito-Mukai. She also set the record for the longest flight to date by a female astronaut. The International Microgravity Laboratory-2 flew for the second time, carrying more than twice the number of experiments and facilities as on its first mission. Crew members split into two teams to perform around-the-clock research on the behavior of materials and life in near weightlessness. More than 80 experiments, representing more than 200 scientists from six space agencies, were located in the Spacelab module in the payload bay. This flight also marked the first time that liftoff and reentry were captured on videotape from the crew cabin. This flight was the longest Shuttle flight to date, lasting 14 days and 18 hours.   STS-64   September 9-20, 1994   Discovery   Crew: Richards, Hammond, Helms, Meade, Lee, Linenger   STS-64 marked the first flight of the Lidar In-Space Technology Experiment (LITE), which was used to perform atmospheric research. It also included the first untethered U.S. extravehicular activity (EVA) in 10 years. LITE involved the first use of lasers for environmental research. During the mission, the crew also released and retrieved the SPARTAN-201 using the remote manipulator system arm.   STS-68   September 30-October 11, 1994   Endeavour   Crew: Baker, Wilcutt, Jones, Bursch, Wisoff, Smith   This mission marked the second 1994 flight of the Space Radar Laboratory, part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. Flying the SRL in different seasons allowed investigators to compare observations between the two flights. The mission also tested the ability of SRL-2 imaging radar to distinguish between changes caused by human-induced phenomena such as oil spills and naturally occurring events. Five Get Away Specials were among the other cargo bay payloads. These included two by the U.S. Postal Service that held 500,000 commemorative stamps honoring the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11. STS-68 set another duration record, lasting more than 16-1/2 days.   STS-66   November 3-14, 1994   Atlantis   Crew: McMonagle, Brown, Ochoa, Tanner, Parazynski, Clervoy   STS-66 advanced data collection about the sun's energy output, chemical makeup of the Earth's middle atmosphere, and how these factors affect global ozone levels with the third flight of its Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ASTRO-3). The other primary payloads were CRISTA-SPAS, which continued the joint NASA-German Space Agency series of scientific missions, and the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet spectrometer. CRISTA-SPAS was released and retrieved using the remote manipulator system arm.   STS-63   February 3-11, 1995   Discovery   Crew: Wetherbee, Collins, Harris, Foale, Voss, Titov   This mission had special importance as a precursor and dress rehearsal for the series of missions that would rendezvous and dock with the Russian space station Mir. The orbiter Discovery approached within 12.2 meters of the Mir, then backed off to about 121.9 meters and performed a flyaround. The six-person crew included the second Russian cosmonaut to fly on the Space Shuttle. The mission also deployed the SPARTAN-204, a free-flying spacecraft that made astronomical observations in the far ultraviolet spectrum. The mission also included the third operation of the commercially developed SPACEHAB module, with its array of technological, biological, and other scientific experiments. Two crew members performed a space walk to test spacesuit modifications and demonstrate large-object handling techniques.   STS-67   March 2-18, 1995   Endeavour   Crew: Oswald, Gregory, Grunsfeld, Lawrence, Jernigan, PS: Ronald Parise, Samuel Durrance   The second Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ASTRO-2) flew on this mission. Its objectives were to obtain scientific data on astronomical objects in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Its three telescopes made observations in complementary regions of the spectrum and gathered data that would add to scientists' understanding of the universe's history and the origins of stars. STS-67 set a new mission duration record of 16.6 days.   STS-71   June 27-July 7, 1995   Atlantis   Crew: Gibson, Precourt, Baker, Harbaugh, Dunbar   This flight marked the 100th U.S. human space flight and was the first of a series of flights that docked with the Russian space station Mir. On STS-71, the Atlantis and Mir remained docked for five days. The seven-person Shuttle crew included two Russian cosmonauts who remained on the Mir after the Atlantis returned to Earth. Two other cosmonauts and the U.S. astronaut Thagard, who had flown to Mir aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in March 1995, returned to Earth in the Atlantis. The mission demonstrated the successful operation of the Russian-designed docking system, which was based on the concepts used in the Apollo-Soyuz test program flown in 1975.   STS-70   July 13-22, 1995   Discovery   Crew: Henricks, Kregel, Currie, Thomas, Weber   The deployment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-7) marked the completion of NASA's TDRS system that provided communication, tracking, telemetry, data acquisition, and command services to the Shuttle and other low orbital spacecraft missions. STS-70 also marked the first flight of the new Block I Space Shuttle main engine. The engine featured improvements that increased the stability and safety of the main engines.   STS-69   September 7-18, 1995   Endeavour   Crew: Walker, Cockrell, Voss, Newman, Gernhardt   STS-69 deployed the Wake Shield Facility, which, flying separately from the Shuttle, produced an ""ultra vacuum"" in its wake and allowed experimentation in the production of advanced, thin film semiconductor materials. The SPARTAN spacecraft also was deployed and retrieved. The space walk on this mission was the 30th Shuttle extravehicular activity.   STS-73   October 20-November 5, 1995   Columbia   Crew: Bowersox, Rominger, Thornton, Coleman, Lopez-Alegria, PS: Fred Leslie, Albert Sacco   The second United States Microgravity Laboratory was the primary payload on STS-73. Some of the experiments on USML-2 resulted from the outcome of investigations on the first USML mission that flew aboard the Columbia on STS-50.   STS-74   November 12-20, 1995   Atlantis   Crew: Cameron, Halsell, Hadfield, Ross, McArthur   STS-74 was the second in a series of Mir linkups. The mission marked the first time that astronauts from the European Space Agency, Canada, Russia, and the United States were in space on the same complex at one time.   STS-72   January 11-20, 1996   Endeavour   Crew: Duffy, Jett, Chiao, Barry, Scott, Wakata   The crew of STS-72 captured and returned to Earth a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft, the Space Flyer Unit, which had been launched by Japan in March 1995. The mission also deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer spacecraft, the seventh in a series of missions aboard reusable free-flying SPARTAN carriers. The flight also included two space walks by three astronauts to test hardware and tools that will be used in the assembly of the Space Station.   STS-75   February 22-March 9, 1996   Columbia   Crew: Allen, Horowitz, Hoffman, Cheli, Nicollier, Chang-Diaz, PS: Umberto Guidoni   This mission was the 50th Shuttle flight since NASA's return to flight following the Challenger accident and the 75th Shuttle flight. Its mission was a reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS). The tether broke three days into the mission.      STS-76   March 22-31, 1996   Atlantis   Crew: Chilton, Searfoss, Godwin, Sega, Clifford, Lucid   This mission featured the third docking between the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the Russian Space Station Mir. It included a space walk, logistics operations, and scientific research. More than 862 kilograms of equipment were transferred from the Atlantis to the Mir, including a gyrodyne, transformer, batteries, food, water, film, and clothing. Astronaut Shannon Lucid, the second U.S. astronaut and the first U.S. woman, began what would turn out to be a marathon stay on the Mir.   STS-77   May 19-29, 1996   Endeavour   Crew: Casper, Brown, Bursch, Runco, Garneau, Thomas   During this flight, the six-person Endeavour crew performed microgravity research aboard the commercially owned and operated SPACEHAB module. The crew also deployed and retrieved the Sparton-207/IAE (Inflatable Antenna Experiment) satellite. A suite of four technology experiments called the Technology Experiments for Advancing Mission in Space (TEAMS) also flew in the Shuttle's payload bay.   STS-78   June 20-July 7, 1996   Columbia   Crew: Henricks, Kregel, Helms, Linnehan, Brady, PS: J. Favier, R. Thirsk   The Life and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission, building on previous Shuttle Spacelab flights dedicated to life sciences and microgravity investigations, studied the effects of long-duration space flight on human physiology and conducted the type of experiments that would fly on the Space Station. The length of this flight surpassed the longest Shuttle flight to date, lasting almost 17 days.   STS-79   September 16-26, 1996   Atlantis   Crew: Readdy, Wilcutt, Akers, Apt, Walz, Blaha, Lucid   On this mission, astronaut Shannon Lucid set the world's women's and U.S. record for length of time in space: 188 days and five hours. The mission was the fourth Shuttle docking with the Mir space station. Astronaut Lucid returned to Earth on the Atlantis and astronaut Blaha replaced her on the Mir.   STS-80   November 19-December 7, 1996   Crew: Cockrell, Rominger, Jernigan, Jones, Musgrave   STS-80 marked the third flight of the Wake Shield Facility that flew on STS-60 and STS-69 and the third flight of the German-built ORFEUS-SPAS II. Both the Wake Shield Facility and the ORFEUS-SPAS were deployed and retrieved during the mission, making it the first time that two satellites were flying freely at the same time. The record for the longest Shuttle flight was broken again, with this flight lasting slightly more than 17-1/2 days.   STS-81   January 12-22, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Baker, Jett, Wisoff, Grunsfeld, Ivins, Linenger, Blaha   This mission was the fifth of nine planned missions to Mir and the second involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut Linenger replaced astronaut Blaha aboard the Mir after spending 128 days in space. The Atlantis carried the SPACEHAB double module, which provided additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments.   STS-82   February 11-21, 1997   Discovery   Crew: Bowersox, Horowitz, Tanner, Hawley, Harbaugh, Lee, Smith   STS-82 was the second in a series of planned servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The orbiter's robot arm captured the HST so it could be serviced. In five space walks, the crew replaced the Goddard High Resolution Spectrometer and the Faint Object Spectrograph with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. Crew members also replaced other hardware with upgrades and spares. HST received a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor and a refurbished spare Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) to replace one of four RWAs. A Solid State Recorder replaced one reel-to-reel tape recorder. The crew members also replaced the HST's insulation, which had deteriorated due to rapid heating and cooling as the telescope moved into and out of sunlight and also due to constant exposure to the molecular oxygen encountered in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.   STS-83   April 4-8, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Halsell, Still, Voss, Gernhardt, Thomas, PS: Roger Crouch, Greg Linteris   This mission lasted only four days and returned to Earth 12 days early due to a problem with one of the fuel cells that provided electricity and water to the orbiter. The Microgravity Science Laboratory-1 was rescheduled for a later mission.      STS-84   May 15-24, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Precourt, Collins, Clervoy, Noriega, Lu, Kondakova, Foale, Linenger   This was the sixth docking with the Mir space station and the third involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut Foale replaced astronaut Linenger, who had been in space for 132 days. The mission resupplied materials for experiments to be performed aboard the Mir and also returned experiment samples and data to Earth.   STS-94   July 1-17, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Halsell, Still, Voss, Gernhardt, Thomas, Crouch, Linteris   The reflight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1), which had flown on STS-83, took place on this mission. (STS-83 was cut short due to fuel cell problems.) The mission involved the same vehicle, crew, and experiment activities as planned on the earlier mission. MSL-1 focused on the phenomena associated with the routine influence of gravity, including the behavior of materials and liquids in a microgravity environment. The laboratory was a collection of 19 microgravity experiments housed inside a European Spacelab Long Module.      STS-85   August 7-19, 1997   Discovery   Crew: Brown, Rominger, Davis, Curbeam, Robinson, PS: Bjarni Tryggvason   The primary payload for STS-85 was the second flight of the CRISTA-SPAS-2. It was the fourth in a series of cooperative ventures between the German Space Agency and NASA. CRISTA-SPAS-2 was deployed and retrieved using the Discovery's robot arm. Two other instruments on board also studied the Earth's atmosphere: the Middle Atmosphere High Resolution Spectrograph Instrument (MAHRSI) measured hydroxyl and nitric oxide, while the Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM) carried state-of-the-art optical surfaces to study the impact of the atomic oxygen and the space environment on materials and services. The Technology Applications and Science (TAS-1), the Manipulator Flight Demonstration, supplied by Japan, and the international Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker were other mission payloads.   September 25-October 6, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Wetherbee, Bloomfield, Parazynski, Titov, Chretien, Lawrence, Wolf, Foale   This was the seventh docking between the Atlantis and the Russian Mir space station and the fourth exchange of U.S. astronauts. The mission included a flyaround of the Mir to determine the location of the puncture on the hull of the Spektr module. The Mir crew pumped air into the Spektr module, and the Shuttle crew observed that the leak seemed to be located at the base of damaged solar panel. U.S. astronaut Foale returned aboard the Atlantis after a stay of 134 days on the Mir. His was the second longest single space flight in U.S. space flight history behind Shannon Lucid's 188-day flight in 1996. The Atlantis also carried the SPACEHAB double module to support the transfer of logistics and supplies for the Mir and the return of experiment hardware and specimens to Earth.      STS-87   November 19-December 5, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Kregel, Lindsey, Chawla, Scott, Doi, PS: Leonid Kadenyuk   Experiments that studied how the weightless environment of space affected various physical processes and two space walks highlighted STS-87. During this mission, payload specialist Kadenyuk became the first Ukranian to fly aboard the Space Shuttle. The mission was marked by an unexpected event when the attitude control system aboard the free-flying SPARTAN solar research satellite malfunctioned, causing the satellite to rotate outside the Shuttle. Crew members successfully recaptured the satellite and lowered it onto its berth in the payload bay. The capture took place during a space walk that lasted seven hours and 43 minutes. A second space walk that lasted seven hours and 33 minutes tested a crane that will be used in constructing the Space Station and a free-flying camera that will be able to monitor conditions outside the Space Station without requiring space walks.      STS-89   January 22-31, 1998   Endeavour   Crew: Wilcutt, Edwards, Reilly, Anderson, Dunbar, Sharipov, Thomas, Wolf   STS-89 featured the eighth Mir-Shuttle linkup and the fifth crew exchange. Astronaut Wolf, who had been on the Mir since September 1997, was replaced by astronaut Thomas.         Monographs in Aerospace History      Launius, Roger D., and Gillette, Aaron K. Compilers.

Feb                28, 2002                 Cold forecast delays shuttle                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- NASA postponed shuttle Columbia's launch by a day rather                than contend with cold weather this morning. The agency will try                again at 6:22 a.m. Friday. The weather then is forecast to be 49                degrees at launch time, with an 80 percent chance of acceptable                weather.                                 Temperatures were expected to approach the lower limit for liftoff                today at Kennedy Space Center, so shuttle managers announced the                delay after the six-man, one-woman crew went to sleep Wednesday                afternoon. The astronauts will spend today training for their mission                to the Hubble Space Telescope.                                 Freezing temperatures were implicated in the shuttle Challenger                disaster, although NASA's solid-rocket boosters have been redesigned                with heaters to alleviate much of that threat.                                 Seven astronauts, led by commander Scott Altman, will use the 11-day                mission to retrofit the orbiting telescope with a new camera, more                efficient solar array wings and a new power system.                                 Astronauts Duane ""Digger"" Carey, John Grunsfeld, Nancy Currie, Jim                Newman, Rick Linnehan and Mike Massimino will share duties ranging                from spacewalks to operating Columbia's robot arm to filming the                work.                                 The mission calls for five straight days of spacewalks, about 33                hours altogether.                                 With the launch delay, Columbia is to return to KSC at about 4:30                a.m. March 12.                                                     Feb                27, 2002                 Hubble awaits Columbia: Shuttle to carry                 repair team to telescope early Friday                 By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                                CAPE CANAVERAL -- NASA will dispatch a team of seven astronauts                Friday morning to polish its crown jewel of astronomy, the Hubble                Space Telescope.                                 The orbiting observatory has glimpsed galaxies on the edge of the                universe already, but a series of improvements during the mission                promise more clarity and more discoveries.                                 Veteran astronaut Scott Altman leads the crew with rookie pilot                Duane Carey. John Grunsfeld, Rick Linnehan, Jim Newman and Mike                Massimino will perform five straight days of spacewalks during the                11-day mission. Nancy Currie will maneuver the shuttle's robot arm                through several complex procedures.                                 Cold weather got the best of Columbia today. Shuttle managers decided                to delay the Thursday scheduled launch for one day to hold out for                better weather Friday. The new launch time is 6:22 a.m. The weather                forecast for Friday calls for an 80 percent chance of acceptable                weather, and temperatures at least 10 degrees warmer than Thursday.                                                Cold weather was a culprit in the 1986 Challenger disaster when                O-rings sealing the joints of the twin solid rocket boosters hardened,                allowing searing flames to leak out and destroy the external tank.                It was 36 degrees at liftoff that morning, but dropped well below                freezing the night before.                                 The boosters now carry heaters for the joints, so the concern lies                with ice building up on the external tank, NASA Test Director Pete                Nickolenko said. Officials fear ice chunks could ding Columbia's                vital heat shield tiles during liftoff.                                 The agency has never scrubbed a shuttle launch solely because of                cold weather, Priselac said.                                 Engineers also are analyzing a wheel bearing on Columbia, Shuttle                Program Manager Ron Dittemore said. They want to make sure the right                tests were performed on the bearings. There is a fear failed bearings                could cause the shuttle to skid at landing.                                 ""It tends to not roll very far after you lose the wheel bearing,""                Dittemore said.                                 The launch could be the easiest part of the mission for the crew                of seven, given the complexity of their job in space.                                 Upgrading the Hubble Space Telescope requires five spacewalks, a                perilous electrical shutdown of the observatory and hours of delicate                maneuvers with the robot arm.                                 NASA launched three previous repair and maintenance flights, but                a combination of intricate work and high risk make this mission                the most complex ever attempted, NASA officials said.                                 ""I used to think nothing would ever surpass the (first Hubble repair)                mission until I had an in-depth review of this mission,"" said Ed                Weiler, associate administrator for Space Science.                                 Astronauts will add several components to the telescope:                · A state-of-the-art camera 10 to 20 times more powerful than those                onboard.                · A smaller set of solar arrays that will provide 20 percent more                electricity.                · A control system that will direct electricity throughout the satellite.                                · A new guidance wheel to help point the mirror precisely.                 · A mechanical cooler to resurrect the telescope's infrared camera                that sees different light than other cameras.                                ""Looking at it as one big project, it's daunting,"" astronaut Jim                Newman said. ""We have to break it down into manageable pieces.""                                                While all of the new parts hold promise, the electrical control                system wrenches planners and astronauts with worry because it means                turning off the telescope completely for the first time in 11 years.                If it does not turn back on, astronomers will lose a scientific                instrument that made more discoveries than all its predecessors                combined.                                 ""It violates a long-standing rule in the space business that if                something's working well you don't turn it off and just hope it                comes back on,"" Weiler said. ""We fully anticipate that everything                will work, but it is something we've never done before.""                                 The electrical unit, which works much like a circuit breaker box                in a house, has deteriorated in space and cycles about 15 percent                less energy from the electricity-generating solar arrays to the                telescope's power-hungry instruments.                                 ""It wouldn't have to get much worse to threaten the ability to do                science,"" said Preston Burch, Hubble project manager.                                 Replacing it with a new model requires astronauts John Grunsfeld                and Rick Linnehan to work with specialized tools on the box and                wires that were never designed for such servicing. Most of the telescope's                other components were built into modules that can be replaced relatively                quickly and easily.                                 The replacement is scheduled for the third spacewalk of the mission.                                                ""We're going to be sitting on the edge of our seats,"" Burch said.                                                Hubble's success during the past 11 years is the main reason for                the worry.                                 The agency spent almost $7 billion on the orbiting telescope since                it was planned in the late 1970's. It costs $10 million a month                to operate, and every shuttle mission to service it runs at least                $500 million before considering the specialized equipment needed.                                                Burch said the gear for Thursday's flight alone cost $172 million.                                                Now seen as a bargain, the Hubble was considered a boondoggle during                most of its development thanks to technical problems and schedule                delays that kept it grounded seven years longer than planned. The                label seemed etched in stone when the telescope returned blurry                photographs of the cosmos due to a flawed main mirror.                                 Weiler said he felt like he was in the deepest hole in the desert,                and no one was eager to help him find the light.                                 ""We had a tough time digging out of that hole in Death Valley,""                he said.                                 Three years later, a group of astronauts fitted the telescope with                a set of glasses, and the telescope began living up to its promise.                                                Regular discoveries erased memories of flawed mirrors and led to                more than 3,200 technical papers.                                 During its 11 years looking out at space, the observatory has taken                420,000 photographs. Its highlights include:                 · Measuring the size of the universe and reliably estimating its                age.                 · Discovering black holes are common, and may exist at the center                of every galaxy.                 · Analyzing the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system.                                · Discovering the universe is accelerating instead of slowing down.                                · Finding an enigmatic force called dark energy.                                 ""When people think of space exploration, they tend to think of men                on moon walking around exploring it,"" Grunsfeld said. ""Hubble is                about exploring the whole rest of the universe from the moon on                out.""                                 Friday's launch will mark the return of Columbia, the oldest of                NASA's four-shuttle fleet. The spacecraft, which first flew in April                1981, spent months in a Boeing hangar in California undergoing a                major overhaul and exhaustive inspections on miles of wiring.                                 Damaged wires caused a short circuit during Columbia's July 1999                liftoff.                                 The glitch shut down a computer controlling one of Columbia's three                main engines, nearly causing a catastrophe. A back-up computer took                over and the launch proceeded safely. The rest of the fleet was                grounded several months for wiring inspections on each orbiter in                1999.                                 While shuttles Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour returned to space                duty, Columbia spent extra time in the shop.                                 The work continued at Kennedy Space Center with more testing and                technicians adding the components needed to make the craft space-worthy                again.                                 ""The vehicle is in great shape and ready to fly,"" NASA Test Director                Steve Altemus said.                                                     Jan                31, 2002                 Crew faces challenges with Hubble                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- Working on one of the world's most sophisticated satellites                while wearing bulky gloves and a spacesuit will never be easy, one                of the spacewalkers preparing to service the Hubble Space Telescope                said Thursday.                                 ""It's designed to be serviced by astronauts, but there's always                surprises,"" said John Grunsfeld, one of four astronauts who will                take turns making five spacewalks to repair some of the telescope's                most sensitive components.                                 Some of the work, such as connecting a new power system, will be                akin to plugging a telephone into a wall jack while wearing boxing                gloves. They will also install a new camera inside the satellite,                recharge a defunct infrared device and replace a faulty reaction                wheel that helps point the$2 billion observatory.                                 Astronauts spent hundreds of hours practicing in a giant swimming                pool to simulate working in space, Grunsfeld said. He performed                two spacewalks during a December 1999 mission to service the space                telescope.                                 This will be the second flight aboard Columbia for mission commander                Scott ""Scooter"" Altman. It will be his third flight overall.                                 Rookie Duane ""Digger"" Carey will pilot Columbia during the first                mission of his career. Grunsfeld, Richard Linnehan, James Newman                and first-time flyer Michael Massimino will take turns performing                five demanding spacewalks.                                 ""I feel like the luckiest rookie astronaut since Alan Bean,"" Massimino                said. ""Al Bean got to walk on the moon on his first flight and I                get to spacewalk on the Hubble.""                                 Nancy Currie will operate the shuttle's robot arm during critical                maneuvers to place the telescope on its work platform in Columbia's                cargo bay.                                 At the launch pad, workers gave Columbia's cargo bay a final cleaning                before the specialized pallets and equipment to service the telescope                are placed inside.                                                     Jan                28, 2002                 Crawler inches Columbia to launch pad                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                                CAPE CANAVERAL -- As shuttle Columbia made its trip to launch pad                39A on Monday, 30 people kept the massive crawler transporter running                with the goal of placing the $2 billion shuttle within an eighth                of an inch of the target area.                                 Wide as an interstate and as long as four tractor-trailers, each                of Kennedy Space Center's two 6-million pound crawlers combine the                low-tech brute force of a tracked vehicle with exquisite precision                to deliver the shuttles to their launch pads, all at less than 1                mph. Slowly, it pulverizes river rock to dust as it travels 31/2                and 5 miles to pad 39A and 39B.                                 These crawlers -- which once bore the massive Saturn 5 rockets of                the Apollo era -- still bear the weight of the nation's manned space                program. A problem with either or both of the crawlers literally                brings the program to a standstill, as it did last week.                                 ""There's only two, and without them you don't have a space program,""                Vickery said.                                 Ten United Space Alliance engineers took turns driving Columbia                out to the launch pad Monday for its Feb. 28 mission. Technicians                and spotters took their places around the machine, giving instructions                over walkie-talkies.                                 The move, called ""rollout"" in KSC parlance, was delayed several                days when the crawler's steering mechanism stuck. Columbia was supposed                to rollout last Wednesday. The delay will not set back the launch                date, NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.                                 An F-15 jet fighter buzzed through the clouds over the shuttle as                it inched down the custom-made crawlerway. NASA's Huey security                chopper flew laps close to the ground while an observation plane                circled the launch complex.                                 Crawler drivers can only see straight ahead and to the right because                the vehicle blocks the other side and back from view. It's like                seeing one tire while driving a car, and steering it solely by keeping                that tire near the curb. An advantage is the crawler moves less                than 1 mph.                                 ""You think of how many billions of dollars of hardware are on your                back and you get a little nervous,"" said Tom Chabrak, United Space                Alliance's lead engineer for the crawler transporters at KSC. ""If                you try not to have that as your major focus and just drive straight,                you won't even know you have a shuttle on top.""                                 Emerging from the Vehicle Assembly Building, Columbia, the external                fuel tank and pair of solid booster rockets resembled a tower bolted                to an office complex on top of a shopping center. Unlike those structures                typically built in place, this one moves.                                 Slowly.                                 It takes six hours to roll to the launch pad. An orbiting shuttle                makes three trips around the Earth in that amount of time.                                 ""You don't really have the wind blowing through your air at 9/10s                of a mile per hour,"" Vickery said.                                 Revving up the crawler and driving it as fast as, say, 2 mph is                out of the question.                                 ""We'd all love to crank it up a lot faster, but then it becomes                a danger aspect,"" Chabrak said. ""If you're up over 1 (mph) and then                one of these belts broke and you weren't able to get it stopped                in time you could really hurt somebody.""                                 The two driving cabs on each crawler are big enough for two people,                but are more reminiscent of a ship's bridge than a car. There's                a brake pedal and small red steering wheel and push-button gear                box -- forward, neutral and reverse. A dial substitutes for a gas                pedal.                                 The gray interior of the engine room, with its steel grate walkways                and two 2,750 horsepower diesel engines, also correspond to Navy                craft more than spacecraft. For example, the pumps that steer the                treads are the same used to turn battleship turrets.                                The engines turn electric generators sending a current to 16 motors                that turn the treads. A secondary generator provides power for lights,                computers and air-conditioners onboard.                                 ""We're basically a big electric vehicle,"" Chabrak said.                                 The diesel muffler beneath the machine is as long as some cars.                Chugging diesels and spinning generators make the engine room a                miniature purgatory of heat and noise when the machine is running.                Some corners of the interior reach 130 degrees, and produce 112                decibels of sound.                                 Workers are limited to 20 minutes at a time watching over the gauges                inside the compartment. Insulated from the heat and noise, technicians                sit in front of a bank of touch-screen computers monitoring the                crawler's health and keep the launch platform and shuttle level.                Hydraulic jacks raise one end of the crawler to keep the shuttle                steady as it climbs the 10-degree incline to the launch tower.                                There are only eight bolts holding the shuttle to the launch platform,                so controllers work to avoid any swaying or tilting.                                 As they approach the launch pad, drivers turn to a yellow screen                with crosshairs etched in it. A laser from the launch pad produces                digital crosshairs that drivers use to match with the permanent                marks. A perfect alignment leaves the shuttle bolted down for launch                while the crawler moves several miles away.                                 The process is identical to the one the crawlers used in the 1960's                moving Saturn 5 moon rockets to the same launch pads the shuttle                uses today. The launch pad and mobile launch platforms were modified                to handle the shuttles. The crawlers' evolution centered largely                on the control room, where modern computers replaced aging systems.                Mechanically, the gears, tread cleats and other parts are unchanged                from when the machines were constructed at KSC.                                 In fact, finding parts for the behemoth is the biggest challenge                to keeping them working. That problem was evident last week when                the crawler broke down and the second was not in condition to take                over.                                 Replacement parts have to be custom-made or the older parts must                be repaired to keep the massive machines operating.                                                     Jan                24, 2002                 Crawler delay strands Columbia at least two more days                 By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 The                space shuttle Columbia sits inside the Vehicle Assembly Building                at Kennedy Space Center on Thursday after the crawler, which transports                it to the launch pad, developed steering problems. The shuttle,                stacked to begin its mission, is stuck in the Vehicle Assembly Building                while mechanics try to repair the baseball infield-sized crawler                transporter that is supposed to carry Columbia to the launch pad                39A.                                 The spacecraft has been stranded inside the hangar since Wednesday.                NASA and United Space Alliance officials hope to move Columbia,                its external tank and booster rockets to the launch pad Saturday                morning, but may wait until Monday if the weather looks good, NASA                spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.                                 ""If Monday looks like it's going to be great, then they'll go Monday,                otherwise they'll go Saturday,"" he said.                                 The crawler developed steering problems that locked one of its tread                sets out of alignment. Mechanics worked on the machine but could                not replace a faulty bearing in time to move the shuttle Thursday.                They also are inspecting the vehicle's three other treadsets.                                 Maintenance work on the second crawler is keeping it from being                a replacement. ""It's unusual to have crawler problems of this magnitude                delaying the shuttle days in a row,"" Buckingham said. The rollout                delay will not set back Columbia's Feb. 28 launch date, Buckingham                said.                                 NASA and USA have six days in their preparation schedule to make                up for lost time. The crawlers, built on-site at Kennedy Space Center                in the mid-1960's, are the only vehicles large enough to lift a                launch-ready shuttle and its platform and carry the 12 million pounds                31/2 miles to an oceanside launch complex.                                 The move will be Columbia's first to the launch pad since July 1999,                when it lofted the Chandra X-ray telescope into space.                                This time, the orbiter's mission is to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.                                                     Jan                10, 2002                 Mission reset for Feb. 28                   By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- NASA postponed shuttle Columbia's repair mission to                the Hubble Space Telescope by a week in an anticipated move Thursday,                officials said.                                 The agency's oldest orbiter will wait while engineers prepare a                new reaction wheel for the orbiting telescope, Kennedy Space Center                spokesman Jack King said. The device is one of four that carefully                points the $2 billion observatory at targets light years away.                                 A brief glitch with one of the wheels alarmed engineers in November                because it left the observatory without a reliable backup should                another wheel fail.                                 A sunrise launch is scheduled for 6:52 a.m. Feb. 28.                                 Managers hoped to launch Columbia on Feb. 21, but the spare wheel                would not have been ready. The instrument and its duplicate are                wrapping up tests before they will be trucked to Kennedy Space Center                and loaded into the orbiter.                                 Two spacewalkers are expected to take about an hour to remove the                questionable mechanism and install a new one. Other missions also                may wait.                                                      May                2, 2001                   Hubble Telescope to Receive More Upgrades                By Kelly Young                 FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Hubble Space Telescope has spent a little                more than 11 years in Earth's orbit. On paper, its life is more                than half over. But scientists say its best days are still ahead.                                                Astronomers at Tuesday's Space Congress were already gearing up                for another mission to upgrade Hubble. The flight of shuttle Columbia,                the orbiter's first mission since its own upgrade, is scheduled                to lift off no earlier than Nov. 19.                                 This telescope servicing mission, like the three that preceded it,                will add capability to the telescope and extend humanity's reach                into the universe.                                 ""It's actually a lot cheaper . . . than to put up new telescopes,""                said Steve Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute,                the research group that operates Hubble.                                 The astronauts will add a cooling system to a near-infrared camera                that lost its eyesight when it ran out of coolant. The new device,                which was tested during John Glenn's return flight in 1998, seeks                to restore that vision to look at the distant universe and areas                of the universe hidden by dust.                                 They also will attach a new instrument, called the Advanced Camera                for Surveys, which is projected to be 10 times more powerful than                the current camera for scanning the heavens.                                 Hubble's next targeted areas will include how galaxies formed in                the early universe and how they came to look the way they do.                                While abstract concepts such as ""dark matter"" and ""dark                energy"" intrigue scientists, it's matter as most humans know                it that captures public interest.                                 ""Because of the complexity of life that has arisen on Earth,                this tiny amount of matter holds a great deal of interest,""                Beckwith said.                                 The telescope's successor, the Next Generation Space Telescope is                expected to launch as early as 2007. One of its goals will be to                look for planets outside our solar system through eclipses.                                 Already, Hubble is able to tell when 1.5 percent of a star's light                is blocked out by a planet passing in front of it. So the future                telescope should provide an even clearer image of distant planetary                systems, Beckwith said.                                   March                26, 2001                 Final Crew Picked for Hubble Overhaul Mission posted                 FLORIDA TODAY                                 Three                astronauts have been named to complete the STS-109 crew already                in training for a mission that will feature five spacewalks to upgrade                the Hubble Space Telescope later this year. Shuttle astronauts will                install an advanced camera for surveys, a device to mechanically                cool science instruments and new high-power solar arrays.                                 Scott Altman, (Cmdr., USN), a two-time shuttle veteran, will command                the STS-109 mission. He will be joined on the flight deck by pilot                Duane Carey, (Lt. Col., USAF), making his first space flight, and                flight engineer Nancy Currie (Lt., USA, Ph.D.). Currie has three                previous space flights to her credit.                                 They join the previously assigned crew members -- payload commander                John Grunsfeld, James Newman, Richard Linnehan and Michael Massimino.                                                STS-109 will mark Altman's first flight as commander, having previously                flown as pilot on STS-90 in 1998 and STS-106 in 2000. Currie, who                brings extensive experience as a flight engineer and robotic arm                operator, flew on STS-57 in 1993, STS-70 in 1995 and STS-88 in 1998.                A space rookie, Carey was selected as an astronaut in 1996.                                 Grunsfeld has flown three times, STS-67 in 1995, STS-81 in 1997                and STS-103 in 1999 when he performed two spacewalks to service                the Hubble Space Telescope. Newman, veteran of three space flights,                STS-51 in 1993, STS-69 in 1995 and STS-88 in 1998, has conducted                four previous spacewalks. Linnehan flew on STS-78 in 1996 and STS-90                in 1998. Massimino is a member of the 1996 astronaut class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Glossary                 |  FAQ  |  Links                                                Talk to Us!                                                                                                                                  :::::: Contact:  webmaster@sm3b.gsfc.nasa.gov           | Global Science & Technology, Inc. ::::::                                       |          Page Last Updated:  April 23, 2002 |"

Before facing those postponements,       the third Hubble Space Shuttle servicing mission had been advanced       in the mission schedule. The servicing mission was originally scheduled       for June 2000, but when the third of Hubbles six gyroscopes failed,       the mission was split into two separate missions. The first mission,       STS-103, was scheduled for Oct. 14 with the second mission to follow       in 2001. (Hubble needs at least three of its six gyroscopes to be       functioning to enable the telescope to point precisely at distant       astronomical targets for scientific observation.)       In mid-August Shuttle managers decided       to extend wiring inspections and maintenance across the Shuttle       fleet after wiring problems were detected aboard Columbia. That       orbiter was inspected and determined to have wiring problems after       an irregularity occurred during the launch of STS-93 on July 23,       1999. Following inspections of Discovery, a new target launch date       of no earlier than Oct. 28 was announced (first launch delay).       Because of the amount of wiring repairs       needed, the planning date was shifted to no earlier than Nov. 19       (second delay). Shuttle managers decided to preserve the option       to launch either STS-103 or STS-99, the Space Radar Topography Mission,       first.       On Nov. 13, a fourth gyroscope on Hubble       failed and the observatory was put into safe mode, a state of       dormancy in which the telescope aims itself constantly at the sun       to provide electrical power to its systems.       As repairs to Discovery came to a close,       launch was targeted for Dec. 2. The launched date was put under       review after a half-inch-long drill bit was discovered to be lodged       in main engine No. 3. A new launch date of Dec. 6 was set (third       delay). Rollout to the pad proceeded and Discoverys main engine       No. 3 was replaced while the orbiter was on the pad.       After Discovery reached the pad, additional       damaged wiring, which was found in an umbilical between the orbiter       and the external tank, was detected and a new launch date of Dec.       9 was set to allow for repair and testing (fourth delay). The launch       was then reset to Dec. 11 (fifth delay). The new target date allowed       KSC workers to observe the Thanksgiving Holidays.       The mission was again put on hold after       a dented main propulsion system line which carries liquid hydrogen       fuel for the Shuttle main engines was found during closeout inspections       of Discovery's engine compartment. A new target date of no earlier       than December 16 was set (sixth delay).       By Dec. 13, workers at Launch Pad 39B       had completed inspections and leak checks on Shuttle Discovery's       replaced liquid hydrogen recirculation line that was replaced and       the target date confirmed to be Dec. 16.       On Tuesday, Dec. 14, 1999, the launch       countdown for STS-103 began on schedule at 1:30 a.m. Later that       day during routine inspections of the external tanks pressure lines,       a suspect weld was detected. To ensure that the proper welding materials       and procedures were used, a thorough review of process and paperwork       used during the fabrication of the lines was conducted. It was determined       that the same manufacturer performed welds on the 17-inch propellant       feed lines and struts in the AFT engine compartment when Discovery       was constructed. A 24 -hour delay was called to give the Shuttle       team time to review the manufacturing inspection records for those       lines as well. It was determine the welds were correctly made and       the launch was rescheduled to Dec. 17 (seventh delay).       On Dec.17, with an 80 percent chance       of unfavorable weather, external tank cyrogenic loading was started       at 11:29 a.m. EST. Tanking operations were complete at 3:00pm EST.       The launch countdown proceeded to the T-minus 9 minute mark and       held due to weather constraints. At 8:52pm EST the launch director       scrubbed the launch due to violations of weather launch commit criteria       and the launch was rescheduled to Dec. 18 (eighth delay).       Due to the prediction of poor weather       on Dec. 18, the mission management team decided to preserve a launch       option and rescheduled Discovery's launch from Dec. 18 to Dec. 19       at 7:50pm EST (ninth delay).       On Dec. 19, 1999, the weather outlook       was favorable, so Shuttle managers decided to proceed with the STS-103       launch countdown. The Shuttle launched on time at the beginning       of the 42 minute window.       To ensure that all flight and ground       systems were secured for the transition to Year 2000, the mission       was shortened from 10 days to 8 days.                             Landing       Information                             R unway 33, Kennedy Space Center,       Fla. Rollout distance 7,005 feet. Rollout time: 47 seconds. Mission       duration: 7 days, 23 hours, 10 minutes, 47 seconds. Landed on orbit       119, logging more than 3.267 million miles. It marked the 13th nighttime       landing in the shuttle program and the 8th at Kennedy Space Center.                                           Mission    Highlights                       S TS-103 restored the Hubble Space    Telescope to working order and upgraded some of its systems, allowing    the decade-old observatory to get ready to begin its second scheduled    decade of astronomical observations.       The first few days of the 8-day mission,    the crew prepared for the rendezvous and capture of the Hubble Space Telescope    and the three maintenance spacewalks to follow. After a 30-orbit chase.    Commander Brown and Kelly maneuvered the orbiter to a point directly beneath    Hubble, then moved upward toward it. Mission Specialist Clervoy grappled    Hubble using the orbiters robotic arm and placed it on the Flight Support    System in the rear of Discoverys cargo bay.       EVA No. 1: Mission Specialists Steven Smith    and John Grunsfeld conducted the missions first spacewalk. The two made    numerous repairs, including replacing the telescopes three Rate Sensor    Units  each containing two gyroscopes. They also installed six Voltage/Temperature    Improvement Kits between Hubbles solar panels and its six 10-year-old    batteries. The kits, the size of cell telephones, were designed to prevent    any overheating or overcharging of those batteries. A few minor objectives    were left undone, such as taking close-up photos of the Voltage/Temperature    Improvement Kits. The 8-hour, 15-minute space walk was second to the longest    space walk from Endeavour on STS-49 in May 1992. A few minor problems    Specialist helped account for the length of the space walk. The astronauts    had difficulty in removing one of the old RSUs, and opening valves and    removing caps on the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer.    The tasks were eventually completed.       EVA No. 2: During the missions second space    walk, Mission Specialists Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier installed    a new advanced computer  20 times faster than Hubbles old one  and    a new, 550-pound fine guidance sensor. This 8-hour, 10 minute space walk    was the third longest in history. With all major activities accomplished,    controllers reported that power was reaching both of the new pieces of    equipment. The brains of Hubble have been replaced, said Mission Specialist    Grunsfeld. About 30 minutes later, Hubble began thinking with those new    brains.       EVA No. 3: Smith and Grunsfeld again teamed    up to make the missions third and final space walk. Like the first two,    it also lasted more than 8 hours, making it the fourth longest in history.    The team installed a transmitter that sends scientific data from Hubble    to the ground. It replaced one that failed in 1998. The astronauts used    special tools developed for the task because transmitters, usually very    reliable, were not designed to be replaced in orbit. Smith and Grunsfeld    also installed a solid state digital recorder, replacing an older mechanical    reel-to-reel recorder.       Hubble was released from Discoverys cargo    bay on Christmas Day.       Mission STS-103 is the third time in the    U.S. Space Program that a crew has spent Christmas in space.

GX015-38-16269085	"40 EVA's and Counting                   STS-6 (April 4 to April 9, 1983)   Was the first on orbit demonstration of the newly developed space suit (EMU) for extravehicular activities (EVAs).  Astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson evaluated EMU mobility, management of the safety tethers, use of the portable foot restraint (PFR), and verified contingency procedures for the inertial upper stage (IUS) tilt table, which is used for satellite deployment.     STS-41B (February 3 to February 11, 1984)   Was the first on orbit demonstration of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).  During the second Shuttle EVA, the 10.2 psi cabin prebreathe protocol was used for the first time.  Astronauts Bruce McCandless and Robert Stewart evaluated the MMU, the mobile foot restraint (MFR) while mounted on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), the Landsat refueling tool, and the hand-held EVA power tool.  The crew demonstrated the concept of docking to satellites with the trunnion pin attachment device (TPAD).  In addition, they retrieved a portable foot restraint (PFR) which had accidentally floated off.     STS-41C (April 6 to April 13, 1984)   Was the first time a Shuttle EVA was performed for commercial purposes.  During the EVA, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson rendezvoused with a rotating satellite using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).  It was the first on orbit repair of a satellite by EVA personnel.  During the repair, the astronauts replaced a failed Automatic Control System module (this task was designed for EVA servicing) and repaired the coronagraph/ polarimeter of the satellite (was not designed for EVA servicing).     STS-41G (October 5 to October 13, 1984)   Was the first EVA performed by an American woman, Kathryn Sullivan.  The EVA crew demonstrated that orbital refueling of Landsat type satellites is possible.  Also, the astronauts repositioned a Ku-band antenna that was unresponsive to movement commands for stowage.     STS-51A (November 8 to November 16, 1984)   Astronauts Joseph Allen and Dale Gardner, wearing Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU), retrieved the malfunctioning satellites WESTAR and PALAPA, both deployed on Mission STS-41B. To capture the satellites, the astronauts used an engine nozzle docking tool called ""the stinger.""      STS-51D (April 12 to April 19, 1985)   The first unscheduled EVA was performed after the SYNCOM-3 satellite booster failed to fire after deployment.  Astronauts David Griggs and Jeffrey Hoffman attached a ""flyswatter"" device to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) end effector, which was used to hook a timing lever on the satellite.  Although this effort was unsuccessful, the readiness of the EMU hardware and of the nominally trained EVA crew was demonstrated.     STS-51I (August 27 to September 3, 1985)   Astronauts William Fisher and James van Hoften performed two extravehicular activities (EVAs) to capture, repair and redeploy the SYNCOM-3 satellite deployed during the STS-51D mission.  This was the first time that EVA crewmembers manually captured, handled and deployed a 6800 kg (15,000 lb.) satellite.       STS-61B (November 26 to December 3, 1985)   Two EVA based experiments were conducted to test the assembly of erectable structures in space: Experimental Assembly of Structures in Extravehicular Activity (EASE) and Assembly Concept for Construction of Erectable Space Structure (ACCESS).  During the first spacewalk, astronauts Sherwood Spring and Jerry Ross erected the tetrahedron EASE structure using an ""assemble as you go"" method of construction -- the crew worked at the end of the structure to further erect the assembly.  During the second EVA, which evaluated the ACCESS experiment, the structure was moved out from the payload bay, while the crewmembers remained at their ""workstation"" inside the payload bay.     STS-37 (April 5 to April 11, 1991)   Jerry Ross and Jay Apt performed the first unscheduled EVA since April 1985, during which they freed and manually deployed the antenna of the Gamma Ray Observatory satellite.  The following day, the two astronauts performed the first scheduled spacewalk since November 1985 to test means for astronauts to move themselves and equipment around.  These procedures were verified to plan future operations for maintenance and resupply of the International Space Station as accurate as possible.     STS-49 (May 7 to May 19, 1992)   First U.S. orbital flight to feature four extravehicular activities (EVAs), one of which was the first spacewalk to involve three crewmembers working simultaneously outside the Space Shuttle.  The crew successfully captured and redeployed INTELSAT VI, which was launched onboard a Titan rocket in March 1990.  During the first and second EVA's, astronaut Pierre Thout tried to attach the capture bar onto the satellite while positioned on the end of the RMS arm.  However, both attempts failed.  During the third EVA, performed by astronauts Thout, Richard Hieb, and Tom Akers, the satellite was successfully captured and placed atop the perigee kick motor, which allowed successful deploy the next day.  The fourth EVA was performed by astronauts Akers and Kathryn Thornton to verify maintenance and assembly capabilities for the International Space Station.     STS-54 (January 13 to January 19, 1993)   Astronauts Mario Runco and Greg Harbough performed a series of extravehicular tasks designed to increase knowledge about working in space; the astronauts tested their abilities to move about freely in the Shuttle's payload bay, climbed into foot restraints without using hands, and simulated how to carry large objects.     STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993)   The EVA scheduled on STS-57 was the second generic EVA performed to test and verify general extravehicular procedures.  In the beginning of their EVA, astronauts Jeff Wisoff and David Low manually stowed the antenna of the EURECA spacecarrier.  This operation was normally accomplished by the automatic antenna retractors, which had malfunctioned.     STS-51 (September 12 to September 22, 1993)   Jim Newman and Carl Walz performed the last generic spacewalks of the series.  The two astronauts evaluated the tools, tethers and foot restraint platform intended to be used during the upcoming Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission (STS-61).     STS-61 (December 2 to December 13, 1993)   During the STS-61 mission, four crewmembers performed five back-to-back spacewalks to repair and maintain the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  During the first EVA, astronauts Story Musgrave and Jeff Hoffman replaced two Rate Sensing Units (RSUs) (gyroscopes) and the Electronic Control Units which direct the RSUs.  The second EVA was performed by astronauts Kathryn Thornton and Tom Akers, during which they jettisoned two solar arrays.  The third EVA, performed by Musgrave/ Hoffman was dedicated to replace one of Hubble's five scientific instruments, the Wide Field/Planetary Camera.  The new unit is able to compensate for the flaw in the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope.  During the fourth EVA (Thornton/Akers) the High-Speed Photometer was removed and replaced by the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit.  The COSTAR redirects light to three of four remaining Hubble instruments and compensates for the flaw in the main mirror for those instruments.  Also, a co-processor was installed to enhance the performance of the HST computer.  During the last EVA, new solar arrays and directing electronics were implemented and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph redundancy (GHRS) kit was installed.     STS-64 (September 9 to September 20, 1994)   Mission Specialists Mark Lee and Carl Meade performed the 28th EVA of the Space Shuttle program.  During the first untethered spacewalk in ten years, the crewmembers tested a new backpack called Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), a device designed to rescue crewmembers which became accidentally untethered.     STS-63 (February 2 to February 11, 1995)   Bernard Harris became the first African-American to perform an extravehicular activity.  Together with his colleague Michael Foale, he tested the isolation of the space suit during extreme cold conditions.  This EVA resulted in several modifications of the EMU to improve heat development during dark passes.      STS-69 (September 7 to September 18, 1995)   The 30th EVA performed was dedicated to test techniques that will be used during the construction and assembly of the International Space Station.  Astronauts Jim Voss and Mike Gernhardt verified several preselected techniques.     STS-72 (January 11 to January 20, 1996)   During two EVA's, astronauts Leroy Chiao, Winston Scott and Daniel Barry evaluated the Portable Work Platform (PWP), tested a rigid umbilical cord which will be used during International Space Station construction, and evaluated other ISS assembly hardware and tools.     STS-76 (March 22 to March 31, 1996)   The first U.S. spacewalk outside the Russian Space Station Mir was performed by Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford.  While the Space Shuttle was docked with the Mir, Godwin and Clifford attached the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) on the exterior of Mir's docking module.  The MEEP was designed to study the effets of exposure to the space envrionment on a variety of materials.     STS-80 (November 19 to December 7, 1996)   Two spacewalks were canceled because the hatch of the airlock failed to open.  After return to Earth, engineers located a loose screw as the reason for the malfunction.     STS-82 (February 11 to February 21, 1997)   Five spacewalks were performed by 4 crewmembers during the second Hubble Space Telescope Reservicing mission (HST-2).  Joe Tanner, Greg Harbough, Mark Lee and Steve Smith upgraded several engineering gears and implemented two new science instruments, the Near Infrared Camera (NICMOS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).      STS-86 (September 25 to October 6, 1997)   During the docked phase of the Space Shuttle with the Russian Space Station Mir, Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov removed the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) deployed during the STS-76 mission from the Mir docking adapter.  They also tested the SAFER hardware and verified compatible equipment that will be used during the assembly of Russian and American components of the International Space Station.  Titov became the first non-American to perform a Shuttle-EVA, which was also the third U.S.-Russian joint EVA.     STS-87 (November 19 to December 5, 1997)   Takao Doi became the first Japanese to spacewalk.  Together with astronaut Winston Scott he tested tools and techniques for the assembly of the International Space Station, such as the AERCAM/SPRINT free-flying TV system.  In the beginning of their spacewalk they manually captured the Spartan satellite.  This task shortened the available EVA time for ISS testing purposes, so a second spacewalk was conducted later during the mission.

GX104-69-14384964	"NOAA     Magazine  ||  NOAA Home Page             NOAA SATELLITES HELP SAVE SIX FISHERMEN FROM ATLANTIC OCEAN        January 10, 2002 — Six fishermen     were rescued from the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles off the coast of     North Carolina recently, thanks to environmental satellites in     the international  Search     and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program , Cospas-Sarsat.      (Click NOAA image for larger view of emergency position-indicating     radio beacon, or EPIRB.)        Satellites      operated by  NOAA  and by the     Russian government detected a distress signal from the 53-foot     fishing vessel Mediterranean Sea II Jan. 6. The crew was airlifted     by Coast Guard Search and Rescue teams.         The vessel, 50 miles southeast     of Cape Fear, had electrical and engine room fires, and was without     electricity and engine power in rough seas. A large wave hit     the bow of the ship and destroyed the windscreen on the bridge.     The vessel was taking on water.        The crew manually activated     their 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)     after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding     on the vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected     by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard.        ""While the cause of the     incident is not yet known, six lives were saved by the use of     properly working safety gear such as an EPIRB and life jackets.     With the EPIRB, we were able to quickly find their location and     in this case able to save their lives,"" said LCDR Brendan     McPherson, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard Atlantic     Area Command, headquartered in Portsmouth, Va.         When the Coast Guard received     the distress alert from NOAA, a search was started with air crews     from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., in an HH-60     Jayhawk helicopter, a C-130 Hercules aircraft and an HH-65 Dolphin     helicopter from Coast Guard Air Facility Charleston, S.C.         The first helicopter on scene     was the rescue helicopter from Air Facility Charleston finding     the Mediterranean Sea II almost completely submerged and some     fishermen jumping into the water. All of the fishermen were wearing     survival suits and Personal Flotation Devices. Three fishermen     were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to safety.         The helicopter from Air Station     Elizabeth City arrived shortly and hoisted the three remaining     fishermen to safety from 10-15 foot seas, sustained winds of     25 mph, and gusts nearing 50 mph. The fishermen were taken to     North Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Airport, N.C., in good condition.             The crew of the Mediterranean     Sea II, homeported in Little River, S.C., said they are thankful     their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment     can mean the difference between life and death.         The Cospas-Sarsat system uses     a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits     to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft     in distress. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service represents the     United States in this program, providing satellite platforms     and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control     Center.         NOAA's Geostationary Operational     Environmental Satellites ( GOES )     can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites     in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth     from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission     Control Center at NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data,     and Information Service in Suitland, Md., then automatically     sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 30 countries     participating in the system. More than 12,000 lives have been     saved worldwide since the system became operational in 1982.        NOAA's     National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service  is the nation's primary source of     space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellite and     Data Service operates the nation's environmental satellites,     which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and     other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone     monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA Satellite     and Data Service also operates three data centers, which house     global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth geophysics,     marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and     paleoclimatology.

If your flight is canceled, most         airlines will rebook you on their first available flight to your destination,         at no additional charge. If you are able to find a flight on another airline,         ask the first airline to endorse your ticket to the new carrier. This         could save you a fare increase but there is no rule requiring them to         do this.          Each airline has its own policies         about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements.         If you are delayed, ask the airline if they will pay for meals or a phone         call. Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required         to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled.            Overbooked Flights          Overbooking is not illegal,         and most airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain extent         in order to compensate for “no-shows.” Passengers are sometimes         left behind or “bumped” as a result. When seats are oversold,         the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people         to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation. Airlines         set guidelines for what to offer passengers – money, a free trip,         food, or lodging.           Federal rules protect you         if you have been bumped against your will on most domestic flights or         outbound international flights. The airline must give you a statement         describing your rights. If the airline is not able to get you to your         final destination within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time,         you are entitled to an on-the-spot payment as compensation. The amount         depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay. An airline         may offer you free transportation on a future flight in place of a check         for denied boarding compensation, but you have the right to insist on         a check.          However, to be eligible for         compensation, you must have a confirmed reservation – an “OK”         in the status box of your ticket. You must also meet the airline’s         deadlines for ticketing and check-in.            Delayed or Damaged         Bags           If your bags don’t come         off the conveyor belt, report this to the airline before you leave the         airport. Insist that they fill out a form and give you a copy, even if         they say the bag will be in on the next flight. Also make sure you know:          • the name of the person         who filled out the form;          • a phone number for         follow up.          Confirm that the airline will         deliver the bag to you without charge when it is found; ask them about         this as well.           Some airlines will give you         money to purchase a few necessities. If they don’t provide you with         cash, ask what types of articles would be reimbursable, and keep all receipts.          If a suitcase arrives damaged         – the airline will usually pay for repairs. If an item can’t         be fixed, they will negotiate a settlement to pay you its depreciated         value. The same holds true for belongings packed inside. Of course, airlines         may decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken         item or inadequate packing, rather than the airline’s handling.                    Lost Bags          If your bag is declared officially         lost, you will have to submit a second, more detailed form within a set         time period established by the airline. The information you submit is         used to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Airlines consider         the depreciated value of your possessions, not their original price or         the replacement costs. They can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per passenger         on the amount of money they’ll pay. When your luggage and its contents         are worth more than that, you may want to purchase “excess valuation,”         if available, from the airline when you check in. The airline may refuse         to sell excess valuation on some items that are especially valuable or         breakable, such as antiques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts,         negotiable securities and cash. On international trips, the airline’s         liability limit is $9.07 per pound.           Keep in mind that these limits are maximums. If the depreciated value         of your property is worth less than the liability limit, the airline will         offer this lower amount. If the airline’s settlement doesn’t         fully cover your loss, check your homeowner’s or renter’s         insurance to see if it covers losses away from home. Some credit card         companies and travel agencies offer optional or even automatic supplemental         baggage coverage.                                                                                    This service is       provided by the Federal Citizen Information Center of the        U.S. General Services Administration . If you       have a comment or question, e-mail

Rollout distance: 7,066 feet (2,154 meters) Rollout time:                   one minute, zero seconds. Mission duration: nine days, 23                   hours, 37 minutes, nine seconds. Landed on revolution 150.                   Landed on second opportunity after first waved off due to low                   clouds. Ninth night landing in Shuttle program history and                   fourth at KSC.                                                                                                                                                                                              Mission             Highlights                                                STS-82             demonstrated anew the capability of the Space Shuttle to service             orbiting spacecraft as well as the benefits of human spaceflight.             Six-member crew completed servicing and upgrading of the Hubble             Space Telescope during four planned extravehicular activities (EVAs)             and then performed a fifth unscheduled space walk to repair             insulation on the telescope.               HST             deployed in April 1990 during STS-31. It was designed to undergo             periodic servicing and upgrading over its 15-year lifespan, with             first servicing performed during STS-61 in December 1993. Hawley,             who originally deployed the telescope, operated the orbiter Remote             Manipulator System arm on STS-82 to retrieve HST for second             servicing at 3:34 a.m. EST, Feb. 13, and positioned it in payload             bay less than half an hour later.               Relying             on more than 150 tools and crew aids, Lee and Smith performed EVAs             1, 3 and 5, and Harbaugh and Tanner did EVAs 2 and 4. EVA 1 began at             11:34 p.m. EST, Feb. 13, and lasted six hours, 42 minutes. One of             Hubble's solar arrays was unexpectedly disturbed by gust of air from             Discovery's airlock when it was depressurized, but was not damaged.             Lee and Smith removed two scientific instruments from Hubble, the             Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and Faint Object             Spectrograph (FOS), and replaced them with the Space Telescope             Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Near Infrared Camera and             Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), respectively. STIS expected to             shed further light on supermassive black holes. NICMOS features more             capable infrared detectors and will give astronomers their first             clear view of the universe at near infrared wavelengths between 0.8             and 2.5 micrometers.               EVA             2 began at 10:25 p.m., Feb. 14, and lasted seven hours, 27 minutes.             Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a degraded Fine Guidance Sensor and a             failed Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with new spares. Also             installed a new unit called the Optical Control Electronics             Enhancement Kit, which will further increase the capability of the             Fine Guidance Sensor. During this EVA astronauts noted cracking and             wear on thermal insulation on side of telescope facing sun and in             the direction of travel.               EVA             3 began at 9:53 p.m., Feb. 15, and lasted seven hours, 11 minutes.             Lee and Smith removed and replaced a Data Interface Unit on Hubble,             as well as an old reel-to-reel- style Engineering and Science Tape             Recorder with a new digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) that will             allow simultaneous recording and playback of data. Also changed out             one of four Reaction Wheel Assembly units that use spin momentum to             move telescope toward a target and maintain it in a stable position.             After this EVA, mission managers decided to add EVA 5 to repair the             thermal insulation on HST.               EVA             4 began at 10:45 p.m., Feb. 16, and lasted six hours, 34 minutes.             Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a Solar Array Drive Electronics package             which controls the positioning of Hubble's solar arrays. Also             replaced covers over Hubble's magnetometers and placed thermal             blankets of multi-layer material over two areas of degraded             insulation around the light shield portion of the telescope just             below the top of the observatory. Meanwhile, inside Discovery             Horowitz and Lee worked on the middeck to fabricate new insulation             blankets for HST.               Final             space walk, EVA 5, lasted five hours, 17 minutes. Lee and Smith             attached several thermal insulation blankets to three equipment             compartments at the top of the Support Systems Module section of the             telescope which contain key data processing, electronics and             scientific instrument telemetry packages. STS-82 EVA total of 33             hours, 11 minutes is about two hours shy of total EVA time recorded             on first servicing mission.               Discovery's             maneuvering jets fired several times during mission to reboost             telescope's orbit by eight nautical miles. Hubble redeployed on Feb.             19 at 1:41 a.m. and is now operating at the highest altitude it has             ever flown, a 335- by 321-nautical-mile orbit. Initial checkout of             new instruments and equipment during mission showed all were             performing nominally. Calibration of two new science instruments was             to take place over a period of several weeks with first images and             data anticipated in about eight to 10 weeks. Two more servicing             missions planned for 1999 and 2002.               Performance             of Discovery was nominal throughout the mission.

GX100-91-0238518	"July  - September 2001     On September 25, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal west of Anaktuvuk Pass, AK.  North Slope Borough RCC dispatched a SAR ground team from Anaktuvuk Pass since it was only 15 miles from the village.  The first team returned to the village because of problems with their 8-wheel Argos.  A second team was dispatched to the site and lcoated two stranded people with their 8-wheel Argos stuck in the river. The two people were transported by the SAR team back to Anaktuvuk Pass in good condition.   TWO SARSAT RESCUES   On September 8, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal west of Matagorda Jetties, TX.  Coast Guard District 8 RCC launched a HH-65 helicopter to the site and located the re-named vessel ""Joan Marie II"" taking on water due to adverse weather conditions.  The HH-65 hoisted all three people aboard and transported them to safety.  The owner will arrange salvage.  THREE SARSAT RESCUES   On September 5, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal near Ugasmik Bay, AK.  CGD 17 RCC contacted the registration POC and was told that the vessel was safe in dry dock.  Shortly thereafter, the POC called CGD 17 and said he had loaned his EPIRB to the tug ""Mercury"". CGD 17 launched a HH-60 helicopter to the location and found the ""Mercury"" sinking.  The HH-60 rescued the two POB from the tug and took them to safety.  The barge was cut loose from the tug, but the tug was still sinking.   TWO SARSAT RESCUES    On September 1, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal northwest of Ketchikan, AK.  The F/V ""Joycelyn"" capsized and the four POB abandoned ship, three in survival suits and the fourth, below deck, broke a window and swam free of the vessel.  Coast Guard District 17 RCC (CGD 17 RCC) in Juneau, AK diverted the USCGC ""Anacapa"", which located the three POB on the overturned hull of the vessel and a fourth POB in a life raft.  The USCGC ""Anacapa"" could not reach the vessel due to surrounding fishing nets.  They requested the three POB get into the life boat. CGD 17 RCC was contacted and requested to deploy a helicopter to assist.  The Coast Guard crew removed the fishing nets from the water and recovered the four POB from the life raft with the aid of a rescue swimmer from the helicopter.  The four POB were taken into Crain, AK for emergency medical treatment of hypothermia, shock, lacerations and nausea.  A ""Good Sam"" vessel, the F/V ""Oregon"", was on scene and was directed by the Coast Guard to recover the 406 MHz EPIRB and Coast Guard's data marker buoy.  FOUR SARSAT RESCUES.    On August 28, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal near Nuiqsut, AK.  North Slope Borough Search and Rescue reported an individual with a loaner PLB was  traveling up the Colville River when the prop on his boat failed.  Dispatched by boat, SAR personnel located and towed the individual back to Nuiqsut, AK.    ONE SARSAT RESCUE    On August 28, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal southeast of Yakutat, AK.  Coast Guard District 17 RCC launched a HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter to the location.  CGD 17 RCC located the F/V ""Evelyn-S"", dead in the water, taking on water with a flooded engine room and no electrical power or pumping capabilities.  The mast of the F/V ""Evelyn-S"" declined a pump and requested either a tow or assistance abandoning the ship.  The CG helicopter contacted the F/V ""Gandil"", approximately seven NM away, and coordinated the evacuation of all three crew members from the ""Evelyn-S"" to the ""Gandil"".  Due to weather conditions, the ""Gandil"" was  unable to tow the ""Evelyn-S"" and the vessel was left adrift.  The ""Gandil"" proceeded enroute to Cape Spencer, AK.    THREE SARSAT RESCUES   On August 28, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz EPIRB signal south of Mallorca, Spain.  The owner of the S/V ""Cockoo-Land"" collided with something and began taking on water.  The owner unsuccessfully tried to pump the water out but had to abandon ship into a lifeboat with the 406 MHz EPIRB.  He was later rescued by the crew of the vessel ""Salvamar Castillo De Bellver"" and taken into port in Mallorca, Spain.    ONE SARSAT RESCUE   On August 19, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal near Barrow, AK.  After notification, Alaska North Slope Burrow RCC dispatched a Helicopter to locate the vessel.  After locating the vessel, NSB launched a cutter which arrived on scene and were told the PLB was manually activated after a vessel became stranded.  NSB recovered the three POB and towed the vessel back to Barrow, AK.    THREE SARSAT RESCUES   On August 11, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal south of Newfoundland.  The S/V ""Lally"" was demasted and taking on water due to sea state.  The 2 POB's evacuated into a dinghy to facilitate rescue and were later recovered by tanker M/V ""Shamrock""  Final disposition is S/V ""Lally"" sank with EPIRB on Board.    TWO SARSAT RESCUES    On August 8, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 121.5 MHz distress signal in Arctic Village, AK.  AK RCC diverted resources to the scene of a downed CESSNA 180-A aircraft with tail number ""N81958"".  The AK State Troopers found the aircraft inverted and located the pilot, uninjured.  He was the sole occupant aboard the aircraft.    ONE SARSAT RESCUE   On August 7, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal near the Columbia River Jetty in Washington.  CGD13 RCC used contact numbers from registration data to help find the vessel.  CG rescued one out of three POBs.  The other two remain missing.  The captain told the CG that the ""Miss Brittany"" capsized when hit by a rogue wave while they were setting nets and traps.  The Captain was caught on top with the two other POB below.  ""Miss Brittany"" was later found broken and washed up on shore.  The CG have an ongoing search for the two missing POB.    ONE SARSAT RESCUE   On August 6, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 121 MHz distress signal west of Dillingham, AK.  Alaska Rescue Coordination Center received a signal from a 121.5 ELT on board a PA-18 aircraft, tail number ""N5988Z"", which crashed in Dillingham, AK.  Alaska RCC resources were diverted on scene and picked up the two uninjured survivors.    TWO SARSAT RESCUES    On July 29, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 121 MHz distress signal 45 miles east of Bethel, AK.  Alaska RCC launched a Bell 206 helicopter to the area.  When the helicopter arrived on scene, they found a Supercub aircraft had crashed landed at Pinky's Mine.  There was substantial damage to the aircraft, but only minor injuries to the 2 people aboard.  A bear was circling the aircraft and ran off once the rescue helicopter arrived.  The 2 people were picked up and transported to safety.   TWO SARSAT RESCUES   On July 28, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal southeast of Galveston, TX.  The crew of the diving vessel ""American Liberty"" manually activated their 406 MHz EPIRB due to a main space fire aboard the vessel.  All 17 POBs exited the vessel onto life rafts.  CG District 8 RCC and CG Station Galveston launched Coast Guard vessels and helicopters to the area.  Several vessels responded to the Coast Guard's Urgent Marine Information Broadcast and arrived on scene to assist  the distressed vessel, one was equipped with fire fighting equipment.  All 17 passengers were recovered from lift rafts and taken into port.  After the fire was extinguished aboard the vessel, the ""American Liberty"" was towed by a sister vessel safely into port.  SEVENTEEN SARSAT RESCUES    On July 17, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 121 MHz distress signal north of Eielson AFB, AK.  The Alaska Rescue Coordination Center dispatched the Civil Air Patrol to the scene and located 2 canoeist, one with a severe ear ache. A H-60 helicopter was diverted to the location to retrieve the two people.  They were transported to the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.    ONE SARSAT RESCUE   On July 11, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 406 MHz distress signal west of St. Petersburg, FL.  CG Group St. Pete diverted a C-130 Hercules fixed wing aircraft to the site.  Once on scene they were unable to contact the vessel.  The F/V ""Juma V"" reported the distressed F/V ""Sundancer"" was last heard on FM channel 16 the morning of July 10 and had reported low battery voltage.  The C-130 attempted to establish communications with negative results and conducted a low pass on the vessel to determine the vessel's condition.  People on board waved at the aircraft.  The C-130 dropped a hand held FM radio and established communications on channel 16.  The Master stated all batteries had been completely drained and they were unable to pump the bilge.  He stated a minimal amount of water had accumulated in the bilge, but indicated concern in the event of adverse weather conditions.  The C-130 dropped a dewatering pump to the vessel and contacted a nearby fishing vessel, ""Juma V"", to request their assistance.  The C-130 returned to base due to low fuel.  A company boat was sent out to tow the ""Sundancer"" into port.   THREE SARSAT RESCUES   On July 10, 2001, the COSPAS-SARSAT system detected a 121 MHz distress signal south of Skwentna, AK.

The family had abandoned their sinking, 32-foot fishing vessel. Operated        by NOAA and the Russian government, the satellites are part of Sarsat, the        international Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program, Cospas-Sarsat.                        A Coast Guard helicopter from Cordova came to the family's rescue after        satellites detected a distress signal as the vessel began sinking after        striking a large object.                 As the vessel sank, its 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon        (EPIRB) was manually activated. The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat        system, and NOAA's U.S. Mission Control Center notified the Coast Guard.        The Coast Guard received the EPIRB signal from NOAA at 5:04 a.m., alerting        them of a possible distress in the Gulf. Using the up-to-date information        registered to the activated EPIRB, the Coast Guard determined that Jim Bingman,        39, his son Justin Bingman, 13, and their dog Honey were steaming from Kodiak        to Ketchikan in their 32-foot fishing vessel,  Reaper .                 A Kodiak-based helicopter crew, staged in Cordova, launched at 6:30 a.m.        to search for the three.                ""Because they had current registration information, we were able to quickly        determine the route they were taking, the number of people on board, and        their vessel's description,"" said Petty Officer Doug Green, of the 17th        Coast Guard District Rescue Coordination Center in Juneau. ""You'd be amazed        at how much having that information helps us do our job."" All EPIRBs in        the United States must be registered with NOAA's search and rescue program        office.                 The helicopter crew located the Bingmans in a life raft at 7:40 a.m. The        crew lowered 22-year-old rescue swimmer Petty Officer Chris Mann to conduct        his first rescue. Mann rescued the three from their life raft and swam them        to the rescue basket one at a time as Petty Officer Jeff Kaschalk hoisted        them into the helicopter.                ""The dog was the most difficult to rescue out of the three,"" said Mann.        ""He didn't want to get in the water. I grabbed a hold of the dog, he put        his paws on my arm, and I swam him to the rescue basket,"" said Mann.                ""The Bingmans did 90 percent of the work of being prepared by having a registered        406 EPIRB, having survival suits on, and having their life raft ready,""        said Coast Guard pilot Lt. Cmdr. Guy Pearce. ""When you see that, it takes        a lot of stress out of the rescue because it means these guys are well prepared.""                        ""The Search and Rescue satellite system is truly a humanitarian program,""        said Ajay Mehta, manager of NOAA's Sarsat program. ""To date over 14,000        lives have been saved from boating and aviation accidents around world.""                        The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary        and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft        in distress. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information        Service (NOAA Satellite and Information Service) represents the United States        in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment, and        operating the U.S. Mission Control Center.                NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can instantly        detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect        emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency        signals are sent to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's facility in        Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world.        Today there are 35 countries participating in the system. September of this        year marks the 20th anniversary of the first Sarsat rescue.                 NOAA's Satellite and Information Service is the nation's primary source        of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA's Satellite and Information        Service operates the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for        weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and other environmental applications        such as fire detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements.        NOAA's Satellite and Information Service also operates three data centers,        which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth        geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and        paleoclimatology.

Clinton The White House Washington, DC Dear Mr. President, We are pleased to present you with the report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. You established this Commission by issuing Executive Order 13015 on August 22, 1996 with a charter to study matters involving aviation safety and security, including air traffic control and to develop a strategy to improve aviation safety and security, both domestically and internationally. During the past six months, we have conducted an intensive inquiry into civil aviation safety, security and air traffic control modernization. Commission and staff have gathered information from a broad range of aviation specialists, Federal Agencies, consumer groups, and industry leaders. After many months of deliberations we have agreed on a set of recommendations which we believe will serve to enhance and ensure the continued safety and security of our air transportation system. We are privileged to submit these recommendations herewith. Sincerely,  Vice President Al Gore, Chairman   In compliance with the Executive Order 13015 of August 22, 1996, the undersigned present the report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. _______________________________ Vice President Al Gore, Chairman _______________________________ James A.

The typed version of the final report inadvertently omitted manufacturers from the list of those to whom the Commission expressed appreciation. That mistake has been corrected in this edition. 3. In this edition, typographical errors have been silently corrected. 4. This edition contains as Appendix I a dissent by Commissioner Cummock which was transmitted to the Commission one week after the report was voted on in public session and presented to President Clinton. During the public session, Commissioner Cummock dissented from three recommendations. The dissent published in this document goes far beyond those registered in public. It presents for the first time material and arguments the other Commissioners did not have an opportunity to consider. However, many of the arguments made in the dissent were considered and rejected by the other members of the Commission. Supplemental material included in Commissioner Cummock's dissent is available upon request to Richard K. Pemberton, Office of the Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation.  -1-   Introduction Change. That one word sums up both the challenges in aviation safety and security, and the means by which government and industry must respond. Change is nothing new in this field. The first powered flight, covering 120 feet in twelve seconds, took place just over ninety years ago. Today, planes cross the Atlantic Ocean in a matter of hours, as hundreds of passengers watch movies and dine. An industry that essentially did not even exist before World War I now occupies a central position in our economy. Today, commercial aviation generates over $300 billion annually, and accounts for close to one million American jobs.1 The changes taking place in aviation today are as profound as any this industry has seen before. Since 1992, sixty new airlines have started service, opening up new markets, attracting new passengers, and impacting the economics of the industry significantly.2 The number of passengers flying in the United States over the last decade has grown to more than half a billion. The FAA has certified twenty new aircraft models in the last ten years, and plans are under consideration for a new High-Speed Civil Transport. As dramatic as these changes have been, even more significant change looms on the horizon. Information technology presents opportunities that will again revolutionize the industry, in ways as significant as the introduction of the jet engine forty years ago. Air traffic today is still controlled through ground-based radar, and on a point-to-point basis. Satellite-based navigation will bring a fundamental change in the way that air traffic is directed, and may make the notion of ""highway lanes in the sky"" as obsolete as the bonfires that used to guide early fliers. Digital technology will replace analog systems, making communications with and among aircraft dramatically faster, more efficient, and effective. These and other new technologies offer tremendous opportunities for improved safety, security and efficiency, and will transform aviation in the same way that the Internet and World Wide Web are transforming the way the world does business. Other changes are even more imminent. By the end of the century, the commercial fleet serving the United States will have been completely overhauled, with aircraft that make a fraction of the old noise and emit far less pollution. Continuing success in the United States' efforts to open up foreign markets to competition by our airlines likely will mean more airlines, serving more markets, carrying more people. A continuation of the trend toward greater competition and lower fares will make flying even more available to average Americans than it is today. In fact, the FAA projects that, in 2007, more than 800 million passengers will fly in the United States --- three times the number who flew in 1980.3 This is a time of change for government, as well. President Clinton's declaration that ""the era of big government is over,""4 coalesced a bipartisan drive to make government work -2-   better and cost less. The Administration's commitment to government reform resulted not just from a desire to bring down government spending, but from a recognition that the same types of changes facing industries such as aviation face government, as well. Like the private sector, government must change with the times. The question is, how?  Establishment of the Commission on Aviation Safety and Security President Clinton created the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security to address that question, and assigned it three specific mandates5: to look at the changing security threat, and how we can address it; to examine changes in the aviation industry, and how government should adapt its regulation of it; to look at the technological changes coming to air traffic control, and what should be done to take best advantage of them. In the wake of concerns over the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, President Clinton asked the Commission to focus its attention first on the issue of security. He asked for an initial report on aviation security in 45 days, including an action plan to deploy new high-technology machines to detect the most sophisticated explosives. On September 9, 1996, the Commission presented that initial report to the President. It contained twenty recommendations for enhancing aviation security which are presented again in Chapter 3 of this report. The response to the initial report was unprecedented. In October 1996, at the request of President Clinton, the Congress appropriated over $400 million, in direct accord with the Commission's recommendations, for the acquisition of new explosives detection technology and other security enhancements. In the five months since they were presented, implementation has begun on virtually all of the initial recommendations. From its inception, the Commission took a hands-on approach to its work. President Clinton announced the formation of the Commission on July 25, 1996. A few days later, Vice President Gore led a site visit to Dulles International Airport, where he and other Commissioners saw airport and airline operations first-hand, and discussed issues with front line workers. This was the first of dozens of such visits. Over the next six months, the Commission visited facilities throughout the United States and in various locations abroad. Seeking to reach the broadest possible audience, the Commission established a homepage on the Internet (http://www.aviationcommission.dot.gov), both to make the Commission's work available and to receive input. The web site has had almost 7,000 contacts, many providing valuable insights. The Commission held six public meetings, hearing from over fifty witnesses representing a cross section of the aviation industry and the public, including families of victims of air disasters. Recognizing the increasingly global nature of aviation, the Commission co-sponsored an International Conference on Aviation Safety and Security with the George Washington University, attended by over 700 representatives from sixty-one countries. Out of this extensive process, the Commission compiled the recommendations presented in this final report. -3-   A Vision for the Future To compete in the global economy of the 21st Century, America needs a healthy, vibrant aviation industry. In turn, the health and vibrancy of aviation depend on improved levels of safety, security and modernization. For the last fifty years, the United States has led the field of aviation. But, that position is being challenged, both by competition from abroad and by weaknesses in our own systems. These weaknesses can be overcome. The Commission believes that it should be a national priority to do so. This report outlines steps that can set government and industry on a course to achieve that goal together. Heading into the next century, our activities, programs, and results should define aviation safety and security for the rest of the world. Leadership in aviation goes far beyond having strong, competitive airlines. It means assuring leadership in communications, satellite, aerospace, and other technologies that increasingly are defining the global economy. It means more than the highest possible levels of safety and security for travelers. The Commission's report reflects a focus on this vision: to ensure greater safety and security for passengers; to restructure the relationships between government and industry into partnerships for progress; and to maintain global leadership in the aviation industry.  Key Recommendations In the area of safety, the Commission believes that the principal focus should be on reducing the rate of accidents by a factor of five within a decade, and recommends a reengineering of the FAA's regulatory and certification programs to achieve that goal. In the area of air traffic control, the Commission believes that the safety and efficiency improvements that will come with a modernized system should not be delayed, and recommends that the program be accelerated for to achieve full operational capability by the year 2005. In addition, a more effective system must be established to finance modernization of the National Airspace System and enhancements in safety and security. In the area of security, the Commission believes that the threat against civil aviation is changing and growing, and that the federal government must lead the fight against it. The Commission recommends that the federal government commit greater resources to improving aviation security, and work more cooperatively with the private sector and local authorities in carrying out security responsibilities. Although not specifically directed to do so, the Commission also took up the issue of responding to aviation disasters. In this area, the Commission believes that a better coordinated and more compassionate response is necessary, and that the responsibility for coordinating the response needs to be placed with a single entity. The Commission is pleased -4-   with the progress made to date in this area, including the designation of the National Transportation Safety Board as that single entity. Many of the Commission's recommendations apply equally to each of the three major areas of focus, including those relating to regulation and certification. Primary among these recommendations is the call for greater use of partnerships in meeting goals. Regulatory and enforcement agencies such as the Customs Service, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration have put new emphasis on partnerships with industries, and are achieving tremendous results: seizing more drugs while expediting travel for legitimate travelers; reducing workplace accidents while increasing productivity; and getting important new AIDS and cancer-fighting drugs to market in a fraction of the time it used to take. The premise behind these partnerships is that government can set goals, and then work with industry in the most effective way to achieve them. Partnership does not mean that government gives up its authorities or responsibilities. Not all industry members are willing to be partners. In those cases, government must use its full authority to enforce the law. But, through partnerships, government works with industry to find better ways to achieve its goals, seeking to replace confrontation with cooperation. Such partnerships hold tremendous promise for improving aviation safety and security. A shift away from prescriptive regulations will allow companies to take advantage of incentives and reach goals more quickly. Transportation Secretary Pea's cooperative program with airlines to establish a single level of safety is an example of innovative government-industry partnership. Another is Vice President Gore's January 15, 1997 announcement that Boeing, in concert with government agencies, had developed a plan to modify the rudders on hundreds of its 737 aircraft. By acting without waiting for a government mandate, Boeing will complete many of these safetyenhancing modifications before the government could complete a rule requiring the action. Partnership must extend not only to regulated entities, but also to the various federal agencies involved with aviation safety and security. A number of agencies outside the Department of Transportation have expertise and resources that can have a direct impact on improving safety and security. The Commission urges the Administration to continue to work to expand and improve these intergovernmental relationships. In the last few years, the FAA has begun to recognize and respond to the tremendous changes it faces. Reviews such as the Challenge 2000 report examined ways of improving the way the FAA regulates operators and manufacturers. Now is the time for the FAA to build on that work, and aggressively reengineer itself to adapt to the demands of the 21st Century. It is important to note that the FAA, alone among federal agencies, has been given some critical new tools to help shape its own future. A new Management Advisory Council will provide valuable input to the agency's decision-making process. In 1995, the Congress -5-   granted the Clinton Administration's request for unprecedented reforms of the FAA's personnel and procurement systems. These reforms give the FAA almost unlimited latitude to design new systems to meet the agency's unique and particular needs. The first phases of these reforms were implemented in April 1996, and are already producing dividends. The FAA used to have 233 procurement documents, and today there are less than 50. Using its streamlined process, the FAA recently completed a billion dollar procurement in six months, with no protests. Under the old system, it would have taken three times as long, and likely would have been delayed by costly protests. A stack of personnel rules that used to be onefoot high has been reduced to 41 pages, and will allow the agency to hire people where they're needed and when they're needed. This flexibility will be critical to meeting the challenges of the next century. As former FAA Administrator David Hinson recently noted, this type of reform is ""the seed for what needs to happen at the FAA.""6 The incoming leadership at the Department of Transportation and the FAA must utilize fully the flexibilities that have been granted if the agency is to keep pace with the rapidly changing industry it regulates.  Responsibility for Implementing Change The Commission's goal for aviation in the next century may be summed up by the words of Robert Crandall, Chairman of American Airlines, when he said, ""We would like the public to take safety and security as a given. If that is going to happen, change is necessary.""7 The responsibility for achieving that change lies with all the partners in aviation. The Administration, the Congress, the entire aviation industry and its employees must work together to make the changes that are necessary to keep pace with the challenges facing them. Commitments must be made at the highest levels of every organization, in government and in the private sector. To ensure that the government remains focused on the goals established in this report, the Commission recommends three steps: (1) that the Secretary of Transportation report publicly each year on the implementation status of these recommendations; (2) that the President assign the incoming leadership at the Department of Transportation and the FAA the clear mission of leading their agencies through the necessary transition to re-engineered safety and security programs; and (3) that the performance agreements for these positions, which the documents that senior managers sign with the President outlining their goals and specific means of measuring progress, include implementation of these recommendations.  -6-   Chapter One: Improving Aviation Safety ""The FAA, despite its professionalism and many accomplishments, was simply never created to deal with the environment that has been produced by deregulation of the air transport industry."" Stuart Matthews, President and CEO, Flight Safety Foundation.  8  Commercial aviation is the safest mode of transportation. That record has been established not just through government regulation, but through the work of everyone involved in aviation -- manufacturers, airlines, airport operators, and a highly-skilled and dedicated workforce. Their combined efforts have produced a fatal accident rate of 0.3 per million departures in the United States. The accident rate for commercial aviation declined dramatically between 1950 and 1970. But, over the last two decades, that rate has remained low, but flat.9 Heading into the next century, the overall goal of aviation safety programs is clear: to bring that rate down even lower. Focusing on the accident rate is critical because of the projected increases in traffic. Unless that rate is reduced, the actual number of accidents will grow as traffic increases. Given the international nature of aviation, cutting the accident rate is an imperative not just for the United States, but for all countries involved in aviation. Accident rates in some areas of the world exceed those in the U.S. by a factor of ten or more. Boeing projects that unless the global accident rate is reduced, by the year 2015, an airliner will crash somewhere in the world almost weekly.10 30 60  20 Traffic growth / accident rate 10 Accidents per year ?  40  Accidents Traffic growth in millions of departures  20  Accident rate per million departures 0 1960 ? 1970 1980 1990 Year 2000 2010 0 2015  Source: Boeing  -7-   While fatality rates in general aviation are higher than in commercial operations, the principal causes of general aviation accidents are similar to commercial aviation accidents. The Commission's recommendations will help address the safety of general aviation as well. Lessons from reinventing government must be applied to aviation programs. Improvements in safety and security will result from a focus on several key areas: expanded use of partnerships; reengineering of the FAA's regulatory and certification processes; greater focus on human factors and training; and, the faster introduction of proven new technologies. These technologies are enabling the introduction of increasingly sophisticated automation into virtually every aspect of aviation operations. They offer opportunities for improved safety, security, and efficiency, and are driving the aviation industry toward an integrated system that will alter many of the things that have remained unchanged in aviation for decades. Adapting to these changes will require renewed commitments from all partners, and a willingness to re-engineer long-standing practices and procedures. This change also calls for a cultural transformation of the FAA to improve its ability to regulate and lead the development of the integrated aviation system on the horizon. In the areas of regulation and certification, the Challenge 2000 report represents a good first step. However, it and other internal reviews have not provided a comprehensive, agency-wide assessment of the need for change. That is what is needed. A strong government-industry partnership is needed to develop and integrate the research, standards, regulations, procedures, and infrastructure needed to support the aviation system of the future. The FAA has applied this approach successfully to cooperative research projects with NASA in the development of advanced air traffic technologies. The Commission encourages these agencies and others to expand their cooperative efforts in aviation safety research and development. Regular and random inspection of airlines and facilities should remain an important part of the FAA's safety and security oversight programs. However, given the tremendous growth and globalization in the industry, it is neither realistic nor desirable to expect the FAA to rely on hands-on inspections to ensure safety. It is critical that industry be given the incentives and flexibility to be full partners in this effort, and be encouraged to monitor and improve their own performance. This will not only produce better focus on results, but will also allow the FAA to deploy its resources more effectively.  -8-   Recommendations 1.1 Government and industry should establish a national goal to reduce the aviation fatal accident rate by a factor of five within ten years and conduct safety research to support that goal. Historically, major advances in aviation safety have been driven by technological improvements in airframes, engines, communications, radar and other areas. Today, information technology can help aviation make the next leap forward in safety. Aviation safety experts at the FAA and at NASA are confident that a five-fold reduction in the fatal accident rate could be achieved in the next decade given the right resources and focus. The Commission urges the FAA, NASA and industry to step up to this challenge. Achieving this goal will require the combined efforts of government and industry focused on three objectives: preventing equipment malfunctions; reducing human-caused mishaps; and ensuring separation between aircraft and other air or ground hazards. Government can play a strong role in research and development, but it must be in partnership with industry, which ultimately is responsible for operating safely. The Commission urges NASA, which has considerable expertise and resources in the area of safety research, to expand its involvement in the promotion of aviation safety.  1.2. The FAA should develop standards for continuous safety improvement, and should target its regulatory resources based on performance against those standards. The FAA should promote aviation safety and security by setting high standards, requiring aviation businesses to monitor and improve their own safety performance, and by developing objective methods of measuring the ability of companies to monitor and improve its own safety. Significant efforts have already been made in this direction. Current regulations, for example, require commercial air carriers to implement a Continuing Analysis and Surveillance Program to evaluate the effectiveness of their maintenance and inspection processes. Significant investment and effort have been put into developing the Safety Performance Analysis System, which will allow safety inspectors to compare the performance of similar operators to identify trends that could lead to reduced levels of safety. Such approaches to aviation safety oversight should be broadened. Operators should be encouraged to implement systems that ensure their continued compliance with regulations and that promote continuous improvements in aviation safety and security. Last year, the FAA undertook an independent review of its regulatory and certification programs. That effort, known as Challenge 2000, recommended in part that the agency move toward implementing rules that establish performance standards where possible, and that the rulemaking process be streamlined and reengineered. Further, the report urged that the -9-   regulatory process be restructured to provide compelling technical and business incentives for industry to develop and certify products that help fulfill priority safety needs. The Commission recognizes the value of the Challenge 2000 report, and urges the FAA and industry to work together to develop standards for continuous safety and security improvement that recognize variations in company maturity and best industry practices. These standards should serve as the basis for certification, regulation and oversight of the aviation industry. Objective criteria should be developed that enable the FAA to assess each organization's safety improvement processes and performance, and use this assessment to improve performance throughout the industry. As an incentive to implement effective safety and security improvement programs, FAA oversight should be adjusted to recognize the maturity and actual performance of individual operators and manufacturers. Such an approach will allow the FAA to target its inspector resources on those operators demonstrating the greatest risk, while allowing mature operators and manufacturers to manage their organizations without unproductive FAA involvement. The FAA should adjust its internal classifications and rankings of inspectors to reflect this change. Inspector hours in thousands 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1000 Air South Reeve Amer.

As this chart shows, in 1995 there were far more inspectors overseeing mature, large airlines with established safety records than there were examining start-up carriers.  - 10 -   1.3 The DOT and the FAA should be more vigorous in the application of high standards for certification of aviation businesses. In the past, both the FAA and the DOT have devoted significant resources to helping new companies meet regulatory requirements and manage their operations. The recent 90 Day Safety Review conducted by the DOT and the FAA determined that this is an inappropriate role for the government and recommended many actions that will improve the certification process. The Commission agrees. While the government should assist companies in improving the safety and security of their operations, it should not use its resources to compensate for lack of experience, technical expertise or judgment in a company's day-to-day operations. In some cases, the FAA's certification standards and processes have not kept up with the changing needs of civil aviation. For example, current standards for hiring security personnel do not take into account changes in explosives detection technology. And the certification of engines and airframes still reflects a time when these systems were produced as completely independent systems. Today, engine and airframe development is integrated, so the certification process must take into account the entire system rather than its individual parts. In the future, as the airplane becomes an integral component of the air traffic management system, the certification of the aircraft, as part of an integrated aviation system, will become even more important. The FAA demonstrated its ability to integrate these processes and work effectively with industry in the certification of the Boeing 777 airplane. Lessons from the 777 certification should be applied to the way the FAA certificates airplanes in the future. Additional certification tools and processes should be developed to encourage the introduction of new technologies. Considerable attention has been given to the issue of outsourcing of maintenance and other work, particularly in the wake of the Valujet crash. The Commission does not believe that outsourcing, in and of itself, presents a problem -- if it is performed by qualified companies and individuals. The proper focus of concern should be on the FAA's certification and oversight of any and all companies performing aviation safety functions, including repair stations certificated by the FAA but located outside of the United States,.  1.4. The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) should be simplified and, as appropriate, rewritten as plain English, performance-based regulations. The Commission believes that government can achieve better regulatory compliance if its objectives are stated clearly and its focus is on goals, not process. While that sounds simple, the FAA's rules too often do not meet those criteria. The Commission urges the FAA to take two steps to address this problem. First, as appropriate, all new rules should be rewritten as performance-based regulations, and in plain English. Second, within 18 months, a bottom-up- review of existing regulations should be - 11 conducted to identify those in need of rewriting as performance-based, plain English   regulations. Such clarifications would improve compliance and help the FAA resolve serious problems created by differences in interpretation of regulations by FAA officials across the country. The current FARs and supporting Handbooks, Technical Standards Orders, Security Directives, and Advisory Circulars have become too prescriptive and complex and are increasingly open to misinterpretation. Sometimes they provide conflicting policy or procedural guidance. They often stifle the creativity of those who would do more than the rules require. In many cases, the FARs do not allow for advances in technology that increase security, safety or efficiency. For example, the FARs currently have no provisions for design criteria to protect aircraft from high intensity electromagnetic fields such as those emanating from TV antennas, radars, cellular phones, portable stereos, and laptop computers. These electromagnetic fields are potentially hazardous to aircraft using digital communications, avionics and flight controls. The FAA has been working for more than eight years to develop standard certification requirements to address these hazards, but today each certification is handled through the use of special conditions. Mandating performance rather than dictating procedures will break the regulatory logjam.  1.5. Cost alone should not become dispositive in deciding aviation safety and security rulemaking issues. As noted earlier, the rate of fatal accidents in commercial aviation in the U.S. is less than 0.3 per million departures. The rarity of accidents can make it difficult to justify safety and security improvements under benefit-cost criteria applied to regulatory activities. Nevertheless, benefit-cost analysis can enlighten the regulatory decision-making process. For example, such analysis can help identify the most cost-effective way to achieve a safety or security objective. Cost considerations and mathematical formulas, however, should never be dispositive in making policy determinations regarding aviation safety -- they are one input for decision-making. Further, non-quantifiable safety and security benefits should be included in the analysis of proposals.  1.6. Government and industry aviation safety research should emphasize human factors and training. Over the past ten years, flight crew error accounted for over 60% of all aviation accidents world-wide. And over the past five years, two types of flight crew error, loss of control in flight and controlled flight into terrain, accounted for over 70% of all airline fatalities. Moreover, recent airport testing of explosive detection systems revealed significant deficiencies in the performance of security personnel. Research, technology, training and sharing of safety data can reduce human error. Aviation safety and security have always depended upon a talented and dedicated workforce. Today, changes in technology are presenting that workforce -- flight crews, ground and air traffic controllers, maintenance technicians -- with new challenges. The aviation system will continue to rely on these highly - 12 -   skilled people to be responsible for all aspects of operations, and it is critical to assess and address issues relating to human interaction with changing technologies. The FAA, NASA, the DoD, and the aviation industry jointly developed a National Aviation Human Factors Plan that describes a strategic approach to solving the problem of humancaused mishaps. Two additional studies, one by the FAA dealing with flight deck human factors and the other published by representatives from government, industry, and union organizations as their 1997 Aviation Safety Plan, identify a wide range of safety issues, including human factors. The Commission acknowledges the importance of all three of these reports and urges the immediate development of an implementation plan.  1.7. Enhanced ground proximity warning systems should be installed in all commercial and military passenger aircraft. The introduction of ground proximity warning systems (GPWS) in commercial aircraft in the late-1970s led to significant reductions in controlled flight into terrain, the second-leading cause of aviation accidents. These accidents occur when pilots cannot reconcile their positions with changing terrain. Current GPWS systems are not predictive, however, and only warn pilots when ground impact is imminent. Several recent incidents indicate the need for a forward-looking system that can provide better situational awareness and advanced warning to pilots when they are approaching hazardous terrain. Digital terrain elevation data developed for military purposes can help provide this capability. On January 15, 1997, Vice President Gore announced that the Department of Defense is releasing a version of its global digital terrain elevation database for use in the civilian sector. Combined with advanced navigation systems, this will provide pilots with the tools that they need to reduce, and maybe even eliminate, these kinds of accidents in the future. The Commission applauds the voluntary introduction of advanced ground proximity warning systems in commercial aircraft, and urges all segments of the aviation community to install this vital safety system. To achieve this goal, the Commission urges the FAA to work with industry to develop and promote the use of such equipment in general aviation aircraft.  1.8. The FAA should work with the aviation community to develop and protect the integrity of standard safety databases that can be shared in accident prevention programs. The identification of deviations from normal operations, adverse trends, and other incidents can be a valuable tool in preventing accidents. The most effective way to identify incidents and problems in aviation is for the people who operate in the system (pilots, mechanics, controllers, dispatchers, etc.) to self-disclose the information. There are a number of separate safety data collection efforts ongoing within government and industry. Many of these efforts - 13 -   either duplicate existing data, report the same information, or are not interconnected or integrated. The FAA should work with the aviation community to develop standard databases of safety information that can be shared openly and encompass operations within the aviation industry as well as those within the FAA, such as air traffic control. People and companies will not provide or assemble safety data or information if the information will disclose trade secrets, if it can threaten a person's job or be used in an enforcement action against a person or company, or if it can in any way cause them a liability. Data protection is the key to self-disclosure. The Flight Safety Foundation has studied this issue and concluded that legislation is the only way to guarantee protection of safety data. The joint industry/DOT Aviation Safety Plan cites data protection as a key to achieving Zero Accidents. The Congress, at the request of the Administration, recently enacted legislation providing for the protection from public disclosure of certain safety and security data voluntarily provided to the FAA. The FAA needs to expeditiously complete its rulemaking to implement this legislation. Since adequate legislative protection is key to building the trust necessary for self disclosure and safety monitoring, the FAA should assess the adequacy of the new legislative authority and implementing regulations one year after the regulations take effect. Any necessary regulatory or legislative modifications identified at that time should be promptly addressed.  1.9. In cooperation with airlines and manufacturers, the FAA's Aging Aircraft program should be expanded to cover non-structural systems. The average age of commercial airline fleets is continuing to increase. In 1975, few large commercial aircraft were in service beyond their original design life, typically twenty years. But with increased competition and growth in passenger and cargo traffic brought on by deregulation, service lives of dependable aircraft models were extended through expanded maintenance and overhaul programs. By the year 2000, more than 2,500 commercial aircraft in the United States may be flying beyond their original design life.11 In 1988, a Boeing 737 in Hawaii suffered severe structural failure of its forward fuselage sections due to corrosion not visible during normal maintenance inspections. As a direct result of this accident, the FAA greatly expanded its structural integrity inspection program and formed the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group (AAWG). Its focus has been almost exclusively on structural integrity, and the effects of structural corrosion and fatigue. The programs in existence under the AAWG have been effective and are considered adequate to deal proactively with the structural problems associated with aging commercial aircraft. However, much less is known about the potential effects of age on non-structural components of commercial aircraft. Non-structural components include electrical wiring; connectors, wiring harnesses, and cables; fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic lines; and electro-mechanical systems such as pumps, sensors, and actuators. Neither the manufacturers nor the commercial airlines consider the aging of non-structural components to pose serious safety problems - 14 -   primarily because they consider their redundancy, replacement upon failure, and periodic, programmed maintenance to be sufficient to assure aircraft safety. The Commission is concerned that existing procedures, directives, quality assurance, and inspections may not be sufficient to prevent safety related problems caused by the corrosive and deteriorating effects of non-structural components of commercial aircraft as they age. To address this, the Commission recommends that the FAA work with airlines and manufacturers to expand the aging aircraft program to include non-structural components, through steps including: full and complete tear-downs of selected aircraft scheduled to go out of service; the establishment of a lead-the-fleet research program; an expansion of the FAA-DoD-NASA cooperative aging aircraft program; an expansion of programs of the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group to include non-structural components; and encouraging the development of modern technical means to ensure and predict the continued airworthiness of aging nonstructural components and systems.  1.10. The FAA should develop better quantitative models and analytic techniques to inform management decision-making. The FAA is called upon to evaluate many proposals for safety and security improvements and capacity enhancements as part of its NAS modernization, and other programs. The FAA does not have a developed model for the air traffic control system that permits the systematic evaluation and comparison of these proposals with respect to their life-cycle cost and their likely effects on the operation of the air traffic control system. If available, such analysis would be of great assistance to support decision-making by the FAA and the DOT leadership. The Commission urges the FAA to strengthen its analytic and planning tools, especially through the development of models that give insight into the system-wide consequences of alternative courses of action and the development of a credible cost accounting system, as mandated in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996.  1.11. The DOT should work with the Department of Justice to ensure that airline crew members performing their duties are protected from passenger misconduct. Passenger behavior that amounts to criminal conduct is a matter of growing concern to U.S. airlines. When crew members are called upon to enforce in-flight safety and security rules and regulations, they are working to ensure that our aviation system remains safe and secure. Their responsibilities at times require them to confront passengers who are unwilling to comply with lawful instructions and become abusive. Such conduct by passengers threatens the well-being of all those on the plane, and is subject to federal prosecution. The Commission urges the DOT to work with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorneys to ensure that priority is given the prosecution of offending passengers to the fullest extent of the law for interfering with airline crew members in the performance of their duties. - 15 -   1.12. Legislation should be enacted to protect aviation industry employees who report safety or security violations. In a number of important industries, statutory protection is provided to ""whistleblowers"" who report violations of safety procedures. The Commission believes that aviation safety and security will be enhanced if employees, who are a critical link in safety and security, are able to report unsafe conditions to the FAA without fear of retribution from their employers. Some aviation employees are provided protections through contractual agreements. However, the Commission believes that statutory protection, such as that provided to workers under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, would provide uniformity within the industry and provide coverage to those not already protected.  1.13. The FAA should eliminate the exemptions in the Federal Aviation Regulations that allow passengers under the age of two to travel without the benefit of FAAapproved restraints. Current regulations require that all passengers over the age of two have their own seats, and that those seats are equipped with FAA-approved restraints. The Commission believes that it is inappropriate for infants to be afforded a lesser degree of protection than older passengers. The FAA should revise its regulations to require that all occupants be restrained during takeoff, landing, and turbulent conditions, and that all infants and small children below the weight of 40 pounds and under the height of 40 inches be restrained in an appropriate child restraint system, such as child safety seats, appropriate to their height and weight. The Commission also notes and commends the FAA's ongoing efforts in collaboration with major airframe and seat manufacturers to develop standards for integrated child safety seats.  - 16 -   1.14. The Commission commends the joint government-industry initiative to equip the cargo holds of all passenger aircraft with smoke detectors, and urges expeditious implementation of the rules and other steps necessary to achieve the goal of both detection and suppression in all cargo holds. In December 1996, most of the nation's major airlines announced a voluntary action to install smoke detection systems in the cargo holds of commercial airplanes and to study additional measures for fire suppression. This announcement broke a deadlock that had existed for most of the last decade. The Commission commends this initiative as an example of the partnership that will be necessary to enhance safety and security.  - 17 -   Chapter Two: Making Air Traffic Control Safer and More Efficient ""While the airlines are posting record traffic figures and profits, the ground-based air traffic control infrastructure is outdated and unable to keep pace with expansion."" Association 12  Barry Krasner, President of the National Air Traffic Controllers  It is essential that the air traffic system of the United States be modernized. Although the current system remains safe, it is showing signs of aging. System outages, brownouts, inefficiencies in air traffic control, and capacity limitations on the ground add costs to the FAA and to users of the airspace system. The Air Transport Association estimates that inefficiencies in the system cost airlines in excess of $3 billion in 1995 -- costs ultimately paid by passengers and anyone who purchases goods shipped by air. In 1996, a government-industry task force defined a future operational concept known as Free Flight13. Under this concept, national airspace system (NAS) operations will transition from ground-based air traffic control (using analog radios, navigational beacons and radar) to more collaborative air traffic management based on digital communication, satellite navigation, and computer-aided decision support tools for controllers and pilots. This proposed new system offers significant benefits for users of the NAS, for the safety and convenience of the traveling public, and for greater FAA operational efficiency. The FAA's proposed technical approach and schedule for NAS modernization are documented in its recently published National Airspace System Architecture. The proposed NAS architecture is generally consistent with industry's vision for the future of air traffic management, but the proposed schedule for modernization is too slow to meet projected demands and funding issues are not adequately addressed. Unless the schedule is accelerated, the United States may lose its position of global leadership in civil aviation. The technology needed to modernize the ATC system by and large exists, and is available off-the-shelf. The challenge is completing the transition to the new system in a timely and cost-effective manner, and ensuring that all users participate in the upgrade. Unfortunately, the FAA has encountered serious problems in its modernization program. Before major changes were made in 1994, the centerpiece of the FAA's modernization program had, according to the General Accounting Office, fallen eight years behind schedule,  - 18 -   and was $5 billion over budget. Cost overruns in five other key programs ranged from 50 to more than 500%, and delays averaged close to four years.14 Major Shutdowns of Air Traffic Control Facilities Affecting 100 or more flights, 1995-1996 15 Location New York Oakland Chicago Ft. Worth Ft. Worth New York Chicago Ft. Worth New York Chicago Jacksonville Seattle Flights Delayed 485 333 313 263 238 238 234 224 189 161 138 135 Duration of shutdown (hr:min) 5:49 0:34 0:46 14:35 3:49 0:37 1:05 2:17 0:36 0:44 1:44 2:02  These problems have been traced to inadequate user input, poor management and contractor performance, and inadequate oversight. Although availability of funds does not appear to have been a problem in the past, the capital needs of the future could well outstrip the ability to fund them through the traditional budget process, particularly as capital improvements are accelerated, as recommended by the Commission. Traditionally, the FAA has seen it necessary to design, own and operate its air traffic control system, in cooperation with the Department of Defense. Current off-the-shelf technology allows the FAA to consider its needs differently, particularly in areas such as the acquisition of communications systems. In other critical areas of government, including Defense, the private sector has proved its ability to provide critical services with increased quality and lower costs. A number of major U.S. manufacturers are producing new ATC systems for deployment in other countries. The FAA should seek collaborative opportunities with the private sector in order to accelerate the transition to a new NAS.  - 19 -   There have been several important changes that should allow the modernization program to move forward more effectively. The Commission notes, in particular, the following factors which should help avoid problems of the past: the redefinition of the modernization program; the personnel and procurement reforms granted the FAA, which give it unprecedented ability to hold managers accountable for results and to streamline procurement processes; and the creation of the new Management Advisory Committee by the Congress, which will give users a more effective voice in decision-making. However, the Commission believes that a new long-term financing mechanism is also necessary to ensure that modernization occurs on an acceptable schedule, and that the resulting safety and efficiency benefits are realized faster. The FAA must take advantage of personnel, procurement, and other reforms to ensure that it is spending existing resources more effectively in order to gain approval of innovative funding proposals from the Administration and the Congress. Additionally, the Commission believes that it is critical that the senior management at the DOT and the FAA take additional steps to ensure that past problems are being dealt with, and that an accelerated modernization schedule can proceed.  - 20 -   Recommendations 2.1. The FAA should develop a revised NAS modernization plan within six months that will set a goal of the modernized system being fully operational nationwide by the year 2005; and the Congress, the Administration, and users should develop innovative means of financing this acceleration. Modernization of our aging airspace system is critical to the safety of the traveling public, to maintaining our world leadership in aviation, and to our economic interests. The FAA's current plan calls for the modernized system to be operational after 2012. That is simply too long to postpone the safety and economic benefits that will derive from the modernized system. Therefore, the Commission recommends that 2005 be set as the date when all elements of the communication, navigation, and surveillance and air traffic management capabilities defined in the NAS architecture should be fully operational. This accelerated implementation must be coordinated with the Department of Defense, which is a major user and provider of air traffic control services. Implementation of the initiative announced by Vice President Gore on January 15, 1997 to demonstrate these systems in Hawaii and Alaska is an important step toward full operational status. Achieving this goal depends on the availability of several tools, as discussed in the following recommendations. Chief among these tools is the need to find non-traditional means of financing the capital improvements. Innovative approaches to federal financing of major infrastructure projects have been proposed in the past, including leveraging the revenues coming into the FAA, multi-year appropriations and non-traditional budget scoring. Nonfederal financing approaches have also been proposed, such as the creation of private infrastructure banks. The Commission expects that the National Civil Aviation Review Commission (NCARC), established in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 by Congress to explore funding options for the FAA, will consider these options. Whatever the funding mechanism selected, the Commission believes it is critical to our global leadership in civil aviation to finance an accelerated modernization of the NAS.  2.2. The FAA should develop plans to ensure that operational and airport capacity needs are integrated into the modernization of the NAS. The FAA's current NAS modernization program focuses on equipment and infrastructure. However, there is no clear plan for how the people who operate the system will make the transition, and what their roles and responsibilities will be under the new systems. The FAA should develop immediately a NAS Operational Plan to address these issues.  - 21 -   The FAA should also develop a National Airport System Modernization Plan that presents a strategic vision, plan and schedule for modernization of U.S. airports that is consistent with modernization of the NAS. This plan, produced in collaboration with local airport officials, should identify critical system capacity enhancement needs and should address major safety issues at airports. These plans, when incorporated into the revised NAS implementation plan called for in recommendation 2.1, would provide a balanced strategic plan for aviation in the United States.  2.3. The FAA should explore innovative means to accelerate the installation of advanced avionics in general aviation aircraft. The safety and efficiency benefits of the modernized NAS will not be realized fully until all users have incorporated its features. Delays in the installation of the equipment needed to operate in the future NAS will put off the benefits for all system users. Therefore, it is essential that the FAA, as it accelerates its modernization, works with users to ensure that they keep pace. Savings from more efficient operations provide significant incentive for commercial carriers to install the required digital radios, GPS receivers, and automatic dependent surveillance equipment. But it is essential to find ways to ensure general aviation users are equipped for future NAS operations.  2.4. The U.S. government should ensure the accuracy, availability and reliability of the GPS system to accelerate its use in NAS modernization and to encourage its acceptance as an international standard for aviation. Satellite-based navigation and positioning is a core element of our NAS modernization plans, and is critical to achieving a seamless, efficient global aviation system in the future. The U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), which is a dual civil-military system operated by the U.S. Air Force, is the current and foreseeable backbone for any global navigation satellite system. Full acceptance of GPS as an international standard for aviation is dependent on greater assurance to the user community -- both foreign and domestic -- of its accuracy, availability and reliability. As part of its NAS modernization plans, the FAA is currently developing a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) that will enhance the basic GPS civil service to meet the requirements of civil aviation users. Many other nations, including Europe and Japan, are planning similar augmentations, but are still somewhat reluctant to base their own airspace management on a GPS system which they perceive to be controlled by the U.S. military. The recent U.S. GPS policy made considerable progress in addressing these international concerns by assuring the continued availability of basic civil GPS services worldwide, free of direct user fees. This new policy also established a joint civil-military Executive Board to manage GPS and its augmentations, and initiated formal international discussions aimed at developing agreements on the provision and use of GPS services. But, there are still a - 22 -   number of important technical and policy issues that must be resolved if GPS is to become the system of choice for global aviation navigation and positioning. First, the U.S. must provide stronger strategic leadership for civil users of GPS . The acceptance of GPS as an international standard is key to continued U.S. leadership in aviation, and can only be achieved through strong civilian participation in GPS planning and decisionmaking. A number of working groups and advisory committees currently exist throughout the Federal government and the private sector to coordinate and represent the needs of civil users of GPS. The Commission recommends that civilian leadership be strengthened by establishing a Civil GPS Users Advisory Council, with representatives from both the users and providers of GPS equipment and services, reporting to the GPS Executive Board. The Commission also encourages the Administration to work rapidly on the development of international guidelines on the provision and use of GPS services called for in the President's recent GPS policy directive. Second, greater redundancy is needed to enhance the ability of users to cross-check GPS accuracy and to verify the system's reliability . The most effective means of achieving this redundancy is to provide additional civil GPS precision ranging signals in space. Studies have shown that additional precision ranging capability can be achieved at relatively little cost while providing enormous benefits to all civil GPS users. The Commission recommends that this capability be added to the FAA's WAAS system. This action will result in a more robust and inherently more reliable system and will provide a major boost to the international acceptance of GPS as a standard for aviation navigation and positioning. Third, the GPS Executive Board should resolve the remaining issues over funding and frequency assignment for a second civil frequency as quickly as possible so that this needed improvement can be included in the next generation of GPS satellites . The GPS Executive Board is considering enhancements to future GPS satellites that would include an additional broadcast frequency. This additional frequency would expand the base of civil GPS users worldwide and would send a strong message to the international community that the U.S. intends to maintain a long-term commitment to providing civil GPS services. Moreover, the FAA's WAAS system requires two frequencies to meet the accuracy needs of civil aviation users, and the additional frequency would allow for complete independence of civil and military GPS services in the future. Fourth, the GPS system must be protected from both intentional and unintentional interference . The GPS system will be a core, safety-critical component of the future global aviation information system. The security of GPS should be a major consideration in carrying out Recommendation 3.6 for protecting all aviation information systems.  - 23 -   2.5. The users of the NAS should fund its development and operation. The current system of funding the ATC system provides little direct connection between the excise taxes paid and services provided or the amount made available to the FAA through the budget and appropriations process. Replacing the traditional system of excise taxes with user fees offers the potential to correlate revenues and spending more closely.* Importantly, a financing system would not only help ensure adequate availability of funding , but would also build incentives for efficiency and safety into the system -- both for the users and for the FAA. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission is the proper venue for resolving the details of a new user fee system, and the Commission expects that it will be formed and begin its work in the very near future. The Commission urges the NCARC, in designing a new financing system, to ensure that any changes in the relative amount of revenues generated from any segment of the aviation industry do not result in undue economic disruption within any segment of the industry, and that the fees are not discriminatory or anti-competitive among carriers. In addition, non-business general aviation users of the NAS should not be adversely impacted by any new financing system. This will help ensure that general aviation users will be full and willing participants in the modernized NAS. * Mr. Coleman takes no position with respect to the first two sentences of recommendation 2.5 as he feels this is among the issues NCARC is to resolve.  2.6. The FAA should identify and justify by July 1997 the frequency spectrum necessary for the transition to a modernized air traffic control system. Expansion of telecommunications and other industries is creating greater competition for frequency spectrum. The FAA has indicated a need to retain large segments of its current spectrum allocation, but has provided insufficient justification for doing so. To ensure that the FAA's spectrum needs during modernization are not compromised the Commission recommends that the FAA complete a full justification, as well as a plan for freeing up spectrum as older systems are modernized or decommissioned. This process must be completed not later than July, 1997, and the results included by the DOT in the Federal Radio Navigation Plan and the RTCA 185 Report: Aeronautical Spectrum Planning for the Years 1997-2010.  - 24 -   Chapter Three: Improving Security for Travelers ""We know we can't make the world risk-free, but we can reduce the risks we face and we have to take the fight to the terrorists. If we have the will, we can find the means."" President Clinton  16  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence sources have been warning that the threat of terrorism is changing in two important ways. First, it is no longer just an overseas threat from foreign terrorists. People and places in the United States have joined the list of targets, and Americans have joined the ranks of terrorists. The bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Federal Building in Oklahoma City are clear examples of the shift, as is the conviction of Ramzi Yousef for attempting to bomb twelve American airliners out of the sky over the Pacific Ocean. The second change is that in addition to well-known, established terrorist groups, it is becoming more common to find terrorists working alone or in ad-hoc groups, some of whom are not afraid to die in carrying out their designs. Although the threat of terrorism is increasing, the danger of an individual becoming a victim of a terrorist attack -- let alone an aircraft bombing -- will doubtless remain very small. But terrorism isn't merely a matter of statistics. We fear a plane crash far more than we fear something like a car accident. One might survive a car accident, but there's no chance in a plane at 30,000 feet. This fear is one of the reasons that terrorists see airplanes as attractive targets. And, they know that airlines are often seen as national symbols. When terrorists attack an American airliner, they are attacking the United States. They have so little respect for our values -- so little regard for human life or the principles of justice that are the foundation of American society -- that they would destroy innocent children and devoted mothers and fathers completely at random. This cannot be tolerated, or allowed to intimidate free societies. There must be a concerted national will to fight terrorism. There must be a willingness to apply sustained economic, political and commercial pressure on countries sponsoring terrorists. There must be an unwavering commitment to pursuing terrorists and bringing them to justice. There must be the resolve to punish those who would violate sanctions imposed against terrorist states. Today's aviation security is based in part on the defenses erected in the 1970s against hijackers and on recommendations made by the Commission on Aviation Security and - 25 -   Terrorism, which was formed in the wake of the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Improvements in aviation security have been complicated because government and industry often found themselves at odds, unable to resolve disputes over financing, effectiveness, technology, and potential impacts on operations and passengers. Americans should not have to choose between enhanced security and efficient and affordable air travel. Both goals are achievable if the federal government, airlines, airports, aviation employees, local law enforcement agencies, and passengers work together to achieve them. Accordingly, the Commission recommends a new partnership that will marshal resources more effectively, and focus all parties on achieving the ultimate goal: enhancing the security of air travel for Americans. The Commission considered the question of whether or not the FAA is the appropriate government agency to have the primary responsibility for regulating aviation security. The Commission believes that, because of its extensive interactions with airlines and airports, the FAA is the appropriate agency, with the following qualifications: first, that the FAA must improve the way it carries out its mission; and second, that the roles of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in supporting the FAA must be more clearly defined and coordinated. The Commission's recommendations address those conditions. The terrorist threat is changing and growing. Therefore, it is important to improve security not just against familiar threats, such as explosives in checked baggage, but also to explore means of assessing and countering emerging threats, such as the use of biological or chemical agents, or the use of missiles. While these do not present significant threats at present, it would be short-sighted not to plan for their possible use and take prudent steps to counter them. The Commission believes that aviation security should be a system of systems, layered, integrated, and working together to produce the highest possible levels of protection. Each of the Commission's recommendations should be looked upon as a part of a whole, and not in isolation. It should be noted that a number of the Commission's recommendations outlined in the previous chapter, particularly those relating to certification and regulation, apply to the FAA's security programs, as well.  - 26 -   Recommendations 3.1. The federal government should consider aviation security as a national security issue, and provide substantial funding for capital improvements. The Commission believes that terrorist attacks on civil aviation are directed at the United States, and that there should be an ongoing federal commitment to reducing the threats that they pose. In its initial report, the Commission called for approximately $160 million in federal funds for capital costs associated with improving security, and Congress agreed. As part of its ongoing commitment, the federal government should devote significant resources, of approximately $100 million annually, to meet capital requirements identified by airport consortia and the FAA. The Commission recognizes that more is needed. The Commission expects the National Civil Aviation Review Commission to consider a variety of options for additional user fees that could be used to pay for security measures including, among others, an aviation user security surcharge, the imposition of local security fees, tax incentives and other means.  3.2. The FAA should establish federally mandated standards for security enhancements. These enhancements should include standards for use of Explosive Detection System (EDS) machines, training programs for security personnel, use of automated bag match technology, development of profiling programs (manual and automated), and deployment of explosive detection canine teams.  3.3. The Postal Service should advise customers that all packages weighing over 16 ounces will be subject to examination for explosives and other threat objects in order to move by air. The Postal Service now requires that packages weighing over 16 ounces must be brought to a post office, rather than be placed in a mailbox. To improve security further, the Postal Service should mandate that all mail weighing over 16 ounces contain a written release that allows it to be examined by explosive detection systems in order to be shipped by air. The Postal Service should develop and implement procedures to randomly screen such packages for explosives and other threat objects. If necessary, the Postal Service should seek appropriate legislation to accomplish this.  - 27 -   3.4. Current law should be amended to clarify the U.S. Customs Service's authority to search outbound international mail. Currently, the Customs Service searches for explosives and other threat objects on inbound mail and cargo. This recommended legislative enhancement parallels the Customs Service's existing border search authority.  3.5. The FAA should implement a comprehensive plan to address the threat of explosives and other threat objects in cargo and work with industry to develop new initiatives in this area. The FAA should place greater emphasis on the work of teams, such as the Aviation Security Advisory Committee and the Baseline Cargo Working Group, to address cargo issues. The Commission believes that the FAA should implement the Baseline Group's recommendation with regard to profiling by ""known"" and ""unknown"" shippers. In addition, unaccompanied express shipments on commercial passenger aircraft should be subject to examination by explosives detection systems; the FAA should work with industry to develop a computer assisted cargo profiling system that can be integrated into airlines' and forwarders' reservation and operating systems; requirements should be implemented requiring that trucks delivering cargo for loading on planes be sealed and locked; the FAA should develop and distribute air cargo security training materials; and enhanced forwarder and shipper employee screening procedures should be developed.  3.6. The FAA should establish a security system that will provide a high level of protection for all aviation information systems. In addition to improving the physical security of the traveling public, information systems critical to aircraft, air traffic control and airports should also be protected. Although government is responsible for a great number of aviation related information systems, a partnership must be formed in order to create integrated protection among these and related private sector systems. Some protective measures will become the responsibility of airlines, some that of the airports and others of the aircraft and air traffic control systems manufacturers and maintenance providers. The National Security Agency must play a role in coordinating information security measures, setting standards and providing oversight of system security to ensure protection against outside interference, disruption and corruption. Specific legislation should be reviewed that makes willful interference with information systems a federal crime with substantial penalties to provide a clear deterrent.  - 28 -   3.7. The FAA should work with airlines and airport consortia to ensure that all passengers are positively identified and subjected to security procedures before they board aircraft. Curb-side check-in, electronic ticketing, advance boarding passes, and other initiatives are affecting the way passengers enter the air transportation system. As improved security procedures are put into place, it is essential that all passengers be accounted for in that system, properly identified and subject to the same level of scrutiny. The Commission urges the FAA to work with airlines and airport consortia to ensure that necessary changes are made to accomplish that goal.  3.8. Submit a proposed resolution, through the U.S. Representative, that the International Civil Aviation Organization begin a program to verify and improve compliance with international security standards. Although 185 nations have ratified the International Civil Aviation Organization convention, and the security standards contained in it, compliance is not uniform. This creates the potential for security vulnerabilities on connecting flights throughout the world. To help raise levels of security throughout the world, the International Civil Aviation Organization needs greater authority to determine whether nations are in compliance. Strong U.S. sponsorship for adding verification and compliance capabilities to the International Civil Aviation Organization could lead to enhanced worldwide aviation security.  3.9. Assess the possible use of chemical and biological weapons as tools of terrorism. FAA should work with the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy on programs to anticipate and plan for changing threats, such as chemical and biological agents.  3.10. The FAA should work with industry to develop a national program to increase the professionalism of the aviation security workforce, including screening personnel. The Commission believes it's critical to ensure that those charged with providing security for over 500 million passengers a year in the United States are the best qualified and trained in the industry. One proposal that could accomplish this goal is the creation of a nationwide non-profit security corporation, funded by the airlines, to handle airport security. This concept, under consideration by the major airlines, merits further review. The Commission recommends that the FAA work with the private sector and other federal agencies to promote the professionalism of security personnel through a program that could include: licensing and performance standards that reflect best practices; adequate, common - 29 -   and recurrent training that considers human factors; emphasis on reducing turnover rates; rewards for performance; opportunities for advancement; a national rank and grade structure to permit employees to find opportunities in other areas; regional and national competitions to identify highly skilled teams; and, an agreement among users to hire based on performance, not just cost.  3.11 Access to airport controlled areas must be secured and the physical security of aircraft must be ensured. Air carriers and airport authorities, working with FAA, must develop comprehensive and effective means by which to secure aircraft and other controlled areas from unauthorized access and intrusion. Use of radio frequency transponders to track the location of people and objects in airport controlled areas, including aircraft, offers significant advantages over the current security measures commonly used today. Where adequate airport controlled area and aircraft security are not assured by other means, this technology should be considered for use at both international and domestic airports.  - 30 -   The Following Recommendations Were Presented to President Clinton on September 9, 1996 3.12. Establish consortia at all commercial airports to implement enhancements to aviation safety and security. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 1. Establish consortia at all commercial airports to implement enhancements to aviation safety and security. The Commission is convinced that safety, security, efficiency, and affordability can go hand in hand if all parties work as partners. The FAA should direct its officials responsible for oversight of security procedures at the nation's 450 commercial airports to convene relevant aviation and law enforcement entities for the purpose of implementing the Commission's recommendations and further improving aviation safety and security. At each airport, these partners will: (1) immediately conduct a vulnerability assessment; and (2) based on that assessment, develop an action plan that includes the deployment of new technology and processes to enhance aviation safety and security. The FAA will approve these action plans on an expedited basis; procure and allocate, based on availability, new equipment; and test airports to ensure that the plans are being implemented properly.  Status Forty-one major airport consortia have submitted action plans for FAA review. The Commission's most important recommendation in its initial report was that local consortia be convened to identify vulnerabilities and propose action plans. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) called for initial consortia meetings by September 27, 1996, at 41 major U.S. airports where FAA personnel are permanently deployed. By December 2, 1996, all consortia action plans or reports from these airports had been presented to the FAA for review. The consortia action plans defined local security threat conditions based on input from FAA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Consortia also assessed other areas such as personnel training, passenger screening, access control measures, and equipment and technology needs.  Augmenting Recommendation The FAA should formalize the establishment of consortia at all Category X through Category III airports by September 30, 1997, and, after consultation with industry, issue guidance on the future of consortia.  - 31 -   3.13. Conduct airport vulnerability assessments and develop action plans. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 2. Conduct airport vulnerability assessments and develop action plans . Using models already developed by Sandia National Laboratory, periodic vulnerability assessments of the nation's commercial airports should be conducted. Based on the results, action plans tailored to each airport will be developed for expedited approval by the FAA.  Status Law enforcement agencies are conducting assessments and addressing problems. The FAA Authorization Act of 1996 required the FAA and FBI to conduct joint threat and vulnerability assessments on security every three years, or more frequently if necessary, at each airport determined to be high risk. In November 1996, officials from the FBI, FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT) established a working group to define ""high risk"" airports. Discussions have been held on the criteria to be used to identify an airport facility as high risk, methodology to use in conducting joint FAA/FBI vulnerability assessments, and which airports should be assessed on a priority basis. The target date for completing the procedures for conducting vulnerability assessments is April 30, 1997, and initial assessments are to begin by late June, 1997.  3.14. Require criminal background checks and FBI fingerprint checks for all screeners, and all airport and airline employees with access to secure areas. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 3. Require criminal background checks and FBI fingerprint checks for all screeners, and all airport and airline employees with access to secure areas. Currently, employees, including those with unescorted access to secure areas of airports, are not subject to such review. Given the risks associated with the potential introduction of explosives into these areas, the Commission recommends that screeners and employees with access to secure areas be subject to criminal background checks and FBI fingerprint checks.  Status The FBI has reduced fingerprint check turnaround time to at most seven days. The FBI has expedited the processing of aviation related fingerprint submissions. The FBI will accelerate its efforts to make software modifications and purchase additional computer hardware to adapt its  - 32 -   Electronic Fingerprinting Image Print Server (EFIPS) system to accept civil fingerprint cards.  Augmenting Recommendation The Commission reiterates that the overall goal is FBI fingerprint checks of all airport and airline employees with access to secure areas, no later than mid-1999.  3.15 Deploy existing technology. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 4. Deploy existing technology. The Commission has reviewed numerous machines designed to detect explosives in cargo, checked baggage, carry-on bags, and on passengers. There is no silver bullet. No single machine offers a solution to the challenges we face. Each machine has its own advantages and its own limitations. Even machines that work fairly well in the laboratory need to be tested in actual use at busy airports. We recognize that the FAA has certified only one technology for baggage screening, but we believe we must get a variety of machines, including some in use in other countries, into the field. There day-to-day operators can figure out which equipment works best in what situations and combinations, and what features need to be improved. Finding the strengths and weakness of existing technology will spur industry's creativity, leading to the invention of better and better instruments. Ultimately, the goal should be to deploy equipment that can be certified by the FAA to detect explosives likely to be used by terrorists. The Commission recommends the government purchase significant numbers of computed tomography detection systems, upgraded x-rays, and other innovative systems. By deploying equipment widely, passengers throughout the aviation system will receive the benefits of the enhancements. The Commission strongly believes it would be improper to discuss the details of such deployment, as to do so would serve only to compromise the integrity of an enhanced security system. The Commission recommends that this initial equipment purchase be paid for with appropriated funds. This recommendation does not settle the issue of how security costs will be financed in the long run. That will be dealt with in our final report.  Status Congress funded the purchase of commercially available advanced security screening equipment. The FAA has ordered 54 advanced explosives detection systems. In November and December 1996, FAA awarded six fixed priced contracts to various manufacturers of explosives trace detection technologies.  - 33 -   Augmenting Recommendation The Commission recognizes that deployed technology for examining carry-on baggage may be outdated. New developments such as computerized systems with high resolution digital displays, innovative use of color to highlight threat objects, and ability to accommodate technologies such as threat image projection to maintain screener performance, can provide enhanced security. The FAA should review available technology for screening carry on items, regularly update minimum standards for new installations, and develop programs for upgrading deployed technology.  Cross Reference to Related Recommendations This recommendation is related to recommendation 3.2.  3.16. Establish a joint government-industry research and development program. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 5. Establish a joint government-industry research and development program. The Commission recommends the establishment of a new joint government - industry partnership whose mission will be to accelerate research and development to enhance the security of air travel. This could be modeled on the Partnership For A New Generation Vehicle (PNGV), in which the federal government and auto makers are combining resources to develop automobiles with significantly enhanced fuel economy, safety, and reduced emissions. We propose to increase federal funding and to ask the private sector to contribute.  Status The FAA is working with industry to develop agreements and award research grants. Congress increased the federal funding of R&D as required. The FAA is moving in the direction of interacting more closely with industry, having set up advisory mechanisms such as the Aviation Security Advisory Committee; participating in individual Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with individual firms; giving grants to airlines and airports to conduct demonstrations and otherwise involve themselves in security technology development; entering into cost-sharing arrangements with firms to develop security technology.  - 34 -   Augmenting Recommendation The FAA received additional funding and has aggressively accelerated systems to (1) improve screener performance, (2) reduce aircraft vulnerability, (3) screen cargo, and (4) to develop options for dealing with threats other than explosives. The FAA is encouraged to use the best technology available to solve security and safety challenges throughout the air transportation system.  3.17. Establish an interagency task force to assess the potential use of surface-to-air missiles against commercial aircraft. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 7. Assess the viability of anti-missile defense systems. Whether or not the explosion of TWA 800 turns out to have been due to a surface-to-air missile attack, as some eye-witness accounts suggest, missile attacks have downed passenger planes in other countries, and it is a risk that should be evaluated. The Commission will continue to analyze this problem in cooperation with the Department of Defense and other government agencies.  Status DoD will convene an interagency task force to examine the threat to civil aircraft. Initial analyses of both the missile threat and electronic systems available to counter it support a decision to take positive steps. Experts from the Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community, defense contractors and research scientists contributed to analysis of the viability of anti-missile defense systems for civil aviation.  Augmenting Recommendation Within ninety days, the Department of Defense should convene an interagency task force including the DOT, the FAA and the intelligence community to address the potential threat from surface-to-air missiles against commercial aviation. Working with airport consortia, this task force should develop plans to provide increased surveillance, and, if necessary, the deployment of countermeasures. The task force should make recommendations to the DOT regarding the testing, evaluation and preparation for deployment of measures to protect civil aircraft against an increased threat from surface-to-air missiles. Appropriate steps should be taken by the intelligence community and through international diplomacy to reduce the possibility that terrorists could obtain or use surface-to-air missiles. The State Department should study the expansion of conventional arms agreements to include  - 35 -   man-portable surface-to-air missiles, and the U.S. Representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) should propose a new convention addressing these weapons.  3.18. Significantly expand the use of bomb-sniffing dogs. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 6. Significantly expand the use of bomb-sniffing dogs. Canines are used to detect explosives in many important areas, but only sparingly in airport security. The Commission is convinced that an increase in the number of well-trained dogs and handlers can make a significant and rapid improvement in security, and recommends the deployment of 114 additional teams.  Status The FAA received funding for 114 new dog teams and training has begun.  Augmenting Recommendation Additionally, the Commission recommends that ATF continue to work to develop government-wide standards for canine teams.  - 36 -   3.19. Complement technology with automated passenger profiling. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 8. Complement technology with automated passenger profiling Profiling can leverage an . investment in technology and trained people. Based on information that is already in computer databases, passengers could be separated into a very large majority who present little or no risk, and a small minority who merit additional attention. Such systems are employed successfully by other agencies, including the Customs Service. By utilizing this process Customs is better able to focus its resources and attention. As a result, many legitimate travelers never see a customs agent anymore -- and drug busts are way up. The FAA and Northwest Airlines are developing an automated profiling system tailored to aviation security, and the Commission supports the continued development and implementation of such a system. To improve and promote passenger profiling, the Commission recommends three steps. First, FBI, CIA, and ATF should evaluate and expand the research into known terrorists, hijackers, and bombers needed to develop the best possible profiling system. They should keep in mind that such a profile would be most useful to the airlines if it could be matched against automated passenger information which the airlines maintain. Second, the FBI and CIA should develop a system that would allow important intelligence information on known or suspected terrorists to be used in passenger profiling without compromising the integrity of the intelligence or its sources. Similar systems have been developed to give environmental scientists access to sensitive data collected by satellites. Third, the Commission will establish an advisory board on civil liberties questions that arise from the development and use of profiling systems.  Status Profiling systems are being developed. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Northwest Airlines are completing final programming changes to an automated profiling system. A tentative completion date for programming changes and implementation of Computer Assisted Passenger Screening (CAPS) on Northwest flights is April, 1997. Additional programming will begin for use of CAPS on other airline reservations systems, with a tentative completion date of August, 1997. On January 17, 1997, a Civil Liberties Advisory Board met with Commissioners to discuss civil liberties concerns pertaining to profiling. The Board submitted recommendations to the Commission. (Appendix A)  - 37 -   Augmenting Recommendation The Commission believes that profiling is one part of a comprehensive, layered security program. As with other measures, it becomes less necessary with the introduction of efficient screening technology. Based on readily-available information, passengers could be separated into a very large majority about whom we know enough to conclude that they present little or no risk, and a small minority about whom we do not know enough and who merit additional attention. The Customs Service uses this approach successfully to better focus its resources and attention. As a result, many legitimate travelers never see a customs agent anymore -and drug busts are way up. The Commission supports the development and implementation of manual and automated profiling systems, such as the one under development by the FAA and Northwest Airlines. The Commission strongly believes the civil liberties that are so fundamentally American should not, and need not, be compromised by a profiling system. Consistent with this viewpoint, the Commission sought the counsel of leading experts in the civil liberties field. Those experts provided a series of recommendations found in Appendix A. The Commission recommends the following safeguards: 1. No profile should contain or be based on material of a constitutionally suspect nature  e.g., race, religion, national origin of U.S. citizens. The Commission recommends that the elements of a profiling system be developed in consultation with the Department of Justice and other appropriate experts to ensure that selection is not impermissibly based on national origin, racial, ethnic, religious or gender characteristics. 2. Factors to be considered for elements of the profile should be based on measurable, verifiable data indicating that the factors chosen are reasonable predictors of risk, not stereotypes or generalizations. A relationship must be demonstrated between the factors chosen and the risk of illegal activity. 3. Passengers should be informed of airlines security procedures and of their right to avoid any search of their person or luggage by electing not to board the aircraft. 4. Searches arising from the use of an automated profiling system should be no more intrusive than search procedures that could be applied to all passengers. Procedures for searching the person or luggage of, or for questioning, a person who is selected by the automated profiling system should be premised on insuring respectful, non-stigmatizing, and efficient treatment of all passengers. 5. Neither the airlines nor the government should maintain permanent databases on selectees. Reasonable restrictions on the maintenance of records and strict limitations on the dissemination of records should be developed. 6. Periodic independent reviews of profiling procedures should be made. The Commission considered whether an independent panel be appointed to monitor implementation and recommends at a minimum that the DOJ, in consultation with the DOT and FAA, periodically review the profiling standards and create an outside panel should that, in their judgment, be necessary. - 38 -   7. The Commission reiterates that profiling should last only until Explosive Detection Systems are reliable and fully deployed. 8. The Commission urges that these elements be embodied in FAA standards that must be strictly observed.  3.20. Certify screening companies and improve screener performance. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 9. Certify screening companies and improve screener performance. Better selection, training, and testing of the people who work at airport x-ray machines would result in a significant boost in security. The Commission recommends development of uniform performance standards for the selection, training, certification, and recertification of screening companies and their employees. The Commission further recommends that in developing these standards, the FAA give serious consideration to implementing the National Research Council recommendations. The Commission also recommends the purchase and deployment of SPEARS, a computerized training and testing system.  Status The FAA has begun rulemaking procedures to require new certifications. The Federal Aviation Administration is developing an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) which will establish the requirement for screening companies to be certified in order to provide screening services to air carriers. The rule will include requirements to improve the training and testing of security screeners through development of uniform performance standards for providing security screening services. Congress gave FAA authority to certify screening companies, but did not provide FAA authority to certify individual screeners. This Commission urges Congress to provide that additional authority.  Augmenting Recommendation The Commission also recommends that the purchase and deployment of SPEARS, a computerized training and testing system, be completed at all major airports by the end of 1997.  - 39 -   3.21. Aggressively test existing security systems. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 10. Aggressively test existing security systems. ""Red team"" (adversary) type testing should also be increased by the FAA, and incorporated as a regular part of airport security action plans. Frequent, sophisticated attempts by these red teams to find ways to dodge security measures are an important part of finding weaknesses in the system and anticipating what sophisticated adversaries of our nation might attempt. An aggressive red team strategy will require significant increases in the number of FAA personnel currently assigned to these tasks.  Status The FAA is hiring 300 new special agents to test airport security.  3.22. Use the Customs Service to enhance security. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 11. Use the Customs Service to enhance security. The Customs Service has many responsibilities that are parallel to the FAA's in dealing with airlines and contraband. As a law enforcement agency, Customs has authorities and tools not available to the FAA. Further, it has developed successful partnership programs with the airlines. By using the Customs Service to complement the FAA, FBI, and other agencies, the Commission believes that aviation security would be significantly enhanced. The Customs Service has thousands of agents currently stationed at US international airports. Customs has statutory authority to search people and cargo to stop contraband from coming in or going out of the country. Customs has arrangements with most airlines to receive automated passenger and cargo manifests. These arrangements could be adapted for use in security procedures. Customs, as a law enforcement agency, has access to automated law enforcement databases that could be an invaluable tool in fighting not just drugs but terrorism. The Commission recommends that Customs upgrade and adapt its computer systems to take on this additional responsibility.  Status The Customs Service is deploying 140 inspectors and investigators to critical airports. The U.S. Customs Service is in the process of deploying 140 inspectors, intelligence analysts, and criminal investigators (special agents) to critical airports, for aviation security; anti-terrorism efforts, and to perform increased searches of passengers, baggage, and cargo departing the United States. Customs is  - 40 -   purchasing and deploying additional x-ray vans, tool trucks and radiation detector pagers at critical airports to assist in these searches. The Customs Service and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are working with an FAA contractor to study the technical issues associated with converting Customs' Automated Targeting System (ATS), which is designed for sea cargo analysis, to air cargo analysis. Although ATS is designed for contraband analysis and detection in the sea cargo environment, the plan would be to add anti-terrorism criteria to the system and convert it to an air cargo environment. The study should be completed in the Spring of 1997.  3.23. Give properly cleared airline and airport security personnel access to the classified information they need to know. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 12. Give properly cleared airline and airport security personnel access to the classified information they need to know. The red tape of classification is getting in the way of security. There are two problems that must be solved. The first involves intelligence information about specific terrorist threats. The CIA or FBI pass the threat information to the FAA, which in turn alerts the airlines. But the information gets progressively ""sanitized"" to avoid jeopardizing the source. Often, airlines are just told what to do but not why they are to do it. If airlines were provided more information about the threat, they could help design more effective responses. Corporate personnel are often cleared to know the most secret information when national security is at stake. Defense contractors with access to highly classified intelligence information are far from rare. For that matter, airline personnel were cleared to know highly classified information during Operation Desert Storm, when commercial aircraft transported 80% of our troops to Saudi Arabia. The other classified information problem involves the airport vulnerability assessments in recommendation number 2. These assessments become classified information if they conclude that a high degree of vulnerability exists. Some people responsible for security at the airports are not cleared to receive classified information. The Commission recommends that the FAA arrange for appropriate airline and airport security personnel to be cleared to address this problem.  Status The FAA is arranging for adequate clearance levels at airports and airlines. The FAA has agreed to collaborate more closely with airlines and airports in developing responses to threat information, and has agreed to disseminate vulnerability assessments to properly cleared officials.  - 41 -   3.24. Begin implementation of full bag-passenger match. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 13. Begin implementation of full bag-passenger match Matching bags to passengers ensures . that the baggage of anyone who does not board the plane is removed. Full bag match ensures that no unaccompanied bag remains on board a flight. Manual and automated systems to conduct full bag match have been employed in international aviation for several years, but need additional work to ensure they can be phased into domestic airline operations. The Commission recommends implementing full bag match at selected airports, including at least one hub, within sixty days to determine the best means of implementing the process system-wide.  Status The Commission remains committed to baggage match as a component of a comprehensive, layered security program aimed at keeping bombs and explosive devices off airlines. New technologies are available which facilitate positive and automated identification of the bag as it is tracked through the system. Automatic bag tracking systems can also facilitate the removal of bags from aircraft if required by security concerns. The Commission feels that these technologies can be combined with the development of a passenger manifest to implement a passenger-bag matching system as one component of a layered approach to aviation security. The Commission urges the industry and the FAA to work together to hasten the development of sophisticated technology for determining the presence of explosives in checked baggage. Until such machines are widely available, the Commission believes that bag match, initially based on profiling, should be implemented no later than December 31, 1997. The Commission's recommendation is consistent with that of the Baseline Working Group's recommendation in this contentious and difficult area. By that date, the bags of those selected either at random or through the use of automated profiling must either be screened or matched to a boarded passenger. No unaccompanied bag should be transported on a passenger aircraft unless (1) it has been screened by a screening method that meets the FAA standard, or (2) it belongs to a passenger who at the time of check in was neither randomly selected for security review nor selected by the profile for further review. This approach is the most effective methodology available now. It would allow the aviation industry to remove the unaccompanied bag or bags which represent the greatest threat.  - 42 -   3.25. Provide more compassionate and effective assistance to families of victims. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 14. Providing more compassionate and effective assistance to families of victims. The tragedy of losing a loved one in an aviation disaster can be unnecessarily and cruelly compounded by disjointed or incomplete information in the aftermath of the incident. At the Commission's urging, the President is directing the National Transportation Safety Board to take the lead in coordinating provision of services to families of victims. The NTSB will work with the Departments of State, Defense, Transportation, Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and private organizations like the Red Cross.  Status The NTSB was given responsibility to coordinate response. On October 9, 1996, Congress passed the Aviation Family Disaster Act of 1996 giving the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) the responsibility for aiding families of aircraft accident victims and coordinating the federal response to major domestic aviation accidents. Since the signing of the law, NTSB has completed the initial phase of coordinating the federal response to a major domestic aviation accident. The NTSB is in the process of finalizing existing interim Memoranda of Understanding with the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross (ARC). The NTSB has been vigorously assisting the airline industry to develop a model plan to address the needs of aviation disaster victims and their families. Letters from Chairman Jim Hall and DOT Secretary Federico Pea went out in November, 1996, to airlines informing them of their responsibility for producing an emergency response plan as specified in section 703 of the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996. An interim federal response has been developed by the NTSB that assigns responsibilities to the airlines and participating federal agencies. The ARC will be responsible for family care and mental health; the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be responsible for identification and preparation of human remains (with support by the Department of Defense, as needed); and the Department of State will assist the airlines and NTSB when foreign passengers are involved in an aviation accident. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide the NTSB with communications equipment and additional public affairs personnel. If the aviation disaster is officially determined to be a criminal act, the Department of Justice will provide information to families on entitlements and benefits under the Victims of Crime Act. Many elements of the interim NTSB plan were successfully implemented and tested following the United Express Flight 5925/5926 accident in Quincy, Illinois on November 19, 1996. The Department of Transportation and the NTSB have formed a task force to provide recommendations on the issues elaborated in section 704 of the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996. The task force includes officials from the NTSB, Federal Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross, airlines, family groups, and organizations considered appropriate by the Secretary of Transportation. Airlines are required by the Act to submit their plans to the Secretary of Transportation and to the Chairman of the NTSB by April 9, 1996.  - 43 -   Cross Reference to Related Recommendations This recommendation is related to recommendations 4.2 and 4.3.  3.26. Improve passenger manifests. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 15. Improve passenger manifests. The Commission believes that Section 203 of the 1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act, which requires airlines to keep a comprehensive passenger manifest for international flights, should be implemented as quickly as possible. While Section 203 does not apply to domestic flights, the Commission urges the Department of Transportation to explore immediately the costs and effects of a similar requirement on the domestic aviation system.  Status The DOT is proceeding with rulemaking to require international and domestic manifests. The DOT has developed a draft rule covering domestic flight manifesting, and an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), should be issued in early 1997. The DOT anticipates an extensive comment period for the ANPRM, because no data exist related to domestic flights. The final rule for domestic manifesting is likely to be published in 1998.  3.27. Significantly increase the number of FBI agents assigned to counterterrorism investigations, to improve intelligence, and to crisis response. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 16. Significantly increase the number of FBI agents assigned to counterterrorism investigations, to improve intelligence, and to crisis response The Commission recognizes the . vital role that the FBI plays in fighting terrorism against Americans, and recommends that the agency's ability to assess vulnerabilities, gather and analyze intelligence, and conduct forensic investigations be augmented.  - 44 -   Status Over 600 agents are being assigned to counterterrorism. This recommendation has been implemented. Based on the Administration's 1997 budget request, including a counterterrorism budget amendment, the Congress provided funding for 644 Special Agents, 620 support positions, and additional funding for counterterrorism investigations, intelligence gathering, forensics analysis, and crisis management.  3.28. Provide anti-terrorism assistance in the form of airport security training to countries where there are airports served by airlines flying to the US. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 17. Provide anti-terrorism assistance in the form of airport security training to countries where there are airports served by airlines flying to the US. The Commission believes that it is important to raise the level of security at all airports serving Americans. Assisting foreign countries through training in explosive detection, post-blast investigation, VIP protection, hostage negotiation, and incident management is an important means of achieving this goal.  Status The State Department and the FAA are sponsoring domestic and foreign courses. The Department of State and the FAA continue to jointly sponsor Anti-Terrorism Assistance Training Programs. In FY 1997, six domestic law enforcement classes and six international/foreign classes will be held.  3.29. Resolve outstanding issues relating to explosive taggants and require their use. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 18. Resolve outstanding issues relating to explosive taggants and require their use. The use of taggants can be a critical aid when investigating explosions on aircraft and in bringing terrorists to justice. The Commission recommends that remaining issues relating to the use of these taggants, including the analysis of black and smokeless powder, be resolved as quickly as possible, and that requirements for the use of taggants then be put into place.  - 45 -   Status Studies by the ATF have been initiated, with results expected in April, 1997. ATF has contracted with the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council to conduct an independent study. The International Fertilizer Development Center is under contract with ATF to conduct a study on the economic and agronomic effects of tagging ammonium nitrate fertilizer. A report is due to Congress on the study findings late in April, 1997.  3.30. Provide regular, comprehensive explosives detection training programs for foreign, federal, state, and local law enforcement, as well as FAA and airline personnel. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 19. Provide regular, comprehensive explosives detection training programs for foreign, federal, state, and local law enforcement, as well as FAA and airline personnel. The Commission believes that law enforcement agencies with expertise in explosives detection can provide valuable training to those involved in aviation security.  Status The ATF and FAA are preparing a training course for airport law enforcement agencies. The ATF is developing a curriculum on Improvised Explosive Devices. The pilot program is planned for Spring, 1997. In addition to ongoing explosives training for ATF personnel, three states and local Advanced Explosives Investigative Techniques classes are scheduled at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia. Finally, post blast and improvised explosive device recognition training will be conducted by 198 ATF certified explosive specialists for State and Local law enforcement personnel throughout the United States.  3.31. Create a central clearinghouse within government to provide information on explosives crime. Recommendation from Initial Report dated September 9, 1996 20. Create a central clearinghouse within government to provide information on explosives crime. The Commission recommends that a central clearinghouse be established to compile and distribute important information relating to previously encountered explosive devices, both foreign and domestic.  - 46 -   Status The Secretary of the Treasury has established a national repository at the ATF. The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to establish a national repository of information on incidents involving arson and the suspected criminal misuse of explosives. All Federal agencies having information concerning such incidents report the information to the Secretary. The ATF National Repository committee, has established a target date of October 1, 1997, for the implementation of the pilot project, with full implementation by the end of FY 1998. The system will be designed and constructed in incremental stages providing varying levels of service as early as April, 1997.  - 47 -   Initial Report Recommendation Updates from September 9, 1996 Report * 1.

I believe that by identifying areas in need of improvement, we can successfully generate a change in policy and action for the future. We will create a living memorial to their death.""  17 Aurlie Becker.  The Commission's recommendations included setting a goal of reducing the rate of fatal accidents by a factor of five over the next ten years, and outlined a course of action that would help achieve that goal. Additionally, the Commission has recommended specific steps to reduce the threat of terrorism against commercial aircraft. However, it must be recognized that, in spite of the strongest efforts of all involved, disasters may still occur. While government and industry must do everything possible to prevent them, they must also be prepared to respond quickly and compassionately when one does take place. The tragedy of losing a loved one in a plane crash can be cruelly and needlessly compounded by an uncoordinated, ineffective, or uninformed response to family members. The infrequency of commercial aviation accidents has complicated the response to such disasters. For example, when TWA Flight 800 crashed on July 17, 1996, it had been over twenty years since that airline's last fatal accident. Most crashes simply overwhelm state and local response teams, and take a tremendous toll on airline employees, who must immediately begin addressing the concerns of family members at the same time that they are coping with the loss of their own colleagues. Responding to the frustrations and complaints of family members over the treatment they received after accidents, President Clinton signed an executive memorandum giving the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) the responsibility for coordinating federal services to families after aviation disasters.18 Congress subsequently passed legislation further expanding and clarifying the NTSB's new responsibilities.19 Since its creation in 1967, the NTSB is the one entity that has been on the site of every transportation disaster. The Commission applauds the designation of the NTSB as the coordinating agency after aviation disasters, and commends the agency for its diligence in carrying out its new responsibilities.  - 49 -   Recommendations 4.1. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) should finalize by April, 1997, its coordinated federal response plan to aviation disasters, and Congress should provide the NTSB with increased funding to address its new responsibilities. The NTSB has developed an interim plan for a coordinated federal response to aviation disasters, which should be finalized as quickly as possible. That interim plan was put to the test in two recent disasters involving commuter aircraft, and resulted in clear improvements in service. The Commission commends the work of the NTSB and believes that only through a coordinated effort, and establishment of a standard protocol, can effective support be provided to local governments and airlines to meet the needs of family members. The Commission recommends that Congress provide such additional funds necessary to allow the NTSB to carry out the new responsibilities described in the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996.  4.2. The Department of Transportation should coordinate the development of plans for responding to aviation disasters involving civilians on government aircraft. The families of civilians killed while traveling on government aircraft face the same traumas and challenges as those whose loved ones were killed on commercial flights. However, the response to such disasters is covered under different laws and procedures. Those differences, and a clear statement regarding their rights and benefits in the event of an aviation disaster, should be provided to passengers on government aircraft prior to boarding. The Commission believes that it is essential that those families receive assistance comparable to that provided after commercial disasters through the enhanced role of the NTSB. The Commission urges the DOT to work with the NTSB, DoD, other agencies, and family members to develop plans to accomplish that goal by September 1997 and to evaluate the need to revise existing laws and regulations governing the rights and benefits of civilians on government aircraft.  4.3. The Department of Transportation and the NTSB should implement key provisions of the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 by March 31, 1997.  This Act authorized the formation of a task force to study the need for modifications to laws or regulations that would result in improvements to the treatment of family members of victims of aviation disasters. This task force will consider, among other things, issues relating to treatment of families by the media and legal community. Additionally, the Commission urges the task force to consider the development of uniform guidelines for notification, - 50 autopsies and DNA testing and other issues raised by family members, including rights and   treatment of foreign citizens and non-traditional families, securing crash sites, availability of cockpit voice recorder transcripts, and the composition of accident investigation teams. The Commission expects that establishment of the task force will be one of the first priorities for the new Secretary of Transportation, and that it will be accomplished without delay. In November 1996, the Chairman of the NTSB and the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) sent a joint letter to airlines to underscore the importance of this Act and to advise on the responsibilities of airlines to formulate disaster response plans. Those plans are due to the DOT and the NTSB by early April 1997. In addition, the NTSB should work with the State Department through Memoranda of Understanding or other mechanisms to provide direct services to the families of U.S. citizens who are victims of disasters on U.S. carriers abroad.  4.4. The United States Government should ensure that family members of victims of international aviation disasters receive just compensation and equitable treatment through the application of federal laws and international treaties. Certain statutes and international treaties, established over 50 years ago, historically have not provided equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. Specifically, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 (Act) and the Warsaw Convention of 1929 (Convention), although designed to aid families of victims of maritime and aviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family members of international aviation disasters from obtaining fair compensation. A recent agreement by U.S. airlines waived the liability of the Warsaw Convention. However, the Death on the High Seas Act still limits recoveries available after certain aviation disasters. Congress passed the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996 as a first step to remedy this situation. The Commission urges the Administration and the Congress to take additional steps necessary to ensure fairer and more equitable treatment of families of victims of international aviation disasters, including the establishment of an advisory board, pursuant to section 211 of the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, to develop a plan for equitable compensation of victims of aviation disasters.  - 51 -   4.5 Provisions should be made to ensure the availability of funding for extraordinary costs associated with accident response. The NTSB and other federal, state, and local government agencies can incur significant costs in the course of an accident response. Those costs cannot be anticipated nor budgeted for in advance, and their recovery has been made on an ad hoc basis, further complicating an already difficult situation. The Commission urges the Administration and Congress to address this issue, through the consideration of measures such as requirements for increased insurance coverage for companies involved in air transportation.  4.6. Federal agencies should establish peer support programs to assist rescue, investigative, law enforcement, counseling and other personnel involved in aviation disaster response. The men and women who respond on the scene of aviation disasters can suffer from considerable trauma and emotional impact. Specially trained peer support counselors, who are themselves investigators who have had similar experiences, should be dispatched to the scene of a disaster to help those involved in the response effort. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), because of its frequent investigations of arson and bombings, has developed such a program for its agents. The NTSB, the FAA, and other agencies should work with the ATF to develop programs for their personnel within existing budgets.  - 52 -   Conclusions The Commission believes that each of its recommendations is achievable. But, the Commission has no authority to implement its recommendations. That responsibility lies with government and industry. Many of the proposals will require additional funding. Some of them will require legislation. Each of them requires sustained attention. We now urge the President to make these recommendations his own. We urge Congress to provide the necessary legislation and funding. We urge the incoming leadership of the DOT and the FAA to make fulfillment of these recommendations a cornerstone of their work. We urge the commercial aviation industry to take up the technical and organizational challenges. We urge the thousands of private pilots across the nation to convert their enthusiasm for flying into a commitment make the changes necessary to enhance safety for everyone flying. And, we urge the American people to demand that this country take the steps now to do what is needed. By virtually any measure, the aviation system in the United States is the best in the world. But, every system can be improved; made safer, more secure, and more efficient. Every crash is a stark reminder of that reality. The world is changing, and so, too, must our aviation policies and practices. They should challenge everyone involved in aviation to improve. They should serve as the model for the rest of the world, and lead to improvements that will make passengers safer, regardless of where they board their flight. There are few areas in which the public so uniformly believes that government should play a strong role as in aviation safety and security. Aviation is an area over which the average person can exert little control; therefore, it becomes government's responsibility to work with industry to make sure that Americans enjoy the highest levels of safety and security when flying. Problems in these areas contribute to an erosion of public faith in aviation, and in government itself. The Commission has laid out an aggressive agenda to help address those concerns, and believes that the implementation of this course of action must be the top priority for all those involved in aviation. The Commission expresses its appreciation to: President Clinton, for his heartfelt interest and his strong support for this work; to the 104th Congress, for its decisive action in response to the initial report; to the men and women in numerous government agencies, for their work in identifying issues and in implementing recommendations; and to the representatives of airlines, airports, labor, and general aviation who provided invaluable input. Finally, and especially, the Commission thanks the families of those who have lost loved ones in crashes, for their commitment and their insights, and for ensuring that the Commission always kept its focus on the ultimate goals. - 53 -   APPENDICES A.

Public Meetings of the Commission F. Commission Staff G. Special Acknowledgments H. Commissioner Special Acknowledgments I. Commissioner Cummock Dissent Letter  - 54 -   Appendix A Recommendations of the Members of the Civil Liberties Advisory Panel to the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security The members of the civil liberties advisory panel were invited to meet with the Commission on January 17, 1997, to pose questions and offer their thoughts on the draft proposal to ""implement an automated profiling system for all passengers on all flights."" Draft Proposal II.8. In the absence of any specific information about the profiling system that is being considered, our individual comments at the meeting, and our collective statements set forth below are, of necessity, general in nature. In addition, those comments and these recommendations are limited to the general proposal to finalize and deploy an automated profiling system on a system-wide basis. They do not address the civil liberties implications of other elements of Draft Proposal II.8 (dealing with ""watch lists,"" ""real time"" feedback to airlines, and the creation of a permanent consortium for sharing strategic aviation intelligence), or any other proposals considered by the Commission. In light of the serious civil liberties issues raised by any profiling system, we urge the Commission and the President to consider carefully whether any profiling system is appropriate. Should the Commission decide to recommend an automated profiling system, we urge the Commission to include the following principles among its recommendations (without suggesting that this exhausts the possible civil liberties concerns): 1. Any profile should not contain or be based on material of a constitutionally suspect nature -- e.g., race, religion, national origin of U.S. citizens -- and should be consistent with the constitutional right of freedom to travel. 2. Factors to be considered for elements of the profile should be based on measurable, verifiable data indicating that the factors chosen are reasonable predictors of risk, not stereotypes or generalizations. Efforts should be made to avoid using characteristics that impose a disproportionate burden of inconvenience, embarrassment, or invasion of privacy of members of minority racial, religious or ethnic groups. Law enforcement data should be used with caution and only to the extent that the data used is a reasonable predictor of risk, because these data may be incomplete or inaccurate and may not be directly relevant to the goal of enhancing aviation security. 3. Passengers should be informed of the airlines' security procedures and of their right to avoid any search of their person or luggage by electing not to board the aircraft. When the use of an automated profiling system leads to a request to open luggage or to submit to a personal search, an explicit reminder of the option not to board the aircraft should be given.  - 55 -   4. Searches arising from the use of an automated profiling system should be no more intrusive than search procedures that could be applied to all passengers. For example, imaging devices which project an image of a passenger's body underneath his or her clothing should not be used on a passenger solely because the passenger fits the profile or has been selected at random. The procedures applied to those who fit the profile should also be applied on a random basis to some percentage of passengers who do not fit the profile. 5. Procedures for searching the person or luggage of, or for questioning, a person who is selected by the automated profiling system should be premised on insuring respectful, nonstigmatizing, and efficient treatment of all passengers. 6. The panel is concerned that the maintenance or dissemination of records compiled in connection with an automated profiling system may invade the privacy of passengers. Reasonable restrictions on the maintenance of records and strict limitations on the dissemination of records should be developed. To the extent that records are maintained, there should be means for passengers to challenge the accuracy of personally identifiable information. 7. An independent panel should be appointed and given appropriate authority to monitor implementation of airport security procedures to insure that they do not unduly limit the exercise of civil liberties of the traveling public and do not unduly require augmented searches of the person or baggage of any particular group or groups. 8. Any profiling system should have a sunset a date certain unless an affirmative decision is assessment of the system should take account improvements in detection technology as well provision which requires it to be terminated by made to continue use of the system. The of its efficacy and necessity in light of as the civil liberties impact of the program.  9. Air carrier security plans submitted for approval by the Federal Aviation Administration to implement an automated profiling system should be consistent with these guidelines.

The FAA should develop standards for continuous safety improvement, 1.2 and target its regulatory resources based on performance against those standards. The DOT and the FAA should be more vigorous in the application of 1.3 high standards for certification of aviation businesses. The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) should be simplified and, as 1.4 appropriate, rewritten as plain English, performance-based regulations. Government and industry aviation safety research should focus on 1.6 human factors and training The FAA should work with the aviation community to develop and 1.8 protect the integrity of standard safety databases that can be shared in accident prevention programs. In cooperation with airlines and manufacturers, the FAA's Aging 1.9 Aircraft program should be expanded to cover non-structural systems. 1.10 The FAA should develop better quantitative models and analytic techniques to inform management decision-making. The FAA should develop a revised NAS modernization plan within six 2.1 months that will set a goal of being fully operational nationwide by the year 2005; and the Congress, the Administration, and users should develop innovative means of financing this acceleration. The FAA should develop plans to ensure that operational and airport 2.2 capacity needs are integrated into the modernization of the NAS. The FAA should explore innovative means to accelerate the installation 2.3 of advanced avionics in general aviation aircraft. The United States Government should ensure the accuracy, availability 2.4 and reliability of the GPS system to accelerate its use in NAS modernization and to encourage its acceptance as an international standard for aviation. The FAA should identify and justify the frequency spectrum necessary 2.6 for the transition to a modernized air traffic control system.  - 56 -   Appendix B  Recommendations to be Implemented by the FAA (continued) Rec # Recommendation The federal government should consider aviation security as a national 3.1 security issue, and provide funding for capital improvements. The FAA should implement a comprehensive plan to address the threat 3.4 of explosives and other threat objects in cargo and work with industry to develop new initiatives in this area. The FAA should establish a security system that will provide a high 3.5 level of protection for all aviation information systems. The FAA should work with airlines and airport consortia to ensure that 3.7 all passengers are positively identified and complete security procedures before they board aircraft. 3.10 The FAA should work with industry to develop a national program to increase the professionalism of the aviation security workforce. 3.11 Establish consortia at all commercial airports to implement enhancements to aviation safety and security. 3.14 Deploy existing technology. 3.15 Establish a joint government-industry research and development program. 3.16 Establish an interagency task force to assess the potential use of surface-to-air missiles against commercial aircraft. 3.18 Complement technology with automated passenger profiling. 3.19 Certify screening companies and improve screener performance. 3.21 Use the Customs Service to enhance security. 3.22 Give properly cleared airline and airport security personnel access to the classified information they need to know. Federal agencies should establish peer support programs to assist 4.6 rescue, investigative, law enforcement, counseling and other personnel involved in aviation disaster response.  - 57 -   Appendix C  White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security Membership Lieutenant General James A.

Washington, D.C. 20405  February 19, 1997  Re: Dissent with the Final Report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security Dear Mr. Vice President: It is after much thoughtful consideration and with a very heavy heart that I register my dissent with the final report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. Sadly, the overall emphasis of the recommendations reflects a clear commitment to the enhancement of aviation at the expense of the Commission's mandate of enhancing aviation safety and security. Clearly, as a nation we have the capability to do all three, but sadly as a Commission have not had the moral courage nor will to do so. History has proven the aviation industry's lack of sincerity and willingness to address safety and security on behalf of their customers by continually citing misleading safety statistics as their rationale for inaction. Valid statistics compare apples to apples, yet repeatedly we are inundated with apple to orange comparisons by the industry. Specifically, we must compare injuries and deaths of PASSENGERS ABOARD MASS TRANSPORTATION, not invalid comparisons to automotive injuries and deaths. Even more far fetched was the comparison made to the Commission by Charles Higgins, a Boeing VP citing aviation safety statistics versus household related injuries and death. Yes living is risky, but clearly flying is riskier than traveling on a bus or a train. Last year alone hundreds of passengers died aboard scheduled flights, a far cry from the number of passenger deaths onboard public busses or trains. Detailed below are specific objections to the various passengers and/or air disaster victims issues pertaining to aviation safety and security. Most were raised by family members of the victims of numerous air disasters, ranging from TWA 800, Valujet 592, Sec. Ron Brown's plane, KAL007 and Pan Am 103. Some previous recommendations were omitted entirely, others were included but reduced to a nebulous inactionable mention, while a large number contained language that was either unnecessarily misleading or nonspecific in order to give the perception of recommended change. These are the standards that I recommendations: (a) (b) (c) have applied in evaluating the Commissions' Specificity Responsibility Substance (d) Accountability (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadline   I. IMPROVING AVIATION SAFETY 1.14 ""The commission commends the joint government-industry initiative to equip the cargo holds of all passenger aircraft with smoke detectors, and urges expeditious implementation of the rules and other steps necessary to achieve the goal of both detection and suppression in all cargo holds."" 1.14 Is a statement not a recommendation since it lacks: (a) Specificity (c) Substance (d) Accountability (f) Timetable-Deadline -Require the immediate installation of smoke detectors and fire suppressants in all passenger planes' cargo holds. Rationale: There are approximately 2,900 airplanes without smoker detectors and fire suppressants that regularly fly passengers with hazardous materials and dangerous cargo in the class D cargo holds. The current partial, voluntary deployment of smoke detectors is limited to a handful of airlines, with no time table for completion of installation. Installation of FAA certified fire suppression systems (currently in use on class C cargo holds, new 777 and other planes) must also be mandated. Both systems must be mandated immediately since each are essential for survivability of passengers; detectors warn the cockpit of a problem, while suppressants buys time to land the plane. Estimated cost 30 cents per ticketed passenger. - Mandate installation of passenger protective breathing apparatus effective against smoke, toxic fumes and oxygen deprivation. Rationale: Existing breathing apparatus technology is over 20 yr. old and limited only to oxygen deprivation , but does not protect passengers from smoke or toxic fumes in the cabin . Enhanced breathing apparatus technology is available and FAA certified. The FAA certified technology is on military planes, used by crews on passenger planes, used on Air Force One and Two and numerous corporate/ private planes. Commercial passenger planes should provide equal standard of protection for passengers by providing FAA certified protective breathing apparatus currently used by crews. Estimated cost 4 cents per ticketed passenger. - Ship hazardous materials and dangerous cargo on ""cargo carriers"" until smoke detector, fire suppressant and protective breathing apparatus technology are installed on ""passenger carriers"" for passenger use. Rationale: Until passengers can adequately be protected and increase their survivability from smoke and toxic fumes in the cabin, remove all unnecessary dangerous cargo and hazards materials from passenger carriers. ****** 1.13 ""The FAA should eliminate the exemptions in the Federal Aviation Regulations that allow passengers under the age of two to travel without the benefit of FAA approved restraints."" 1.13 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (f) Timetable/deadline -Require immediate use of FAA certified babyseats for all children under two yrs. ******   I. IMPROVING AVIATION SAFETY  (Continued)  1.5 ""Cost alone should not become dispositive in deciding aviation safety and security rulemaking issues."" 1.5 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (b) Responsibility (c) Substance (d) Accountability (f) timetable/Deadline - Waive FAA/DOT cost/benefit requirement criteria in deciding safety and security rulemaking issues. - Eliminate FAA's authority to issue private or secret exceptions/waivers to safety and security rules, except in very limited and controlled circumstances.. Rationale: Airlines and airports regularly obtain indefinite waivers to safety and/or security rules without knowledge or oversight creating an ineffective regulatory system. Require exceptions or waivers to include a statement of necessity, signed by the air carriers' president, the Assoc. Administrator of FAA for Rulemaking, and reviewed by the FAA Administrator and Chairman of the relevant advisory committee. Any approved waivers or exceptions shall be sent to all members of the FAA's Advisory Committee on Rulemaking (ARAC) and the chairmen of the Senate and House Aviation Subcommittees. - Limit safety/security exceptions/waivers to no more than 6 months. Rationale: The use of indefinite waivers or private exceptions to air safety and security regulations must be limited in time to temporary emergency situations. The current indefinite secret waiver system compromises safety and security, and provides certain carriers with unfair competitive advantages over other carriers that are in compliance with a safety or security regulations. Furthermore, such a system amounts to fraud on the public who is led to believe that safety and security standards and regulations are being complied with and enforced. Time limits of 6 months or less will ensure that remedial actions are undertaken promptly by out of compliance carriers, rather than rewarding out of compliance carriers with indefinite waivers. Pan Am alleged that it had received prior to the Lockerbie bombing a verbal FAA waiver of the security rule requiring hand searching of unaccompanied luggage for Pan Am European locations. Pan Am claimed this waiver allowed it merle to X-ray unaccompanied luggage. It is quite possible that the bomb which destroyed Pan Am 103 could have been discovered if a then excising FAA security regulation had been strictly followed and enforced. The criminal investigation determined that an unaccompanied bag containing a Toshiba cassette played packed with explosives destroyed the jumbo jet over Lockerbie resulting in the worst terrorist attack against U.S. civilians in history. III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS With the current day realities of domestic terrorism such as the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City, combined with the numerous successful airmail bombs sent by a variety of disgruntled criminals, the Unibomber, and the recent Egyptian letter bombs, domestically the flying public is now flying less secure than when my husband John and his fellow passengers died aboard Pan Am 103! To-date, both the FAA and Dept. of Transportation have required only minimal changes in aviation security for international flights and have maintained the status-quo for domestic flights, not only leaving aviation's back door unlocked, but wide open .   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  The security preamble on p.25 effectively ignores the significant measures taken unilaterally by the FAA in the mid- 1985 to protect U.S. International Aviation from bombs in unaccompanied checked baggage (FAA Aircarrier Standard Security Program (ACSSP), Section XV,C,1,(a) July 7, 1985) 1. It also ignores the joint actions, or is ignorant of, the joint actions by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation and her Canadian counterpart, the Minister of Transport, to get the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to adopt ICAO Annex 17 Security Standards to protect international aviation against bombs in 1985. This ICAO Security Standard 4.3.1 states: ""Each Contracting State shall establish measures to ensure that operators when providing service from that State do not transport the baggage of passengers who are not on board the aircraft unless the baggage separated from the passengers is subject to other security measures. Note- This Standard has been applicable since 19 December 1987 with respect to the baggage of passengers at the point of origin and on-line transfer passengers. With respect to the baggage of other categories of passengers, the Standard became applicable on 1 April 1989."" This specific ICAO Security Standard was not only significant from the protection it provided against unaccompanied baggage but also because it has the distinction of being ratified by a majority of ICAO Contracting States in a record time of a few months. These actions sometimes take years to win adoption. These are still mandatory ICAO requirements and the U.S. is a ICAO Contracting State and thus is to comply with these procedures internationally. These ICAO Security Standards, set in the mid to late 1980's, internationally recognized that the primary threat to civil aviation had shifted from hijacking to sabotage requiring specific security measures that both the U.S. and ICAO would undertake to protect air passengers against bombs. Needless to say, if the public was aware of the test results of the ""Red Team"" aviation security forces domestically to regularly and successfully breach the so called ""Aviation Security"" systems, in combination with the aforementioned domestic terrorist acts and threats, they would be shocked and terrified at how much they are currently at risk. Even of greater concern are that the recommendations in this report will do nothing more than give the flying public the perception of security. They do not provide any tangible or immediate improvement in our security measures. Once again, we will enable the tombstone mentality that is pervasive of the FAA, DOT and the U.S. airlines to continue. This report contains no specific call to action, no commitments to address aviation security system-wide by mandating the deployment of current technology and training, with actionable timetables and budgets. As the previous commission on aviation security and terrorism noted eight years ago, "" The U.S. civil aviation security system is seriously flawed and has failed to provide the proper level of protection for the traveling public. This system needs major reform. Rhetoric is no substitute for strong, effective action.""  1 This FAA ACSSP requirements stated than a U.S. airline could not carry an unaccompanied bag from a designated high-threat international airport unless the bag had been physically searched. This FAA unaccompanied bag requirement preceded the subsequent ICAO Accompanied Bag Standard by 2  years. Pan American World Airways failure to comply with this FAA security requirement resulted in the PAA-103 tragedy on December 21, 1988 and the airline's conviction of ""Willful Misconduct"" in U.S. Federal Court on July 10, 1992.   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  3.1 ""The federal government should consider aviation security as a national security issue, and provide substantial funding for capitol improvements."" 3.1 Recommendation lacks (c) Substance (d) Accountability (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadlines - Mandate the establishment of a federal passenger ""User Security Surcharge"" - Sequester funds solely to be allocated for the purchase/development: - EDS (Explosive Detection Systems) equipment grant money - R & D grant money for EDS development for cargo, mail, carry on and checked baggage. - Standardized Training Programs for Security Personnel - FBI Fingerprinting/National NCIC Criminal Background Checks - Deploy hardened baggage containers through attrition - Interim purchase of automated bag match technology - Development of Profi ling Programs - Manual/Automated - Fund Explosive Detection Canine Teams The initial $160 million in federal funds provided by Congress in 1996 was woefully inadequate to address the scope of the problems in U.S. aviation security. There are 450 commercial airports that have obsolete security systems, most of which is 20 yrs. old and designed for anti-hijacking system. This technology provides basic metal detection X-ray technology with no explosive detection capabilities for carry on baggage. Outside of the limited deployment of CTX 5000 SP, this is also true for checked baggage. Additionally, this funding does not address inadequate security personnel selection/training). Likewise, ""$100 million annual recommendation by the Gore Commission.....to meet capitol requirements identified by local airport consortia and FAA"" is woefully inadequate to meet anti-sabotage aviation security needs. A ""passenger user security surcharge"" of ($4-5) would raise in excess of $2 Billion a year, swiftly and adequately funding the actual cost to upgrade aviation security to an effective level. A ""passenger user surcharge,"" sequestered only for security is the most viable method to raise the large amount of capitol needed to adequately address the changes system wide, due to the inaccessibility/deficit of general revenue funds and/or aviation trust funds. Security related expenses should not be considered a part of the airlines cost of doing business, but a part of our National responsibility to protect our citizens. "" Security "" threats typically are not targeted against a specific airline but after the American Flag on the tail of passenger carriers. There must be a clear, consistent source of revenue and commitment in order to adequately protect our citizens. Rationale: Since the bombing of Pan Am 103 there have been numerous but unsuccessful attempts at ""aviation security enhancements"" by the former President Bush's Commission on Aviation Security & Terrorism, Congress and two Administrations. For 8+ yr. without an adequate and consistent funding mechanism in place to implement recommendations, legislation's (i.e. ""1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act"") or regulations , the obsolete security status-quo has prevailed. Note: Section 107(9) ""1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act"" - entitled ""Authorization of Appropriations."" There are authorized to be appropriated from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund,.such sums of money necessary for the purpose of caring out the technology grant program."" In 7 yr. no security funds were made available due to budget constraints in the Trust Fund. ******   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  3.3 "" The Postal Service should advise customers that all packages weighing over 16 ounces will be subject to examination for explosives and other threat objects in order to move by air."" 3.3 Recommendation lacks: (c) Substance (e) Applicability (f) Timetable/Deadline -Mandate immediate examination of all packages weighing over 8 ounces or move them on ""cargo"" carriers. -Required the research and development of (EDS) explosive detection systems for mail. Rationale: Forensic scientists who investigated the bombing of Pan Am 103 estimated that the bomb used contained as little as 9.6 ounces of explosives. While I commend the Commissions' recommendation a more effective and realistic solution is required by changing the recommendation to 8 versus 16 ounces. Additionally, Section 112(b,1)of the ""1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act"" entitled, ""Screening Mail and Cargo"" stated "" require for mail and cargo the same screening procedures as are required for checked baggage."" ****** 3.5 ""The FAA should implement a comprehensive plan to address the threat of explosives and other threat objects in cargo and work with industry to develop new initiatives in this area."" 3.5 Recommendation lacks (a) Specificity (c) Substance (d) Accountability (f) Timetables/Deadlines -Mandate immediate examination of all cargo or move cargo on ""cargo"" carriers. -Required the research and development of (EDS) explosive detection systems for cargo. Rationale: Profiling relies on the honesty of the shipper and is not an effective security tool in itself since many shippers and freight forwarders regularly combine questionable cargo together that are manifested as ""known"" shipments. Currently, all express packages shipped by express mail companies are considered as ""known"" shipments and don not require further scrutiny. Additionally, EDS for cargo has not been developed yet ! Additionally, Section 112(b,1)of the ""1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act"" entitled, ""Screening Mail and Cargo"" stated "" require for mail and cargo the same screening procedures as are required for checked baggage."" ****** 3.7 "" The FAA should work with airlines and airport consortia to ensure that all passengers are positively identified and subject to security procedures before they board aircraft."" 3.7 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (c) Substance (e) Applicability (f) Timetable/Deadline - Eliminate the issuance of advanced boarding passes and require that all passengers, including electronically ticketed passengers, check-in with a airline employee prior to boarding a flight until EDS is utilized systemwide. Rationale : Current airline ticketing procedure allows passenger to be issued advanced boarding passes with seat assignments. Passengers with advance issued boarding passes can   walk directly to the jet bridge entrance at the boarding gate, present the boarding pass to an airline employee, and have a cursory security and identification take place. While this procedure provides a convenience   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  to the passenger, it takes away from airline security procedures. The FAA should implement a regulatory change requiring that all air carriers stop issuing advanced boarding passes and ticketless travel. Require all passengers including those participating in electronic ticketing to check-in at an airline counter or gate check-in desk prior to boarding, until explosive detection technology is in place for passenger carry on bags and checked baggage. ****** 3.10 ""The FAA should work with industry to develop a national program to increase the professionalism of the aviation security workforce, including screening personnel."" 3.10 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (b) Responsibility(c) Substance (d) Accountability (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadline Rationale: This recommendation contains a number of admirable objectives but it, like its predecessor recommendation in President Bush's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism lacks teeth. Following President Bush's Commission of Aviation Security and Terrorism and the follow-on Aviation Security Improvement Act in 1990, the FAA established standards for the selection and training of aviation security personnel. Those standards were, and still are, totally inadequate. There is nothing to prevent the same inadequate actions by the FAA to this recommendation. The Commission should specifically recommend that the FAA mandate 80 hours of intensive classroom/laboratory and 40 hours of On-the-Job training before performance certification for all airline security screening personnel. ****** 3.11 ""Establish consortia at all commercial airports to implement enhancements to aviation safety and security."" 3.11 Recommendation lacks (b) Responsibility (d) Accountability (f) Timetables/Deadline - Require all 450 Commercial Airports to immediately establish a local consortia to implement safety and security FAA and DOT mandates Rationale: Only about 10% or 41 out of 450 commercial airports have established consortia. Since effective security is as good as its weakest link, a system wide approach to implement federal standards must be required. The local consortia role should be limited to executing minimal federal safety and security standards not to determining the federal standards. For example, the consortia can determine the best placement for deployment of EDS but not if, how many or when to install explosive detection systems. ****** 3.13 ""Conduct airport vulnerability assessments and develop action plans."" 3.13 Recommendation lacks (a) Specificity (d) Accountability (f) Timetables/Deadline Rationale: This recommendation does not contain criteria to ensure that follow-up actions are taken to problems identified during vulnerability assessments. The recommendation for FAA ""Red Teams"" test of airport security systems outlined in 3.21 should be tied to this recommendation to ensure that these assessments do not continue the incestuous process where security problems are rationalized away and no corrective actions are taken within a specified period of time. Additionally, a dis-interested third party should be contracted to work with the FAA to conduct airport and/or airline tests in order to avoid a conflict of interest. ******   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  3.14 ""Require criminal background checks and FBI fingerprint checks for all screeners, and all airport and airline employees with access to secure areas . ..... The Commission reiterates that the overall goal is FBI fingerprint check of all airport and airline employees with access to secure areas, no later than mid-1999 "" 3.14 Recommendation lacks (a) Specificity (b) Substance (f) Timetable/Deadline - Require immediate and direct access to NCIC III for comprehensive evaluations of screeners and all individuals with unescorted access to secure areas of airports. NCIC will be used as a ""trigger"" for a FBI criminal record prior to granting unescorted access to secure areas. Use NCIC as an interim measure pending IAFIS for conducting fingerprint generated FBI criminal history checks by mid - 1999. Rationale : The aviation industry must be required to provide the same degree of employment security review that is currently required of employees hired by banks and security exchange companies. Double standards must be eliminated to adequately protect peoples lives equal to protecting peoples money. The"" FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996"" section 304 entitled ""Requirement for criminal history checks"" did not require security checks equal to that of the banking or securities industries. The legislation allows for ineffective ""local"" criminal background checks on the basis of an array of triggering criteria such as ""(I) an employment investigation leaves a gap in employment of 12 months or more..""etc. The ""1990 Aviation Security Improvement Act"" section 105 (2 a-c) required national criminal history checks as did the Bush Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism. We can not expect to have any meaningful security measures implemented if the background of thousands of airport personnel is potentially questionable ****** 3.15 ""Deploy existing technology."" 3.15 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (c) Substance (f) Timetable/Deadlines Rationale: This recommendation is far too nebulous and vague. It like many other recommendations contain no deadlines and is quite non-specific in addressing several needed technology additions to the U.S. aviation security system. The statement recognizing "" . . . that deployed technology for examining carry-on baggage may be outdated"" was a major understatement. The facts are that the technology currently in use for examining carry-on baggage is not capable of automatically detecting explosives, and in many instances is not even capable of imaging explosives compounds . I believe that an unequivocal recommendation should be made to change out all technology that is currently used to screen carry-on luggage. Moreover, I believe that on-going research that is funded by the FAA should be accelerated to complete the development and deployment of walk-through trace explosives detectors that can be used to examine passengers for explosives residues. Additionally, the deployment of 54 advanced explosive detection systems for checked bag to cover 450 commercial airports does very little to catch up with 20 yr. of technology advancements in a meaningful way to protect the flying public . ******   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  3.16 "" Establish a joint government-industry research and development program."" 3.16 Recommendation lacks: (c0 Substance (d) Accountability(f) Timetable/Deadline Rationale: The current $3 million FAA R&D budget is totally inadequate to research & develop technology for screening cargo, mail, checked bag, carry on bags and passengers. Adoption of a ""Passenger Security Surcharge"" of ($4-5) could generate substantial revenue to adequately accelerate the aviation R&D process, deploy existing technology and provide adequate security personnel training programs. ****** 3.19 ""Compliment technology with automated passenger profiling."" 3.19 Recommendation lacks: (c) Substance (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadlines Rationale: I agree that profiles can be most useful as an overall part of a multi-layered security system. This recommendation has placed an over-reliance, and therefore unrealistic expectations on an early development and the widespread application of an automated profile system. The historical review of attempts to automate profiles within airline's computer system takes us back to the mid-l980's when a fledging attempt was made to do so by TWA. I believe that a realistic implementation date for a fully automated profile system that interfaces with law enforcement and intelligence agencies will take several years to accomplish. I state this mindful of the substantial amount of work that must be done by the FBI, CIA, and BATF (and others) in building terrorist databases on which detailed profile elements can be built. In addition, interfacing any such data base with airline computer systems will, in itself; be a major undertaking. Nonetheless, I recognize that a limited automated profile system such as Northwest Airlines' CAPS can be developed and implemented more quickly. While I applaud and support the effort to automate the CAPS system I doubt that the additional programming for CAPS use outside of the Northwest Airlines system can be completed by August 1997. In the interim I urge the FAA mandate the use of manual profiles to identify the small minority of passengers that may merit additional attention. Another serious concern regarding the recommended use of profiles to trigger the use of a passenger/baggage match. This process is actually less effective than the procedures Pan Am was using (illegally) that led to the destruction of Pan Am 103 on December 21, 1988. If profiles are a necessary part of a good layered security system then full baggage/passenger match is as well. The recommendation to base passenger/baggage match on profile and random selectees is unacceptable. I believe that both security efficiency techniques, i.e., profiles and full bag/passenger match, should be equally applied throughout the U.S. aviation security system. In fact full automated baggage/passenger match procedures can be implemented immediately and provide an immediate substantive increase in our aviation security system. As noted above, this is not so for the recommended automated profile system in 3.19. ******   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  3.20 ""Certify screening companies and improve screener performance."" 3.20 Recommendation lacks (a) Specificity (d) Accountability (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadlines - FAA mandate 80 hours of intensive classroom/laboratory and 40 hours of On-the-Job training, before performance certification, for all airline security screening personnel. Rationale: Currently, screeners typically receive 8 hr. of combined class room and on-the-job training. Most security screeners are minimum wage employees required to buy their uniforms and pay for parking daily. Airlines typically pay airplane cleaners more that security screeners, hence a 200-400 % employment turnover rate exists for security screeners. Security screeners are an integral part of a effective security system. Security screeners must be selected and trained adequately, paid fairly and given the appropriate technology tools to do their job. ****** 3.23 ""Give properly cleared airline and airport security personnel access to the classified information they need to know."" 3.23 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (c) Substance Rationale: It is my understanding that the problem of distribution of classified intelligence information extends to FAA Regional and Field facilities. Here the primary problem is no one without clearance is to see classified data (the persons needing access are FAA employees). In this instance it is a problem of a failure of the FAA to establish a requirement for their employees to see the data and to establish a means of rapid distribution of the information to its own field employees. ****** 3.24 ""Begin implementation of full bag-passenger match....the Commission believes that bag match, initially based on profiling, should be implemented no later than December 31, 1997...........By that date, the bags of those selected either at random or through the use of automated profiling must either be screened or matched to a boarded passenger...."" 3.24 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (b) Responsibility(c) Substance (d) Accountability (e) Applicability (f) Timetables/Deadline Rationale: The recommendation states that "" the Commission remains committed to baggage match as a component of a comprehensive, layered security program aimed at keeping bombs and explosive devices off airlines"" but subsequent comments tie bag-match to profiles and random selections. I do not take issue that bag-match should be specifically applied to ""profile selectees"" and/or random selection of passengers as both these measures are a welcome addition to our aviation security system. I do however, adamantly object to a failure to endorse the immediate application of a full-baggage/passenger match. The enclosed detection matrix in Figure 1 (see p.___) illustrates that the terrorist bomb that downed Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988 would only have been caught by either a full-baggage/passenger match or through and examination of the suitcase carrying the bomb using the new CTX-5000SP EDS. Applying a profile in this instance would not have worked because there was never a passenger ever associated with the bag containing the bomb. Since you can only profile passengers (not bags) the bag with the bomb would not have been detected .   III. IMPROVING SECURITY FOR TRAVELERS  (Continued)  As there are no current plans to screen all baggage using a CTX-5000SP EDS then the only reliable security counter measure (see Figure 1 detection matrix) available to serve as an alert to a Pan Am-103 type of attack is the full-bag/passenger match. Therefore the recommended application of a bag-match to a ""profile selectee"", i.e., a passenger, will not catch a Pan Am103 type of attack. The second approach is to applying a bag-match was to randomly select passengers. (see Figures 2-3 p. ) As no passenger was ever associated with the Pan Am-103 bomb then this part of the recommendation to apply a bag-passenger match to randomly selected passengers would also not stop a Pan Am-103 type of attack. I cannot accept this recommendation as Pan American World Airways was illegally using an originating passenger bag-match (partial passenger-bag match) procedure that resulted in the death of my husband and 269 other people. To do so would be unconscionable. IV. RESPONDING TO AVIATION DISASTERS 4.3 "" The Department of Transportation and the NTSB should implement key provisions of the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 by March 31, 1997.......The Commission urges the task force to consider the development of uniform guidelines.."" 4.3 Recommendation lacks (a) Specificity (c) Substance (e) Applicability and actionable timetable. 4.3 ""Air Disaster Family Assistance Act"" Title VII, section 705 of the ""FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996"" requires the establishment of a joint task force, including ""families which have been involved in aircraft accidents ."" Task force should address and develop uniform federal standards for: - Civilians killed on government planes - American passengers on U.S. carriers that crash internationally. -Notification procedures of families of air disasters -Autopsy procedures -DNA testing -Care and disposition of unidentified remains (i.e. knowledge and consent by next-of-kin prior to burial or disposition) -Personal possession decontamination, return and/or disposition (i.e. knowledge and consent by next-of-kin prior to disposition) -Media access to survi vors and victims families -Legal solicitation/Access to survivors and victims families -Develop and distribute a ""Disaster Response Information Pamphlet"" to air disaster victims and their families. Rationale: ""Implementation of key provisions of the act by March 31, 1997"" can only be accomplished with the input of all parties as cited by the law (including the victims families). Family representatives have not been named or included in a task force nor provided equal access to work group meetings or received underlying documents to allow them to assist in the work in progress. Additionally, representation of both the legal and media are a necessary part of the process to develop guidelines and negotiate the MOU (memoranda of understanding) between all organizations responding to air disasters. ******   IV. RESPONDING TO AVIATION DISASTERS  (Continued)  4.4 "" The U.S. Government should ensure that family members of victims of international aviation disasters receive just compensation and equitable treatment through the application of federal laws and international treaties."" 4.4 Recommendation lacks: (a) Specificity (e) Applicability (f) Timetable/Deadline 4.4 Restore passenger rights whether crashes occur over land, territorial waters or over the high seas. Equality in awardable damages can be restored by amendment to 49 U.S.C. 40120. Rationale: Currently the application of law for aircraft that crash over water (three miles or more off shore) is based on a 1920's treaty ""Death on the High Seas Act,"" limiting liability of air carrier or manufacturer up to $2,300. Ironically, DOHSA was adopted prior to start of commercial passenger air transportation, yet it still applies to air disasters such as recently as TWA 800, Aeroperu, KAL007 and others. Since all international flights and most domestic landing approaches on our coasts are over water this unjust and inequitable system must be abolished. Airlines and manufacturers have hidden behind DOHSA indefinitely avoiding swift and adequate compensation of victims families requiring prolonged trial lasting over a decade. - Provide the same venue (U.S. Courts jurisdiction) for U.S. citizens regardless of where their tickets were bought , changed or if they live abroad. U.S. jurisdiction can be obtained by amendment to 49 U.S.C. 40105. Rationale: Presently, U.S. citizens are afforded U.S. court jurisdiction only if their ticket was purchased in the U.S. Over 5 million Americans live, work and travel outside the U.S. depriving them and their families of swift and adequate damages in case of air disasters . Airlines and manufacturers have hidden behind jurisdictional issues to indefinitely avoiding swift and adequate compensation of victims families requiring prolonged international trials lasting over a decade and compensatory damages or awards paid in foreign currency. -Require uniform certification standards and mandate adequate levels of liability insurance on all non-scheduled commercial passenger air travel (i.e. charters) Rationale: Privatization and deregulation has created a sizable market of non scheduled air entities that regularly transport private citizens, government employees and military. Many private charters temporarily lease aircraft and crews with questionable certification, maintenance and recurrent training, putting unwitting passengers at great unnecessary risk. Mandate equal requirement levels of certification for scheduled and non-scheduled passenger flights. Note: Most personal life and travel insurance policies exclude payment of charter related claims since charters do not afford passengers the established scheduled commercial passengers air travel safety standards.   CONCLUSIONS In summary, the final report contains no specific call to action, no commitments to address aviation safety and security system-wide by mandating the deployment of current technology and training, with actionable timetables and budgets. Later attempts to track these recommendations will result in problems with differing agency interpretations, misunderstandings, and outright opposition to implementation by individuals and/or organizations who oppose the specific recommendations. I recommend that time limits for completion be added to all recommendations that have no deadlines and that all recommendations be re-written for specific actions by specific agencies with an accountability matrix added for follow-on actions to ensure that the recommendations are implemented. Without specifics, once again we will allow the airlines to lead and the government follow as to what is necessary to secure the flying public. Sadly we remain, as noted eight years ago, by our predecessor commission, President Bush's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism which concluded that, "" The U.S. civil aviation security system is seriously flawed and has failed to provide the proper level of protection for the traveling public. This system needs major reform. Rhetoric is no substitute for strong, effective action."" At best, these recommendations allow and encourage more research, more pilot programs and more analysis. Once again, it leaves in place domestically and internationally, highly limited anti-hijacking machines that provide basic metal detection X-ray technology with no explosive detection capabilities for carry on baggage. Outside of the limited deployment (54 units ) of CTX 5000SP, this is also true for checked in baggage. Until Explosive detection technology is ordered in sufficient quantities and deployed system wide, specific efficiency measures must be implemented to identify which bags out of the millions transported annually need further scrutiny. Matching bags to passengers does this. Sadly, the commissions recommendation matches bags only to ""Selectees"" after profiling. Partial bag match does not allow for the identification of an unaccompanied ""rouge"" bag since it requires a ""passenger Selectee"" to trigger matching passengers to their bags and further scrutiny. The automated profiling system developed by Northwest Airlines and the FAA will rely on the ability of a skycab or a counter check in agent to successfully verify a passengers identity as the same individual the computer profiled. Currently the airlines are not required to collect complete passenger manifest data on either domestic or international flights. We have seen the short comings of incomplete fight manifest information, as evident every time a plane crashes. It often takes the airlines days to notify victims families since without complete names, the airlines don't accurately know who boarded the plane. Profiling will now rely on the incomplete passenger data to produce a ""Selectee"" in order to identify the bags that need further scrutiny. While I greatly support the upgrade in training and certification of security screeners and personnel, we can not expect them to adequately perform their jobs in detecting explosives inside carry on bags with minimal training and obsolete 8-20 yr. old anti-hijacking technology designed to detect metal and not explosives. We must deploy state of the art screening technology with at least limited EDS (Explosive Detection) capabilities.   CONCLUSIONS (Continued) In terms of mail and cargo transported on passengers planes, the recommendations do not provide any meaningful degree of protection for the flying public nor require and fund Research & Development of EDS (Explosion Detection Systems). Based on the threat of letter bombs/packages and the systemwide vulnerability that exist in the belly of every passenger plane the recommendations do not provide either a short or long term fix. Mr. Vice President, we are all aware that any comprehensive security system is as good as its weakest link. Criminals and terrorist will continue to identify and exploit the weakest link in our defenses. Nationally, there are over 450 commercial airports with scheduled passenger flights. It is up to the Federal government that regulates the airlines to provide national security standards, adequate funding and actionable timetables. Anything short of that does not fulfill the Commissions mandate of enhancing aviation security in a meaningful way. The Boeing chart on p.6 projects an aviation accident a week by the year 2015 based on the projected increases in air traffic. That acknowledges 250-300 people will die onboard passenger airplanes a week; 1,000-1,200 a month or projected total deaths of 12,00015,000 annually ! Statistically, that compares weekly commercial aviation deaths to the weekly death toll in the Vietnam War. This is totally unacceptable and an outrage ! Commercial air travel need not bear the same risk as going to war. In closing, Mr. Vice President, I feel that the flying public should be able to put their family members aboard a plane with a great degree of confidence that they will walk off at the point of their destination and not come home in a body bag like my husband did. It is for all the aforementioned safety and security reasons that I can not sign a report that blatantly allows the American flying public to be placed regularly at ""unnecessary risk"" while we as a nation have the capability , but not the will to reasonably protect them. For the record, I take objection to the inclusion of any ""Classified Annex"" to the Final Report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. If a classified annex was issued in the name of the Commissioners, it has been included without privying all the Commissioners to the contents, issues, or providing applicable background data or conclusions, with our knowledge or consent. Sincerely,  M. Victoria Cummock Commissioner, White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security Member, FAA Security Baseline Work Group President, Families of Pan Am 103/Lockerbie Widow of John Binning Cummock"
GX048-35-3199036	"The SM-55 was one of the planes that crossed the Atlantic before Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight.                    General Italo Balbo.                    The Sovoia-Marchetti S.66 was used by the Italian airline, Ala Littoria, in the 1930s.                    This SM.83 was owned by Prince Bibesco of Romania in the late 1930s.                 Savoia-Marchetti    In Germany, the Nazis held power from 1933 to 1945. Their allies included Italy, which was ruled by the dictator Benito Mussolini. With his strong encouragement, Italy built on earlier achievements and became a significant power in the world of aviation.   With a population of more than 40 million during the 1930s, Italy had a well-developed aviation industry that numbered some 18 companies, along with other firms that built engines. The planebuilders included Fiat, which became renowned for its motorcars. Leaders in the industry included the firm of Savoia-Marchetti, which had been formed in 1915. It took its name from Umberto Savoia, a founder of the company and one of Italy's earliest aviators, having taken his first flying lesson from Wilbur Wright, and from the chief designer Alessandro Marchetti, who came to the company with a design for a high-speed biplane.   Marchetti had joined that company in 1922, in the same year that Mussolini seized power. He quickly showed his technical strength as his first design, the SM-51 racing seaplane, set a speed record of 174 miles per hour (280 kilometers per hour). In 1925 he introduced the first version of the SM-55. This was a long-range flying boat with twin hulls like those of a catamaran. The arrangement made the plane stable in heavy seasand provided ample room between the hulls for mines or torpedoes.   The SM-55 became one of the airplanes that crossed the Atlantic before Lindbergh's flight in May 1927. This happened in February of 1927, when Francesco de Pinedo took one named  Santa   Maria  to Pernambuco, Brazil, with stops along the way in Morocco and Dakar, on Africa's west coast. In contrast to Lindbergh's  Spirit of St. Louis , the  Santa Maria  could land safely on the water. It came equipped with a seawater distiller, a life raft, and fishing equipment.   Mussolini's air marshal, General Italo Balbo, soon was flying the Atlantic not with single airplanes but with entire fleets. Again these were SM-55s, which could refuel en route in the Azores. In 1930, Balbo led 12 of them on a 6,500-mile (10,461-kilometer) flight from Rome to Rio de Janeiro. Then, in 1933, he took 24 of these flying boats on a triumphant mission that arrived in New York and in Chicago when Chicago was hosting a world's fair. In the course of its career, the SM-55 held 14 world records for speed, altitude, load, and distance. It also proved rugged enough to survive being towed for 200 miles (322 kilometers) across open sea to the Azores, when one of them had to set down in mid-ocean.   Another of Marchetti's designs, the SM-64, also set distance records. In 1928 it covered 4,764 miles (7,667 kilometers) along a closed course that resembled a big racetrack while staying aloft for over 58 hours. This was a warm-up for a nonstop transatlantic flight to Brazil a month later. When French aviators took the world closed-circuit distance record, the Italians were not dismayed. Using another SM-64, they won back the record by covering 5,088 miles (8,188 kilometers) in 1930, taking 67 hours.   In 1934, the firm of Macchi brought out its MC-72 racing seaplane. Fitted with two engines set back to back that together produced 2,800 horsepower (2,088 kilowatts), it set a speed record of 440.5 miles per hour (709 kilometers per hour), which stood for five years. In 1935, Mussolini hosted an important conference on aeronautics. The attendees included Germany's Adolf Busemann, who proposed that  swept wings  would permit flight beyond the speed of sound. Italy also built one of the world's first  supersonic   wind tunnels , near Rome. Its director, Antonio Ferri, emigrated to the United States in 1944 and rose to leadership in the field of high-speed propulsion.   Savoia-Marchetti's prestige flights brought luster to Mussolini's regime, but he was a man of war and he wanted bombers. As a prelude, Savoia-Marchetti built the three-engine SM-73 transport, which carried 18 passengers. Entering production during 1934, it established the three-engine layout that became standard for the bombers.   The first such bomber, the SM-81, served as a front-line weapon until it gave way to the more capable SM-79, beginning in 1937. The SM-81 particularly helped Mussolini during the mid-1930s, when he invaded Ethiopia. He did it because he wanted to build an empire, and in an era when most of Africa was ruled by the British and French, Ethiopia was one of the few territories that had held its independence. Flying out of Italy's colony of Eritrea, SM-81s used wings that were painted with bold red stripes to make these planes easy to spot from the air when they went down in desert.   Following his conquest of Ethiopia, Mussolini intervened in the Spanish Civil War. This was a prelude to World War II, with Germany and Italy supporting the victorious Nationalists, who defeated the Republicans that were allied with the Soviet Union. The Italians flew in Spain with both the SM-81 and -79. As the latter became available in substantial numbers, it emerged as Italy's main bomber in that war.   The historian Walter Boyne writes that the SM-79 compared well with wartime twin-engine bombers such as Britain's  Bristol  Blenheim and Germany's  Heinkel  He 111. It had a top speed of 270 miles per hour (435 kilometers per hour), a range of nearly 1,250 miles (2,012 kilometers), and a bomb load of 2,750 pounds (1,247 kilograms). The Regia Aeronautica, the Italian Air Force, quickly adopted the SM-79 as its principal bomber. When Italy entered World War II, in June 1940, it held nearly a thousand bombers. Close to 600 of them were SM-79s.   Boyne describes it as ""probably the best torpedo bomber of the war, in any Air Force."" Italy thus used it to good effect against Allied convoys. Still, while Mussolini had won easy victories in Ethiopia and Spain, he now faced the far more formidable armed forces of Britain and America. His men fought gallantly, flying SM-79s against such heavily defended targets as Malta, a key British naval and air base in the Mediterranean. By then, however, Italy was sending warplanes dating to the 1930s against enemy aircraft that were considerably more modern. Italy surrendered as early as 1943, and thereafter stayed in the war only through direct support from Germany.   The end of the war also brought an end to Italy's independent aviation industry. Savoia-Marchetti stayed alive for a time by building trucks and railway coaches, but went bankrupt in September 1951. The firm emerged from bankruptcy two years later and began crafting light aircraft, often in partnership with other firms. After 1977, this company worked increasingly on helicopters in association with the firm of Agusta. In 1983, Agusta took it over as a subsidiary, erasing its name a few years later. Even so, as part of Agusta, it continues to remain in business.   —T.A. Heppenheimer        Bibliography          Boyne, Walter J.  Clash of Wings: Air Power in World War II .

Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government detected a  distress signal from a 53-foot sailing vessel around 10:00 a.m. on Feb. 24. The vessel  had sunk, and the four people onboard were adrift in a life raft when a Navy helicopter  from Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, came to their aid. The four people  were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to the Naval base.     As the vessel sank, its 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon  (EPIRB) was activated. The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and  NOAA notified the Coast Guard.     The U.S. Coast Guard's Rescue Sub-Center (RSC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico,  contacted all agencies in the area requesting air support for a long-range offshore flight,  but no aircraft were immediately available. San Juan RSC then contacted Coast Guard  District 7 in Miami for additional air support. A Coast Guard C-130 Hercules (CG1712)  was airborne in the Windward Pass and was diverted to the scene with about eight  hours left of flight time. The aircraft received a strong signal from the 121.5 MHz homer  in the EPIRB, and was able to home in on the life raft with the four persons on board.   The C-130 deployed a small survival pack to the stranded sailors until they could be  rescued.     San Juan RSC again contacted Navy Helicopter Squadron VC-8 in Roosevelt  Roads and was told that an H-3 Search and Rescue helicopter was now available.   After a two hour flight from Puerto Rico, the H-3 arrived on scene and hoisted the four  sailors from the life raft. None of the rescued were reported to have any serious  injuries. The cause of the sinking is yet unknown, but weather conditions were reported  to be less than favorable with winds around 25 knots and four-to-five-foot seas.      The crew of the sailing vessel said they are thankful their emergency beacon  saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment can mean the difference between life  and death.      ""The Search and Rescue program is truly an international humanitarian  program,"" said Ajay Mehta, manager of NOAA's Sarsat program. ""This particular  rescue illustrates the international aspect of the program. The vessel was registered  with the United Kingdom and three of the people rescued were from Great Britain, the  fourth was from Spain. Yet, U.S. search and rescue teams joined together to come to  the aid of these individuals.""      The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and  polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress.   NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA  Satellite and Data Service) represents the United States in this program, providing  satellite platforms and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control  Center.    NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can  instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect  emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole.

Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government detected a  distress signal from the 53-foot fishing vessel Mediterranean Sea II Jan. 6. The crew  was airlifted by Coast Guard Search and Rescue teams.       The vessel, 50 miles southeast of Cape Fear, had electrical and engine room  fires, and was without electricity and engine power in rough seas. A large wave hit the  bow of the ship and destroyed the windscreen on the bridge. The vessel was taking on  water.     The crew manually activated their 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio  beacon (EPIRB) after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding on the  vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat  system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard.The crew manually activated their 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio  beacon (EPIRB) after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding on the  vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat  system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard.      ""While the cause of the incident is not yet known, six lives were saved by the use  of properly working safety gear such as an EPIRB and lifejackets. With the EPIRB, we  were able to quickly find their location and in this case able to save their lives,"" said  LCDR Brendan McPherson, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard Atlantic Area  Command, headquartered in Portsmouth, Va.      When the Coast Guard received the distress alert from NOAA, a search was  started with air crews from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., in an HH-60  Jayhawk helicopter, a C-130 Hercules aircraft and an HH-65 Dolphin helicopter from  Coast Guard Air Facility Charleston, S.C.       The first helicopter on scene was the rescue helicopter from Air Facility  Charleston finding the Mediterranean Sea II almost completely submerged and some  fishermen jumping into the water. All of the fishermen were wearing survival suits and  Personal Flotation Devices. Three fishermen were hoisted aboard the helicopter and  taken to safety.       The helicopter from Air Station Elizabeth City arrived shortly and hoisted the  three remaining fishermen to safety from 10-15 foot seas, sustained winds of 25 mph,  and gusts nearing 50 mph. The fishermen were taken to North Myrtle Beach Grand  Strand Airport, N.C., in good condition.      The crew of the Mediterranean Sea II, homeported in Little River, S.C., said they  are thankful their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment  can mean the difference between life and death.      The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and  polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress.

GX001-79-1866959	"National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Chronology of Selected Highlights in the First 100 American Spaceflights, 1961-1995          May 5, 1961:  Freedom 7 , the first piloted Mercury spacecraft (No. 7) carrying Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., was launched from Cape Canaveral by MercuryRedstone (MR3) launch vehicle, to an altitude of 115 nautical miles and a range of 302 miles. It was the first American space flight involving human beings. Shepard demonstrated that individuals can control a vehicle during weightlessness and high G stresses, and significant scientific biomedical data were acquired. He reached a speed of 5,100 miles per hour and his flight lasted 14.8 minutes.    Feb. 20, 1962:  John Glenn became the first American to circle the Earth, making three orbits in his  Friendship 7  Mercury spacecraft. Despite some problems with spacecraft¾Glenn flew parts of the last two orbits manually because of an autopilot failure and left his normally jettisoned retrorocket pack attached to his capsule during reentry because of a loose heat shield¾this flight was enormously successful. The public, more than celebrating the technological success, embraced Glenn as a personification of heroism and dignity. Among other engagements, Glenn addressed a joint session of Congress and participated in several ticker-tape parades around the country.    May 15-16, 1963:  The capstone of Project Mercury, the flight of  Faith 7 , took place on this date with the flight of astronaut L. Gordon Cooper, who circled the Earth 22 times in 34 hours.    Mar. 23, 1965:  Following two unoccupied test flights, the first operational mission of Project Gemini took place on March 23, 1965. Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom commanded the mission, with John W. Young, a Naval aviator chosen as an astronaut in 1962, accompanying him.    Jun. 3-7, 1965:  The second piloted Gemini mission, GT-4, stayed aloft for four days and astronaut Edward H. White II performed the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA) or spacewalk by an American.    Oct. 11-22, 1968:  The first piloted flight of the Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 7, and Saturn IB launch vehicle, this flight involved astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Jr., Donn F. Eisele, and Walter Cunningham who tested hardware in Earth orbit.    Dec. 21-27, 1968:  On December 21, 1968, Apollo 8 took off atop a Saturn V booster from the Kennedy Space Center with three astronauts aboard¾Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr., and William A. Anders¾for a historic mission to orbit the Moon. At first it was planned as a mission to test Apollo hardware in the relatively safe confines of low Earth orbit, but senior engineer George M. Low of the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Texas (renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973), and Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Manager at NASA headquarters, pressed for approval to make it a circumlunar flight. The advantages of this could be important, both in technical and scientific knowledge gained as well as in a public demonstration of what the U.S. could achieve. In the summer of 1968 Low broached the idea to Phillips, who then carried it to the administrator, and in November the agency reconfigured the mission for a lunar trip. After Apollo 8 made one and a half Earth orbits its third stage began a burn to put the spacecraft on a lunar trajectory. As it traveled outward the crew focused a portable television camera on Earth and for the first time humanity saw its home from afar, a tiny, lovely, and fragile ""blue marble"" hanging in the blackness of space. When it arrived at the Moon on Christmas Eve this image of Earth was even more strongly reinforced when the crew sent images of the planet back while reading the first part of the Bible¾""God created the heavens and the Earth, and the Earth was without form and void""¾before sending Christmas greetings to humanity. The next day they fired the boosters for a return flight and ""splashed down"" in the Pacific Ocean on December 27. It was an enormously significant accomplishment coming at a time when American society was in crisis over Vietnam, race relations, urban problems, and a host of other difficulties. And if only for a few moments the nation united as one to focus on this epochal event. Two more Apollo missions occurred before the climax of the program, but they did little more than confirm that the time had come for a lunar landing.    Jul. 16-24, 1969:  The first lunar landing mission, Apollo 11 lifted off on July 16, 1969, and after confirming that the hardware was working well began the three day trip to the Moon. At 4:18 p.m. EST on July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module¾with astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin¾landed on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Apollo command module. After checkout, Armstrong set foot on the surface, telling the millions of listeners that it was ""one small step for a man¾one giant leap for mankind."" Aldrin soon followed him out and the two plodded around the landing site in the 1/6 lunar gravity, planted an American flag but omitted claiming the land for the U.S. as had routinely been done during European exploration of the Americas, collected soil and rock samples, and set up some experiments. The next day they launched back to the Apollo capsule orbiting overhead and began the return trip to Earth, ""splashing down"" in the Pacific on July 24.    Apr. 11-17, 1970:  The flight of Apollo 13 was one of the near disasters of the Apollo flight program. At 56 hours into the flight, an oxygen tank in the Apollo service module ruptured and damaged several of the power, electrical, and life support systems. People throughout the world watched and waited and hoped as NASA personnel on the ground and the crew, well on their way to the Moon and with no way of returning until they went around it, worked together to find a way safely home. While NASA engineers quickly determined that sufficient air, water, and electricity did not exist in the Apollo capsule to sustain the three astronauts until they could return to Earth, they found that the Lunar Module¾a self-contained spacecraft unaffected by the accident¾could be used as a ""lifeboat"" to provide austere life support for the return trip. It was a close-run thing, but the crew returned safely on April 17, 1970. The near disaster served several important purposes for the civil space program¾especially prompting reconsideration of the propriety of the whole effort while also solidifying in the popular mind NASA's technological genius.    Jul. 26-Aug. 7, 1971:  The first of the longer, expedition-style lunar landing missions, Apollo 15 was the first to include the lunar rover to extend the range of the astronauts on the Moon. They brought back one of the prize artifacts of the Apollo program, a sample of ancient lunar crust called the ""Genesis Rock.""    Dec. 7-19, 1972:  Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions to the Moon, and the only one to include a scientist¾astronaut/geologist Harrison Schmitt¾as a member of the crew.    May 25-Jun. 22, 1973:  Following the launch of the orbital workshop, Skylab, on May 14, 1973, the Skylab 2 mission began. The workshop had developed technical problems due to vibrations during liftoff and the meteoroid shield¾designed also to shade Skylab's workshop from the Sun's rays¾ripped off, taking with it one of the spacecraft's two solar panels, and another piece wrapped around the other panel keeping it from properly deploying. In spite of this, the space station achieved a nearcircular orbit at the desired altitude of 270 miles. While NASA technicians worked on a solution to the problem, an intensive tenday period followed before the Skylab 2 crew launched to repair the workshop. After substantial repairs requiring extravehicular activity (EVA), including deployment of a parasol sunshade that cooled the inside temperatures to 75 degrees Fahrenheit, by June 4 the workshop was in full operation. In orbit the crew conducted solar astronomy and Earth resources experiments, medical studies, and five student experiments. This crew made 404 orbits, in the process making three EVAs totaling six hours and 20 minutes. The first group of astronauts returned to Earth on June 22, 1973, and two other Skylab missions followed.    Jul. 15-24, 1975:  The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was the first international human space flight, taking place at the height of the détente between the United States and the Soviet Union during the mid-1970s. It was specifically designed to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking systems for American and Soviet spacecraft, and to open the way for international space rescue as well as future joint missions. To carry out this mission existing American Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft were used. The Apollo spacecraft was nearly identical to the one that orbited the Moon and later carried astronauts to Skylab, while the Soyuz craft was the primary Soviet vehicle used for cosmonaut flight since its introduction in 1967. A universal docking module was designed and constructed by NASA to serve as an airlock and transfer corridor between the two craft. Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton took off from Kennedy Space Center on July 15, to meet the already orbiting Soyuz spacecraft. Some 45 hours later the two craft rendezvoused and docked, and then Apollo and Soyuz crews conducted a variety of experiments over a twoday period. After separation, the Apollo vehicle remained in space an additional six days while Soyuz returned to Earth approximately 43 hours after separation. The flight was more a symbol of the lessening of tensions between the two superpowers than a significant scientific endeavor, a sharp contrast with the competition for international prestige that had fueled much of the space activities of both nations since the late 1950s.    Apr. 12, 1981:  Astronauts John W. Young and Robert L. Crippen flew Space Shuttle  Columbia  on the first flight of the Space Transportation System (STS-1).  Columbia , which takes its name from three famous vessels including one of the first U.S. Navy ships to circumnavigate the globe, became the first airplane-like craft to land from orbit for reuse when it touched down at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California at approximately 10:21 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on April 14th after a flight of two days, six hours and almost 21 minutes. The mission also was the first to employ both liquid- and solid-propellant rocket engines for the launch of a spacecraft carrying humans.    Jun. 18, 1983:  Astronauts Robert L. Crippen and Frederick H. Hauck piloted Space Shuttle  Challenger  (STS-7) on a mission to launch two communications satellites and the reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS 01). Sally K. Ride, one of three mission specialists on the first Shuttle flight with five crewmembers, became the first American woman astronaut.  Challenger  was named after the H.M.S.  Challenger , an English research vessel operating from 1872 to 1876.    Aug. 30, 1983:  Astronauts Richard H. Truly and Daniel C. Brandenstein piloted Space Shuttle  Challenger  (STS-8) on another historic mission, carrying the first black American astronaut, Guion S. Bluford, into space as a mission specialist. The astronauts launched communications satellite Insat 1B into orbit.    Nov. 28, 1983:  Astronauts John W. Young and Brewster W. Shaw piloted Space Shuttle  Columbia  (STS-9) on a mission that carried the first non-U.S. astronaut to fly in the U.S. space program, West German Ulf Merbold.  Columbia  also transported Spacelab 1, the first flight of this laboratory in space, carrying more than 70 experiments in 5 areas of scientific research: astronomy and solar physics, space plasma physics, atmospheric physics and Earth observations, life sciences, and materials science.    Jan. 28, 1986:  The Space Shuttle  Challenger , STS-51L, was tragically destroyed and its crew of seven was killed, during its launch from the Kennedy Space Center about 11:40 a.m. The explosion occurred 73 seconds into the flight as a result of a leak in one of two Solid Rocket Boosters that ignited the main liquid fuel tank. The crewmembers of the  Challenger  represented a cross-section of the American population in terms of race, gender, geography, background, and religion. The explosion became one of the most significant events of the 1980s, as billions around the world saw the accident on television and empathized with any one of the several crewmembers killed. The disaster prompted a thorough review of the shuttle program and NASA overall, leading to substantive reforms in the management structure, safety program, and procedures of human spaceflight.    Apr. 24-29, 1990:  During the flight of the Space Shuttle  Discovery  (STS-31) the crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. Soon after deployment, controllers found that the telescope was flawed by a ""spherical aberration,"" a mirror defect only 1/25th the width of a human hair, that prevented Hubble from focusing all light to a single point. At first many believed that the spherical aberration would cripple the 43foot-long telescope, and NASA received considerable negative publicity, but soon scientists found a way with computer enhancement to work around the abnormality and engineers planned a servicing mission to fully correct it with an additional instrument. Even with the aberration, Hubble made many important astronomical discoveries, including striking images of galaxy M87, providing evidence of a potentially massive black hole.    Dec. 2-12, 1993:  Astronauts Richard O. Covey and Kenneth D. Bowersox piloted Space Shuttle  Endeavour  (STS-61) on a highly successful mission to service the optics of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and perform routine maintenance on the orbiting observatory. Following a precise and flawless rendezvous, grapple, and berthing of the telescope in the cargo bay of the Shuttle, the  Endeavour  flight crew, in concert with controllers at Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, and Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, completed all eleven planned servicing tasks during five extravehicular activities for full accomplishment of all STS-61 servicing objectives. This included installation of a new Wide Field & Planetary Camera and sets of corrective optics for all the other instruments, as well as replacement of faulty solar arrays, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and electrical components to restore the reliability of the observatory subsystem.  Endeavour  then provided HST with a reboost into a 321-nautical-mile, nearly circular orbit. Re-deployment of a healthy HST back into orbit using the shuttle robotic arm occurred at 5:26 a.m. EST on December 10th, and the telescope was once again a fully operational, free-flying spacecraft with vastly improved optics. Orbital verification of HST's improved capabilities occurred in early Jan., well ahead of the March schedule.  Endeavour , the newest of the orbiters, was named after the eighteenth century vessel captained by British explorer Capt. James Cook. The new Shuttle craft took its maiden voyage in May 1992.    Feb. 3-11, 1994:  Astronauts Charles F. Bolden and Kenneth S. Reightler, Jr., flew Space Shuttle  Discovery  (STS-60) on a historic mission featuring the first Russian cosmonaut to fly on a U.S. mission in space, Mission Specialist Sergei K. Krikalev, veteran of two lengthy stays aboard the Russian  Mir  Space Station. This mission underlined the newly inaugurated cooperation in space between Russia and the U.S., featuring Russia's becoming an international partner in the international space station effort involving the U.S. and its international partners.    Feb. 3-11, 1995:  Exactly one year after a major cooperative flight with the Russians in STS-60, NASA's Space Shuttle  Discovery , this time STS-63, flew another historic mission featuring the flyby of the Russian  Mir  Space Station. It also featured the first time that a woman pilot, Eileen M. Collins, flew the Space Shuttle.     For further information contact Roger D. Launius, NASA Chief Historian, rlaunius@codei.hq.nasa.gov"

Satellites operated by the  Commerce Department's   National       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  and by the Russian       government detected a distress signal from the 53-foot fishing       vessel  Mediterranean Sea II  Jan. 6. The crew was airlifted       by  Coast Guard   Search       and Rescue  teams.           The vessel, 50 miles southeast       of Cape Fear, had electrical and engine room fires, and was without       electricity and engine power in rough seas. A large wave hit       the bow of the ship and destroyed the windscreen on the bridge.       The vessel was taking on water.          The crew manually activated their       406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon ( EPIRB )       after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding       on the vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected       by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard.          ""While the cause of the       incident is not yet known, six lives were saved by the use of       properly working safety gear such as an EPIRB and lifejackets.       With the EPIRB, we were able to quickly find their location and       in this case able to save their lives,"" said LCDR Brendan       McPherson, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard  Atlantic       Area Command , headquartered in Portsmouth, Va.           When the Coast Guard received       the distress alert from NOAA, a search was started with air crews       from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., in an  HH-60 Jayhawk        helicopter, a  C-130       Hercules  aircraft and an  HH-65       Dolphin  helicopter from Coast Guard Air Facility Charleston,       S.C.           The first helicopter on scene       was the rescue helicopter from Air Facility Charleston finding       the  Mediterranean Sea II  almost completely submerged and       some fishermen jumping into the water. All of the fishermen were       wearing survival suits and Personal Flotation Devices. Three       fishermen were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to safety.                 The helicopter from Air Station       Elizabeth City arrived shortly and hoisted the three remaining       fishermen to safety from 10-15 foot seas, sustained winds of       25 mph, and gusts nearing 50 mph. The fishermen were taken to       North Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Airport, N.C., in good condition.                 The crew of the  Mediterranean       Sea II , homeported in Little River, S.C., said they are thankful       their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment       can mean the difference between life and death.           The Cospas-Sarsat system uses       a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits       to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft       in distress. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service represents the       United States in this program, providing satellite platforms       and ground equipment, and operating the  U.S.       Mission Control Center .           NOAA's Geostationary Operational       Environmental Satellites ( GOES )       can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites       in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth       from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission       Control Center at  NOAA's       National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service        in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around       the world. Today there are 30 countries participating in the       system. More than 12,000 lives have been saved worldwide since       the system became operational in 1982.          NOAA's National Environmental       Satellite, Data, and Information Service is the nation's primary       source of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellite       and Data Service operates the nation's  environmental       satellites , which are used for weather forecasting, climate       monitoring, and other environmental applications such as fire       detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements.

The vessel had sunk, and       the four people onboard were adrift in a life raft when a  Navy  helicopter from  Naval       Station Roosevelt Roads , Puerto Rico, came to their aid.       The four people were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken       to the Naval base.          As the vessel sank, its 406 MHz       emergency position-indicating radio beacon ( EPIRB )       was activated. The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system,       and NOAA notified the  Coast Guard .          The U.S. Coast Guard's Rescue       Sub-Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contacted all agencies in       the area requesting air support for a long-range offshore flight,       but no aircraft were immediately available. San Juan RSC then       contacted  Coast Guard District       7  in Miami for additional air support. A Coast Guard  C-130 Hercules        (CG1712) was airborne in the Windward Pass and was diverted to       the scene with about eight hours left of flight time. The aircraft       received a strong signal from the 121.5 MHz homer in the EPIRB,       and was able to home in on the life raft with the four persons       on board. The C-130 deployed a small survival pack to the stranded       sailors until they could be rescued.          San Juan RSC again contacted        Navy Helicopter Squadron VC-8        in Roosevelt Roads and was told that an  H-3       Search and Rescue helicopter  was now available. After a two       hour flight from Puerto Rico, the H-3 arrived on scene and hoisted       the four sailors from the life raft. None of the rescued were       reported to have any serious injuries. The cause of the sinking       is yet unknown, but weather conditions were reported to be less       than favorable with winds around 25 knots and four-to-five-foot       seas.          The crew of the sailing vessel       said they are thankful their emergency beacon saved the day.       In an emergency, the equipment can mean the difference between       life and death.          ""The Search and Rescue program       is truly an international humanitarian program,"" said Ajay       Mehta, manager of  NOAA's       Sarsat  program. ""This particular rescue illustrates       the international aspect of the program. The vessel was registered       with the United Kingdom and three of the people rescued were       from Great Britain, the fourth was from Spain. Yet, U.S. search       and rescue teams joined together to come to the aid of these       individuals.""            The Cospas-Sarsat system uses       a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits       to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft       in distress.  NOAA's National       Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service  represents       the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms       and ground equipment, and operating the  U.S.       Mission Control Center .          NOAA's  Geostationary       Operational Environmental Satellites  (GOES) can instantly       detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the       system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth from       pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission       Control Center at NOAA's Satellite and Data Service in Suitland,       Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world.       Today there are 35 countries participating in the system. More       than 13,000 lives have been saved worldwide since the system       became operational in 1982 and more than 4,500 in the United       States alone. September of this year marks the 20th anniversary       of the first Sarsat rescue.          NOAA's Satellite and Data Service       is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological       and climate data. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service operates       the nation's  environmental       satellites , which are used for weather forecasting, climate       monitoring, and other environmental applications such as fire       detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements.       NOAA's Satellite and Data Service also operates three  data       centers , which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography,       solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial       physics, and paleoclimatology.

The first landing                      opportunity was waved-off due to unacceptably high cross winds                      at the Shuttle Landing Facility. The landing occurred on KSC                      Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) runway 33. On this mission,                      STS-103, the orbiter and crew traveled over 3,267,000 miles.                                           End                      of mission elapsed times are:                                          Eastern                    Time Mission Elapse Time                                            Main                        Gear Touchdown 7:00:47 p.m. 7 days/23 hours/10 minutes/47                        seconds                        Nose                        Gear Touchdown 7:00:58 p.m. 7 days/23 hours/10 minutes/58                        seconds                        Wheels                        Stop 7:01:34 p.m. 7 days/23 hours/11 minutes/34 seconds                                                                                     Upon                      close inspection of the orbiter following touchdown, engineers                      noted that a black tile was missing on the right inboard elevon,                      next to the fuselage. The missing tile measures 9 inches by                      41/2 inches. No significant damage to the orbiter was found                      and the flight crew was never in any danger due to the missing                      tile. Initial indications are the tile came off sometime just                      prior to final approach. Further analysis will take place                      over the next several days once the orbiter is in the Orbiter                      Processing Facility.                      Tow                      to the OPF is scheduled to begin at about 12 midnight tonight.                      Once in the OPF, the Discovery's systems will be deserviced                      and vehicle safing will be conducted over the next two days.                      Discovery, as well the other two vehicles at KSC, will be                      powered-down for the remainder of the holidays. Normal vehicle                      processing is scheduled to commence Jan. 4.                      The                      seven-member astronaut crew will spend tonight in Florida.                      Tomorrow they are scheduled to depart at about 2:30 p.m. from                      Patrick Air Force Base for their homes in Houston, TX.                                          FLORIDA                      TODAY - December 27, 1999                     Discovery                      targets Kennedy Space Center landing                      By Robyn Suriano                                             CAPE                      CANAVERAL, Fla. - Their work done in space, shuttle Discovery's                      crew is due home tonight at Kennedy Space Center after successfully                      repairing the Hubble Space Telescope last week.                       The                      crew prepared Sunday for landing at 5:24 p.m. EST (2224 GMT)                      tonight. Weather looks good, but NASA will have its back-up                      landing site at Edwards Air Force Base in California ready                      just in case.                       Officials                      want the ship home today or Tuesday, so enough time is left                      to turn off its systems and secure the $2 billion spaceship                      inside a KSC hangar before year's end.                       Although                      they don't expect any problems, NASA wants its shuttles safely                      stored to avoid any Y2K computer glitches.                       As                      always, NASA prefers to land in Florida. So if weather is                      bad tonight, but promises to clear here Tuesday, NASA probably                      would keep the ship in space an extra day.                       ""Right                      now the weather looks good for them to land (tonight) at the                      Kennedy Space Center,"" said NASA spokeswoman Eileen Hawley                      at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""But Edwards will                      be fully supported in case we need it.""                       Launched                      Dec. 19, Discovery's crew captured the Hubble Space Telescope                      last week with the shuttle's robot arm so it could be placed                      inside the ship's cargo bay and fixed by spacewalking astronauts.                                            During                      three trips outside, astronauts repaired the observatory's                      broken pointing system and installed improved equipment to                      keep Hubble working until the next NASA visit in 2001.                       It                      temporarily had stopped taking images when the pointing system                      broke down in November.                       With                      its release back into orbit Christmas day, the $3-billion                      telescope could start work again around Jan. 9. Early checks                      show the telescope is working fine - much to the joy of anxious                      astronomers.                       ""It                      was a wonderful, incredibly successful mission,"" said Anne                      Kinney, who was among the Hubble scientists spending the holiday                      in Houston to monitor the mission. ""It was hard to miss Christmas,                      there's no doubt about that. People were missing their families,                      calling their families. But I don't think anybody would have                      been anywhere else.""

Frenchman                      Jean-Francois Clervoy used Discovery's robot arm to lift Hubble                      from the shuttle cargo bay and, as the spacecraft sped more                      than 370 miles above the South Pacific, gently let it go.                      The 43-foot telescope gleamed as it slowly drifted away against                      the backdrop of a blue, cloud-dotted Earth.                       ``Thanks                      for the great Christmas present,'' Mission Control told the                      astronauts. ``It's just what we wanted.''                       As                      Hubble moved out of sight, shuttle commander Curtis Brown                      Jr. noted the appropriateness of delivering Hubble back into                      orbit on Christmas. He wished everyone on planet Earth a merry                      Christmas and happy, healthy new millennium and so did his                      six crew members, in five languages.                       ``It                      is very special on Christmas Day that we're going to return                      Hubble back to the heavens and allow it to look at the stars                      like people did thousands and thousands of years ago,'' Brown                      said earlier in the day.                       Refurbished                      inside and out, the $3 billion telescope had been parked aboard                      the shuttle since Tuesday. Two teams of spacewalking mechanics                      spent three straight days replacing broken and outdated instruments.                      In all, they put in 13 boxes of gear worth close to $70 million.                                            ``What                      a Christmas for Hubble,'' exclaimed program manager John Campbell.                      ``Six gyros, new ones, not normally found under the tree.                      A new computer. Better batteries. Everybody needs batteries                      on Christmas. More storage. New clothes. Better fine guidance,                      and everybody needs better guidance on Christmas. And a new                      radio transmitter.''                       Astronomers                      can't wait to begin using the Hubble again. The first observations                      are expected in two weeks, ending a two-month hiatus, the                      longest ever for the 9-year-old observatory.                       Hubble's                      unparalleled eye to the universe closed on Nov. 13 following                      a series of gyroscope breakdowns. Without enough functioning                      gyroscopes, the telescope could not hold steady while focusing                      on stars, galaxies and other cosmic targets.                       The                      astronauts replaced all six gyroscopes during the first spacewalk                      and equipped each of the telescope's six batteries with voltage                      regulators to prevent overheating. Once the observatory was                      free of Discovery, the new gyroscopes took control, prompting                      cheers in orbit and Mission Control.                       ``It                      was a little bit of a sorry departure,'' astronaut John Grunsfeld                      told The Associated Press in an interview late Saturday. ``We                      felt like we could have stayed a little bit longer, learned                      a little bit more, and that's the way it goes. So we're just                      happy that everything went so well and that Hubble's on its                      way to start observing again.''                       Spacewalk                      2 had the crew replacing Hubble's 1970s-era computer with                      a faster, more powerful model and improving the telescope's                      aim with a new guidance unit. Spacewalk 3 saw the addition                      of a new radio transmitter, a top-of-the-line data recorder                      and large solar shades.                       Because                      of the rushed pace in orbit, the astronauts had little time                      to relax let alone celebrate Christmas -- until the third                      and final spacewalk ended late Friday.                       Santa                      appeared in Discovery's crew cabin, in red suit, cap and beard,                      to wish Merry Christmas to boys and girls everywhere, especially                      those in Houston.                       In                      a holiday call to Discovery, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin                      asked the seven astronauts if they had spotted Santa delivering                      presents. Brown said that although they were real busy, they                      caught a couple glimpses and even had a visit from the big                      guy himself.                       ``Well,                      he must have blessed you because that was one wonderful mission,''                      Goldin replied. ``Everyone on this planet is going to share                      the fruits of what you have done ... you've done all of us                      proud.''                       Discovery                      is due back on Earth on Monday. NASA cut the mission from                      10 to eight days and eliminated a fourth spacewalk in order                      to get the shuttle back in plenty of time before New Year's                      Eve, to avoid any potential Y2K computer problems.                                          Christmas,                      NASA-Style                       [One                      Hubble Girl’s Perspective]                       by                      Ann Jenkins                      In                      the perfect ending to a NASA-style Christmas, Hubble and Discovery                      thrilled their Houston team with a spectacular light show                      over NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Just two hours after releasing                      the telescope, Discovery streaked across the Houston sky with                      Hubble following close behind.                      From                      the lawn outside Mission Control, Discovery appeared as a                      brilliant light with a long, veil-like wake. Hubble trailed                      about eight miles behind, less bright but breathtaking nonetheless.                      About 20 of us stood in awe and gratitude as we savored this                      finale to an unforgettable Christmas Day.                      Earlier,                      the crew of Discovery gave us the best possible Christmas                      present by returning a healthy Hubble to duty. Now they soared                      overhead, treating us to a lovely Christmas light show as                      they released cabin water into the night sky. ""They’re                      flushing over us!"" someone joked. But as we admired the                      bride-veil effect created by the release, I was happy to have                      them flush over my head.                      In                      a moment it was over, and Discovery and Hubble disappeared                      into shadow. We stepped back into the Control Center just                      in time to serenade our orbiting heroes with NASA-fied versions                      of familiar Christmas carols. The first was to the tune of                      ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer""…with apologies to                      Rudolf:                     Hubble                      the Goddard payload                       Had                      a famous history,                       But                      with its broken gyros,                       Hubble                      really couldn’t see.                       All                      of the other telescopes                       They                      were junk if they broke down,                       But                      Hubble had one last hope,                       Astronauts                      from Houston town.                       Then                      one starry Christmas Day,                       103                      arrived,                       Steve                      and John and Mike and Claude,                       Curt                      and Scott, and Jean-Francois.

Space.com                      - December 25, 1999                     Discovery                      Returns Hubble to Duty: Astronomers Ecstatic                       By Glen Golightly                       Houston Bureau Chief                      HOUSTON                      - The once ailing Hubble Space Telescope soared away from                      space shuttle Discovery today - one step closer to being back                      in the science business.                      Flying                      370 miles above the Coral Sea, Discovery's crew released the                      telescope at 6:03 p.m. EST and began inching their spacecraft                      away, careful to avoid damaging or contaminating Hubble with                      the shuttle's maneuvering jets.                      Hubble's                      release followed three days of spacewalks to put the telescope                      back into operation.                      The                      process began at 3 p.m. EST when robot arm operator Jean-Franeois                      Clervoy grappled the 12.5-ton, 43.5-foot tall telescope. In                      short order, the telescope fired up under its own power as                      ground controllers ran tests.                      At                      4:05 p.m. EST, the three locks holding Hubble to Discovery                      were undone and Clervoy lifted the telescope up and slightly                      over Discovery's right side.                                                                                               ""What                            a Christmas for Hubble -- six gyros, new ones, not normally                            found under the tree.""                             Dr. John Campbell - Hubble Project Manager                                                                                        Ground                      controllers opened the telescope's aperture door about 5:15                      p.m. EST to ensure it operated properly while astronauts could                      still get to it.                      Michael                      Foale and Claude Nicollier stood by to make a spacewalk in                      case there were any problems in deployment.                      About                      6:03 p.m., Discovery's arm released the telescope and commander                      Curt Brown and pilot Scott Kelly inched the shuttle away from                      the telescope with a burst of the orbiter's thrusters. About                      20 minutes later, Discovery fired its maneuvering jets to                      move further away.                      ""Congratulations                      for an excellent deployment,"" said astronaut Stephen Robinson                      from mission control in Houston. ""Thanks for the great Christmas                      present -- just what we wanted.""                      A                      round of applause went up in mission control at 6:20 p.m.                      EST when telescope controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center                      in Greenbelt, MD, announced Hubble was operating well and                      pointing toward the sun to charge its batteries.                      The                      $3 billion dollar telescope had been out of commission since                      Nov. 15 when one of its three operating gyros failed. That                      changed the mission from routine repair to a rescue mission,                      but numerous delays pushed the October launch date into late                      December.                      Parting                      with the Hubble was sweet sorrow for astronomer and spacewalker                      John Grunsfeld, but he seemed satisfied with his work.                      ""It                      was a little bit of a sorry departure. We felt like we could                      have stayed a little bit longer, learned a little bit more                      and that's the way it goes,"" Grunsfeld said Saturday night.                      We're just happy everything went so well and that Hubble is                      on its way to start observing again.                      Following                      last minute technical delays, NASA launched Discovery on Dec.                      19, the last possible day to launch before mid-January. The                      space agency wanted the shuttle on the ground well before                      the year's end to avoid any computer glitches.                      During                      three spacewalks, astronauts replaced all six gyros, a guidance                      sensor and a radio transmitter. They also installed an improved                      computer, voltage regulators and data recorder. The scientific                      community seems to be excited about its large and improved                      Christmas present.                      ""It                      was hard to miss Christmas, I think there's no doubt about                      that, people were phoning their families and missing their                      families and so on,"" said Dr. Anne Kinney, a NASA astronomer.                      ""I don't anybody would have been anywhere else.""                      Dr.                      John Campbell, Hubble project manager, thought the telescope                      makes a dandy Christmas present.                      ""What                      a Christmas for Hubble -- six gyros, new ones, not normally                      found under the tree,"" he said with a grin. ""A new computer,                      better batteries, everybody needs batteries during Christmas,                      more storage, new clothes, better fine guidance and everybody                      needs better guidance and a new radio transmitter.""                      Hubble's                      new clothes are insulation blankets installed by spacewalkers.                      The 2001 mission to the telescope will finish the task.                      Earlier                      in the day, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin congratulated the                      crew and asked if they'd seen Santa while in orbit.                      Brown                      replied Santa had visited the orbiter.                      Goldin                      praised the crew and also took time to rebut space agency                      critics' charges that the mission was rushed and potentially                      unsafe.                      ""The                      other thing that gives me tremendous pride and pleasure is                      how conscientious the entire NASA team was about safety,""                      Goldin said. ""Never once did they worry about schedules and                      made sure that when the shuttle took off, it was in perfect                      condition.""                      Hubble                      could begin some observations in as little as two weeks if                      early tests go well. It should be back in full operation by                      sometime in March 2000.                      The                      space agency plans two more servicing missions to the telescope                      in 2001 and 2003. Hubble will possibly be returned to Earth                      in 2010 at the end of its mission by a space shuttle.                                         FLORIDA                      TODAY - December 25, 1999                                           Discovery crew spends their holiday in the heavens                       By Robyn Suriano                                             CAPE                      CANAVERAL - Shuttle Discovery's astronauts will see their                      loved ones today during video conferences from Earth to orbit.                      And the crew will float around the table together for their                      evening meal.                       But                      the Christmas trappings are few in space, where the astronauts                      will spend the holiday casting free the newly repaired Hubble                      Space Telescope.                       It's                      the final task of their 8-day mission, which included three                      spacewalks to fix Hubble's broken pointing system and make                      other improvements. The last walk wrapped up late Friday.                                            Their                      work done, the crew is to use Discovery's robot arm to release                      Hubble into orbit around 6 p.m. tonight, then head for a Monday                      landing at Kennedy Space Center and belated holiday celebrations.                                            Shhh                      - don't tell him, but astronaut Mike Foale will get some gifts                      here in Florida, when wife Rhonda and their two children congratulate                      him for giving Hubble a new computer brain on a spacewalk.                                            ""We                      miss him, and whenever we're having fun, the kids say, `I                      wish Daddy was here,' but they understand he's doing something                      important,'' said Rhonda Foale at home in Houston. ""They know                      he'll be back soon, and we'll have another Christmas dinner                      then.''                       Discovery's                      crew is only the third American mission in space for Christmas                      in NASA history.                       The                      Apollo 8 crew celebrated the 1968 holiday in orbit around                      the moon, and three astronauts spent Christmas 1973 on NASA's                      Skylab space station.                       This                      time, the agency didn't expect Discovery to be in space for                      the holiday, but repeated launch delays pushed the mission                      into Christmas week.                       Because                      the ship had been packed and closed for flight long before,                      NASA officials say they didn't send along a special holiday                      meal or tuck away little gifts for the hard-working crew.                                            That's                      why it will be all business in space, where astronauts Steve                      Smith and John Grunsfeld made the flight's last walk Friday.                      The Christmas Eve excursion included work on a radio transmitter                      and data recorder.                       ""Oh                      John, another beautiful day outside,"" Smith said when he popped                      open the hatch leading into Discovery's cargo bay. ""Look at                      that Earth, beautiful.""                       Their                      work ended late Friday, after they replaced a broken radio                      transmitter, installed an advanced data recorder and applied                      two new metal sheets of insulation over areas of Hubble.                                          Christmas                      Eve with the Hubble Family                      [One Hubble Girl’s Perspective]                      by Ann Jenkins                     ‘Twas                      the night before Christmas and here we are in Houston, more                      than a thousand miles from our homes and families and anything                      resembling a normal Christmas Eve. We’re the Hubble team from                      NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., but                      for now, we’re living here in Houston, working at Johnson                      Space Center, supporting the STS-103 mission. And Christmas                      just happens to fall in the middle of this very important                      visit to our beloved telescope.                     Our                      families try to understand why this is so important to us,                      why we need to be away during the holidays. We fight to stay                      focused and philosophical, but the truth is, as Christmas                      looms, we’re all feeling the pangs of separation.                      But                      thankfully, we’re together—our little Hubble family—and most                      of us have been for a very long time. Many have worked all                      three Hubble servicing missions. Ours is not a 9-to-5 job,                      especially in the months leading up to launch. We’ve been                      through a lot together, and we’ve grown close because of it.                      Some of us know each other so well we swear we’re becoming                      telepathic.                      On                      the East Coast, it’s already Christmas now. Kevin, who sits                      to my left, has three little ones whose pictures he’s pasted                      all over his console. He talks about them constantly, but                      he won’t be seeing them on Christmas Day. Maureen, Colleen                      and Mindy are apart from their children, too. Come to think                      of it, many teammates have kids back home. But these parents                      truly believe that this mission will benefit not only their                      children and grandchildren, but also generations beyond. This                      is their Christmas gift to humanity.                      I                      look around the room and search for words to describe this                      group. Dedicated…passionate…brilliant…creative…yes, that’s                      all true—but also so much more. We are a family.                     Tonight,                      after NASA declared mission success and guided Santa into                      Houston, we shared Christmas dinner together here in Mission                      Control. Though I can’t be with my own family tonight, I feel                      very privileged to break bread with this group—a close-knit,                      loyal clan bound not by blood but by vision.                     Merry                      Christmas from Houston.                                           FloridaToday,                    Friday, December 24, 1999                      Update                      for 7:35 p.m. EST                                                                                                                                                                                NEWS FLASH                            NASA's Santa Control has confirmed the jolly old elf                            made a touchdown in the greater Houston area. The image                            at left shows his approach to JSC. Control reports Santa                            has delivered his presents and then took off again on                            a trajectory over the Gulf of Mexico, presumably to                            a visit at Cape Canaveral. Of course, your home may                            be next.                                                                                                                     Update                      for 7:30 p.m. EST                                            Discovery is in daylight now, flying over Australia with its                      tail first, nearly at the end of orbit number 75.                                            The spacewalk is expected to last another two hours or so.                      The next task is to install the new insulation.                                            Mission commentator Kyle Herring just plugged the fact that                      Houston is about to have an opportunity to see Discovery and                      Hubble fly overhead within the hour.                                            Herring said that NASA's Web site for information about the                      possibility of seeing the shuttle in your area is located                      at  http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings .                        Update                      for 7 p.m. EST                                            The new recorder is being checked by flight controllers on                      the ground and the door to the area is being closed and latched                      with six bolts.                                            Next up is to install some new insulation on the outer skin                      of Hubble, replacing some insulation that has torn and peeled                      through the nine-and-a-half years that the observatory has                      been in orbit.                                            If it could all get done, the astronauts would like to cover                      six bays with the new insulation. They will do the first two                      and then Mission Control will decide what to do next based                      on how long they take to do the first pair.                                            The spacewalk can only last about seven hours and they need                      about one hour to do the final clean up in the cargo bay since                      the bay must be configured for landing.                        Update                      for 6:30 p.m. EST                                            Grunsfeld has the new recorder in place and has bolted it                      into place. A few feet lower on the telescope, Smith is installing                      devices that will allow the two spacewalkers to install new                      insulation on the outer skin of Hubble later tonight.                                            They have just passed into night again and there are no reports                      yet of spotting Santa Claus from space, although Santa was                      seen earlier today on NASA TV in Mission Control in Houston.                        Update                      for 6:20 p.m. EST                                            Grunsfeld is still in the foot restraint on the end of the                      robot arm and has just handed off the old data recorder to                      Smith. The new recorder is in Grunsfeld's hands and he is                      being moved back up to the telescope to install the new device.                                            The spacewalk has just passed the four-hour mark.                        Update                      for 6 p.m. EST                                            The spacewalking astronauts have finished installing a new                      radio transmitter and have moved on to the process of installing                      a new solid-state data recorder for the telescope. The 25-pound                      device replaces an old-fashioned reel-to-reel tape recorder.                        Update                      for 4:30 p.m. EST                                            John Grunsfeld is working diligently to remove a series of                      connectors on a failed radio transmitter. The coaxial cables                      are a little thinner than the ones you might connect to the                      back of your TV or VCR but they have the same kind of end.                                            Anyone who has had difficulty connecting these cables to your                      home electronics might only begin to imagine what it would                      be like to try to connect these same type of connectors to                      a device in the weightless space environment, while wearing                      oven mitts!                                            Grunsfeld does have some tools to help him, and it sounds                      like it's going very well, but the fact is that this is one                      of the few devices on Hubble that was not designed from the                      beginning to be serviced by spacewalking astronauts.                                            Smith continues to free float, assisting Grunsfeld as needed                      and also making inspections of Hubble.                                            This work should continue for about an hour.                                            Our next report will come about 5:45 p.m. EST if all goes                      well. If any serious problems arise we will update the site                      immediately.                        Update                      for 4:05 p.m. EST                                            Mission Control reports that with the successful test of the                      OCE package the crew of mission STS-103 has now effectively                      completed all of the major goals for this mission from the                      viewpoint of the Hubble Space Telescope community. The mission                      itself won't be a success, of course, until Discovery's crew                      is safely back on Earth next Monday.                        Update                      for 4 p.m. EST                                            Mission Control reports that the first repair task today was                      successful after the new Optical Control Electronics package                      passed its alivness test.                                            Grunsfeld is still on the robot arm and Smith is free floating.                      They have moved to a position more on the front of the telescope                      as seen from the flight deck windows, where they are about                      to replace a radio transmitter that failed in 1998.                                            As usual the work involves opening a door, removing electrical                      and mechanical attachments for the old unit, installing the                      new, taking some pictures of their work and then closing the                      doors again. This task should take about an hour-and-a-half.                                            There was some discussion about taking a few minutes to install                      some hand rail protective covers on the telescope but Mission                      Control asked the crew to press on with the planned tasks                      for today.                                            Note: we now have 10 images on our  Space                      Today  page.                        Update                      for 3:30 p.m. EST                                            Smith and Grunsfeld are mating the electrical connectors to                      the new Optical Control Electronics package that is part of                      the system Hubble needs to accurately point while stargazing.                                            The effort is going very well and you can tell that this is                      the second spacewalk of the mission for both men as they are                      more talkative, in good humor and clearly enjoying their time                      out in the cargo bay.                                            At this point we will begin updating this Web site about every                      half-hour, with a longer break at 5 p.m. while I attend my                      children's Christmas program at church. FLORIDA TODAY's senior                      aerospace writer Robyn Suriano will be monitoring the spacewalk                      and we'll update the site immediately if anything seriously                      goes wrong.                        Update                      for 3:20 p.m. EST                                            Mission Control has given the astronauts a go for the first                      task today, which is to install some new electronics into                      the telescope that will help the Fine Guidance Sensor.                                            The work area is fairly high up on the telescope. Smith is                      free floating and climbed up the telescope himself, with Mike                      Foale from the inside of Discovery reminding him to stay tethered                      to Hubble at all times.                                            Grunsfeld, on the other hand, had to request a ride on the                      end of the arm, asking Jean-Francois Clervoy to ""beam me up!""                      Grunsfeld said.                        ""Beaming                      you up,"" Clervoy replied.                                            This work area is more ""behind"" the telescope than the other                      areas and very near the solar arrays. The spacewalkers outside                      and Mike Foale directing things from the inside are constantly                      reminding each other not to lean back.                                            At 3:17 p.m. the spacewalkers had the door to the Bay C area                      open and were about to tether the door open and begin removing                      electrical connectors on the old piece of equipment.                        Update                      for 3 p.m. EST                                            Daily set up was officially complete at 2:58 p.m. EST.                                            Grunsfeld is in the foot restraint at the end of the robot                      arm on the foot restraint. Since he is wearing Mike Foale's                      top half of the spacesuit parts of his upper suit has a broken                      red stripe on it.                                            Meanwhile, Mission Control reports that the portable foot                      restraint that kept flopping around yesterday because of a                      stuck foot switch will not be used today. A second device                      will be used instead.                                            At the end of the spacewalk the balky platform will be attached                      and secured in the cargo bay as planned for the landing.                                            Also, just a minute ago a robot arm TV camera pointed down                      on Florida. We waved out the window and captured the image,                      which we'll post online in a few minutes. Consider it a Christmas                      wave from Space Online via NASA TV.                        Update                      for 2:45 p.m. EST                                            Both men can now be seen on NASA TV outside in the cargo bay.                                            Steve Smith has worked his way down to the area where Hubble                      is attached to the cargo bay. John Grunsfeld is still working                      at the airlock in and around the robot arm.                                            Once again, Smith's suit has a solid red stripe, while Grunsfeld's                      suit has no markings.                                            For the record - I think I finally have it straight - the                      idea of marking the spacesuits to tell the difference between                      astronauts was to begin with the Apollo 13 mission with red                      markings on Jim Lovell's suit. But we never saw those pictures                      on the moon following the mission's abort.                                            During the July 1969 Apollo 11 mission you couldn't tell the                      difference between Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. By the                      time the idea was presented to mark the suits it was too late                      for Apollo 12's mission in November 1969 with Pete Conrad                      and Alan Bean. (Not that it really mattered because of the                      lack of TV coverage of the moonwalk after the failure of the                      TV camera.)                                            Apollo 14's Alan Shepard was the first to be seen on the Moon                      wearing a suit marked in red.                        Update                      for 2:35 p.m. EST                                            Routine set up chores are in work right now, including retriving                      tools from the airlock to attach to the mini work station                      on the shuttle's robot arm and installing what is essentially                      another leg for the ring platform holding Hubble in the cargo                      bay.                                            The first major task will be to install some new electronics                      that will help the Fine Guidance Sensors do a better job in                      helping point Hubble while it makes its science observations.                        Update                      for 2:30 p.m. EST                                            Steve Smith is now outside the shuttle's airlock, floating                      in the cargo bay. He left just about three minutes ago.                        ""Ah,                      John, another beautiful day outside."" Smith said after popping                      open the thermal cover to the outside hatch. ""Oh look at that                      Earth, beautiful.""                                            During final suit checks read off by Smith, he reported his                      suit remaining time as seven hours and 48 minutes, 97 percent                      power and 99 percent oxygen. Suit had 18.1 volts DC and 3.4                      amps.                                            I did not copy Grunsfeld's report.                        Update                      for 2:17 p.m. EST                                            With no radio traffic or mission control commentary describing                      the airlock depressurization, Mike Foale performed a radio                      check and then the next thing you know Smith and Grunsfeld                      were on their batteries, officially beginning this third spacewalk                      at 2:17 p.m EST, according to my clock.                                            The airlock is depressurized, the hatch is open and the two                      spacewalkers are just about ready to float outside.                        Update                      for 2:10 p.m. EST                                            The lead Orbit 1 flight control team have taken charge in                      the Mission Control Center. That means that Linda Hamm is                      the flight director, astronaut Steve Robinson is the CAPCOM                      and mission commentator is Kyle Herring.                                            Among the goals for today's spacewalk: replace a recorder,                      install some new electronics and add some new layers of insulation                      to the outer skin of Hubble.                        Update                      for 2 p.m. EST                                            Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld are inside Discovery's airlock                      pre-breathing pure oxygen to rid their bloodstreams of any                      nitrogen, to avoid getting the bends when they expose their                      bodies to the lower air pressure inside their spacesuits.                        Update                      for 1 p.m. EST                                            Mission Control reports that Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld                      are right on the timeline preparing for today's spacewalk                      and will likely begin their adventure at 2:20 p.m. EST. The                      spacewalk is expected to last about seven-and-a-half hours.                                            There are no problems reported with the new suit that John                      Grunsfeld will wear today. The one he wore during Wednesday's                      spacewalk would not power up properly today, so he is going                      to wear the spacesuit that Mike Foale wore yesterday.                                            Once the two men are outside we will provide updates to this                      page every 30 minutes.                        Update                      for 12:30 p.m. EST                                            Preparations today for the third spacewalk ran into a minor                      hitch this morning in that one of the spacesuits power system                      wouldn't properly work, forcing a last-minute change to use                      a back up spacesuit instead.                                            The Extravehicular Mobility Units - spacesuits - come in two                      major pieces, the top and the bottom. Both the tops and the                      bottoms come in standard sizes, which can be somewhat adjusted                      for a particular astronaut. Long gone are the days when an                      astronauts spacesuit was sized just for him.                                            Haven't heard an exact time yet when the crew thinks they                      can begin the spacewalk today. We'll pass that along as soon                      as we hear.                                           Thursday,                      December 23, 1999                     Update                      for 10:30 p.m. EST                                             The Orbit 2 flight team has taken over at Mission Control.                      The two spacewalkers are still in the airlock, which is repressurizing                      now. Everything sounds like things are going well with the                      crew.                                            Mission Commentator Kyle Herring reports the official spacewalk                      start time was 2:06 p.m. EST and the official stop time was                      10:16 p.m. EST, making the official spacewalk duration of                      eight hours and 10 minutes.                                            Still the third longest spacewalk in program history.                                            I'll make a brief but meaningless observation that I stopped                      my timer when I heard Foale report they had gone off battery                      power, which was precisely five minutes sooner than the official                      time. Nothing to lose sleep over.                                            Which sounds like a good idea right about now.                                            Tomorrow is Christmas Eve and there is a third spacewalk planned.

Good night from Cape Canaveral.                                            - Jim Banke                        Update                      for 10:15 p.m. EST                                            Mike Foale could be seen on NASA TV entering the airlock at                      10:03 p.m EST and shutting the thermal cover for the outer                      airlock hatch behind him.                                            The hatch was closed by Foale at 10:07 p.m. EST.                                            Nicollier and Foale went off suit battery power (unofficially                      based on my clock) at 10:11 p.m. making this spacewalk eight                      hours and five minutes long, the third-longest spacewalk in                      U.S. space history.                                            The second longest was completed yesterday at eight hours                      and 15 minutes, while the longest was in May 1992 aboard shuttle                      Endeavour at eight hours and 29 minutes.                                            Discovery's cargo bay is now empty of any astronauts, but                      the Hubble Space Telescope remains on its pedestal with a                      new computer brain and a new Fine Guidance Sensor thanks to                      today's spacewalk.                        Update                      for 10 p.m. EST                                            The two spacewalkers are stuffing the airlock with some of                      their tools, as well as the balky portable foot restraint.                      Nicollier entered the airlock at 9:54 p.m. EST and it appears                      he's inside to stay.                                            Foale is still outside, but right at the airlock's entrance                      stowing his tethers.                        Update                      for 9:45 p.m. EST                                            At 9:37 p.m. Mike Foale's spacesuit sent him an alarm saying                      his suit is running low on battery power. The spacewalk was                      seven hours and 31 minutes long at that point.                                            Anticipating the suit warning, CAPCOM Steve Robinson radioed                      to Foale a moment earlier that when Foale heard the alarm                      he could ignore it because at that point Foale still had another                      90 minutes of power. At the beginning of the spacewalk, when                      Foale read aloud his suit status, he said he was good for                      seven hours and 59 minutes.                                            Mission Control says the pair of spacewalkers should be inside                      and off the suit power in about 20 minutes, making their spacewalk                      duration about eight hours. Both men are now in the vicinity                      of the airlock.                        Update                      for 9:30 p.m. EST                                            During the clean up operation Foale attached the portable                      foot restraint to its storage place and then discovered a                      problem.                                            Although the pin holding the device to the shuttle was secure,                      the platform itself would not stop from flopping around -                      apparently a problem with a switch that allows the astronauts                      to move the platform back and forth in a pitching motion while                      their feet are locked in place.                                            Mission Control has decided the crew should bring the platform                      inside, despite its relative bulkiness, and let them troubleshoot                      the problem overnight.                                            The platform will have to come back out tomorrow, possibly                      to be used, although there is a second portable foot restraint                      device on board.                                            The safety concern is that mission managers do not want the                      device flopping around during the landing, so they are going                      to figure out the best way to tether it in place in the cargo                      bay if the switch cannot be fixed.                        Update                      for 9:15 p.m. EST                                            Clean up work continues in the cargo bay.                                            Nicollier is still on the foot restraint at the end of the                      robot arm, suspended in the middle of the cargo bay and working                      on his mini-work station.                                            Foale is behind him, next to the equipment storage boxes near                      the base of the telescope.                                            Note: Earlier I wrote that Nicollier had been present for                      the five Hubble spacewalks in 1997. I actually wrote 1993,                      which is correct, but a solar flare must have bit-flipped                      the number to 1997 when I uploaded. I've corrected the earlier                      entry and thanks for the e-mail from several European friends.                                            - Jim Banke                        Update                      for 9 p.m. EST                                            The old Fine Guidance Sensor has been placed in its hold in                      the cargo bay, strapped into place and the door to the box                      shut according to what we can see on NASA TV at this time.                        Update                      for 8:50 p.m. EST                                            The thinking is that with the clean up work still to do and                      the remaining suit time available to the two crewmen it wasn't                      a good idea to try anything else tonight.                                            Now six hours and 44 minutes into the spacewalk.                        Update                      for 8:45 p.m. EST                                            Shuttle Discovery's crew has politely asked to do some more                      work outside today, but Mission Control politely said no thanks.                                            As a result the spacewalkers will be cleaning up and moving                      inside within the hour.                        Update                      for 8:30 p.m. EST                                            The doors to the Fine Guidance Sensor are closed and Nicollier                      is driving the three bolts to latch the doors shut.                                            Meanwhile, Hubble flight controllers report the new Fine Guidance                      Sensor has passed its initial aliveness test, meaning they                      are able to see electrical power and data commands go through                      the unit.                                            The view from NASA TV right now shows the shuttle approaching                      sunrise, with a bright blue horizon in the background as the                      crew works in the dark. Truly incredible.                        Update                      for 8:15 p.m. EST                                            The newly installed Fine Guidance Sensor is ready for its                      aliveness test after all eight connections were mated by the                      two spacewalkers and the work to load the new unit into place                      was declared done.                                            After the initial trouble sliding the nearly 500-pound box                      into place, CAPCOM Steve Robinson from Mission Control congratulated                      the crew saying: ""Great work, persistence pays.""                                            The two spacewalkers are now taking detailed pictures of their                      work with the new sensor unit. Next step will be to close                      the doors to the work area.                                          FLORIDA                      TODAY - December 24, 1999                     Santa                      to check out new vehicle hangar at shuttle runway                       Sleigh                      commander considers hangar rest stop for next year                       A Kennedy Space Center traditional holiday news release                                         The                      Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) is preparing                      for a visitor on Christmas Eve. Rumors are strong that Santa                      Claus may fly by the landing strip to check on the progress                      of the $8 million Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Support Complex                      currently under construction.                        The                      groundbreaking took place on Dec. 18, 1998, just before Santa's                      visit last year. The sweeping curve of the facility's roof                      is plainly visible now to the center's employees from State                      Road 3.                       Located                      on the tow-way at the south end of the SLF, the complex will                      include a multi-purpose RLV hangar and adjacent facilities                      for related ground support equipment and administrative/technical                      support. Intended to support the Space Shuttle and other RLV                      and X-vehicles, the new complex is jointly funded by NASA's                      Space Shuttle Program, KSC and the Spaceport Florida Authority.                      The complex is scheduled for completion by mid-2000, in time                      to support possible test flights of the X-34 RLV technology                      demonstrator and other future vehicles.                       Santa                      is particularly interested in anything that has to do with                      reusable launch vehicles since, technically, his sleigh falls                      into that category of transportation. It has been upgraded                      with state-of-the-art precision landing equipment compatible                      with the Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) system and Microwave                      Scanning Beam Landing System (MSBLSS) in place at the runway                      for use during Space Shuttle landings. However, Santa still                      relies on the tried-and-true reindeer propulsion system he                      has always used to deliver presents to good children worldwide                      every holiday season.                       These                      automated landing systems will be left on in the automatic                      mode at both the SLF and the Skid Strip at Cape Canaveral                      Air Station when the facilities close down for the holidays.                      ""No government expense is involved in leaving these landing                      strips ready to support any emergency Santa may experience                      while in the Central Florida area,"" said Bill Plutt, the Airfield                      Services Manager for Space Gateway Support. ""We're glad to                      continue this tradition that started shortly after the opening                      of the SLF in the 1970s.""                       Special                      care will be taken to inspect the runway prior to Discovery's                      planned landing on Dec. 27 at the conclusion of STS-103, the                      third Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. Although it                      has never been confirmed that Santa has made a pit stop at                      KSC, a routine sweep of the runway to remove debris after                      the holidays last year produced one defective sleigh bell,                      some tattered red ribbon, and a pile of what appeared to be                      cookie crumbs.                                          FLORIDA                      TODAY - December 23, 1999                     Hubble's                      return to science duty assured thanks to Discovery                       By                      Robyn Suriano                                         CAPE                      CANAVERAL - NASA's Hubble Space Telescope can look into the                      universe's deepest corners once again, thanks to two spacewalking                      repairmen who fixed the observatory Wednesday.                      Astronauts                      Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld rejuvenated the telescope's                      broken pointing system during an eight-hour spacewalk from                      shuttle Discovery's cargo bay.                       Working                      steadily while the shuttle flew 360 miles above Earth, the                      men replaced equipment that directs the telescope's powerful                      eye toward black holes, galaxies and other targets.                       ""Absolutely                      fantastic job today,"" astronaut Steve Robinson told the crew                      from Mission Control at Johnson Space Center in Houston. ""We're                      very pleased with everything you've done. You deserve a good                      rest tonight.""                       Their                      successful work clears the way for more walks today and Friday.                                            But                      the first excursion Wednesday was critical to get Hubble working                      again after equipment broke down Nov. 13 and forced the telescope                      to halt all science activities.                       Now                      if all goes as expected, the telescope could resume taking                      images in mid-January.                       Smith                      and Grunsfeld's handiwork started shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday,                      when they floated outside in their spacesuits.                       Smith                      made three previous walks on NASA's last mission to Hubble                      in 1997. Grunsfeld was making his spacewalk debut.                       ""Ready?""                      Smith asked his partner before heading out, ""Hubble needs                      us.""                       ""Wow,""                      Grunsfeld replied as he emerged to his first view of Earth                      from outside. He then saw the four-story telescope towering                      overhead. ""That is one beautiful telescope,"" he said.                       The                      men had little time to sightsee, however.                       Smith                      immediately floated over to inspect Hubble. During NASA's                      1997 visit to the telescope, astronauts found tattered areas                      where the harsh environment of space had damaged the observatory's                      skin.                       To                      help, the astronauts created makeshift insulation blankets                      and tacked them over the worst regions.                       Smith                      found the bandages still in place and reported that the telescope's                      skin seemed to be holding up.                       ""I                      don't see any peeling or flaking,"" he reported while floating                      along the telescope. ""Looks good.""                       The                      men then began replacing three toaster-sized boxes holding                      devices called gyroscopes that help Hubble point toward its                      targets.                       Smith                      worked from a footstand mounted on the telescope's exterior,                      while Grunsfeld was attached by his feet to the end of Discovery's                      50-foot robot arm.                       Inside                      the ship, French astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy guided the                      arm with the help of cameras and views out the shuttle's windows.                      Astronaut Mike Foale oversaw his crewmates' work from indoors.                                            Swallowed                      almost completely inside Hubble, Smith replaced two boxes                      in delicate work that brought him very close to sensitive                      instruments.                       When                      television views were available from space, NASA officials                      watched over Smith's shoulder from a camera mounted on the                      robot arm.                       ""He's                      really buried inside the telescope right now,"" said astronaut                      Joe Tanner, a former Hubble spacewalker who followed the work                      from Mission Control. ""It really helps (Smith) to have long                      arms.""                       The                      tallest of Discovery's crew members at 6 feet, ¾ inches, Smith                      was chosen to do the work inside Hubble because of his long                      reach.                       ""Watch                      your arm there, Steve,"" Foale told the astronaut at one point                      when Smith got close to equipment.                       ""That's                      the number one thing on my mind,"" Smith replied.                       With                      Grunsfeld's help, Smith deftly changed two of the broken units                      before his partner took over and replaced the third. The main                      job was done by 6 p.m.                       Each                      box holds two gyroscopes, and controllers on Earth reported                      that all six devices showed early signs of working well.                       The                      men then turned to a Hubble instrument that detects infrared                      radiation emitted from stars and other objects. After much                      effort, they opened tightly closed valves on the instrument                      to release pent-up gases inside.                       Not                      critical, the work nonetheless will help other spacewalkers                      when they make improvements to the instrument on a future                      Hubble mission.                       The                      sticky valves took more time than expected, however, and made                      the pair late for work on Hubble's six batteries.                       Grunsfeld                      worked efficiently however, and outfitted each battery with                      equipment that will keep them from overheating when they're                      being charged. Now a decade old, the batteries are growing                      sensitive.                       Their                      jobs finished for the night, the men stored their tools and                      returned to the shuttle around 9:45 p.m. The walk's official                      time clocked out at 8 hours, 15 minutes.                       It                      was the second longest NASA spacewalk ever, next to an 8-hour,                      29-minute excursion by three astronauts in May 1992 to retrieve                      a stranded satellite.                       Overall,                      the walk flowed smoothly to the delight of Hubble scientists,                      who watch any work on the telescope with dread and excitement.                                            It's                      hard for them to see their prized, $3-billion observatory                      with its insides exposed and astronauts floating around it.                      One wrong move and the telescope could be damaged.                       ""You                      watch with your heart in your mouth,"" said Hubble scientist                      Anne Kinney, speaking before the mission launched. ""People                      live and breathe this stuff. It really means a lot to us.""                                            Discovery's                      mission is NASA's third trip to Hubble, which was launched                      from the same spaceship in 1990. It unknowingly was built                      with a bad mirror that left its vision uselessly blurry.                       The                      problem was fixed in 1993 by the first crew to visit Hubble,                      and a second group returned to improve the observatory in                      1997. After Discovery's current flight, future voyages are                      booked in 2001 and 2003.                       NASA                      thinks Hubble can work through 2010, when it could be brought                      back to Earth and displayed at a museum such as the Smithsonian's                      National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.                       During                      the remaining spacewalks, Discovery's crew is to give Hubble                      an advanced computer brain and spread new insulation over                      parts of the telescope. The crew would set Hubble free again                      Christmas day and return to Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 27.                                            NASA                      wants the shuttle home before year's end to avoid any potential                      Y2K computer problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Astronauts                            Steve Smith (with the red stripes) and John Grunsfeld                            working outside in the cargo bay on Wednesday during                            the first of three planned spacewalks.                                                                                                                                Space.com                      - December 22, 1999                     Ballet                      in Space: How to Be a Hubble Spacewalker                      By Andrew Chaikin                     You're                      floating in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Discovery,                      365 miles above the Earth. Before you, anchored in a special                      mounting, is the Hubble Space Telescope. Your mission, simply                      stated, is to fix it. In other words, you have been assigned                      one of the most demanding jobs ever given to an astronaut.                     Fortunately,                      you're working on a satellite designed to be serviced in space                      by astronauts. Hubble is outfitted with handholds for the                      spacewalkers to grab onto. And its components are relatively                      accessible, by opening special access doors. But that doesn't                      mean your orbital repair job is easy. First off, you're working                      in a pressurized space suit. And if you want to know what                      that's like, just ask Story Musgrave, one of the four spacewalkers                      on the first Hubble repair mission in 1993.                     The                      Woes of Working in a Space Suit                      ""Suits                      are hard,"" Musgrave says. ""They're just miserable. Because                      they're so stiff."" Shuttle space suits are filled with oxygen                      at a pressure of 4.3 pounds per square inch. That gives the                      spacewalker enough oxygen to breathe -- but it also makes                      the suit about as flexible as a balloon in a Thanksgiving-day                      parade.                     For                      that reason, Musgrave was fussier than the finest tailor about                      the fit of his space suit. To bend at the waist, for example,                      he would need as much leverage as possible. To achieve this,                      Musgrave knew, his feet and shoulders would have to make firm                      contact with the suit itself. He also knew that during a six-hour                      spacewalk, being inside a tight-fitting suit would compress                      his spine -- which meant the suit had to be even tighter at                      the start of the day. ""I wear a very, very, very tight suit,""                      Musgrave says.                                           Musgrave wriggles into his spacesuit                     Musgrave                      paid special attention to the fit of his gloves. Before the                      flight, he says, ""I spent two hours 'tuning' my gloves. I                      tune every finger."" That meant having more pressure on his                      fingertips and less at the places between the fingers. It                      meant precisely adjusting the length of each finger of each                      glove, so that the glove's joints would coincide with those                      of his fingers.                                            ""You learn a new body.""                     Even                      after you have your space suit perfectly adjusted, Musgrave                      says, don't expect it to feel like a second skin. ""You learn                      a new body. You acquire a new arm. It's not your arm. It's                      not the suit arm. It's the combination of your arm and the                      suit arm. The suit does not have the same joints you have,                      and so you have to learn appropriately.""                      Musgrave                      says a prospective spacewalker has to relearn even simple                      motions -- for example, grabbing a floating tool. ""If you                      think you're going to get into a suit and reach out for something,                      you're going to miss it,"" he says, unless you practice it                      beforehand.                     That's                      just what Musgrave did -- hour upon hour of practice, using                      a number of methods. First, he did ""walk-throughs"", wearing                      normal clothes, with engineers who helped design the Hubble                      instruments right there, to answer any questions.                     Musgrave                      also practiced on something called the air-bearing table:                      picture him perched a special platform that rides across an                      ultra-smooth surface, cushioned by a thin film of pressurized                      air. Working in weightlessness is like being on a three-dimensional                      ice-skating rink, and the air-bearing table is designed to                      show an astronaut how tricky that can be. However, it only                      allows freedom of motion in two dimensions at once.                                          Then                      there was the ""Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory"", actually the                      world's largest swimming pool, containing mockups of the shuttle                      cargo bay and Hubble telescope. Underwater, wearing a pressurized                      space suit, an astronaut can practice working in three-dimensions.                      But there are drawbacks. Unlike the vacuum of space, water                      creates resistance whenever you try to move through it. And                      of course, a space-suited astronaut in the ""water tank"" doesn't                      enjoy the weightless conditions of a real space walk. Being                      upside down, for example, feels more like standing on your                      head -- and you're likely to feel your shoulders digging into                      the metal bearings inside your space suit. ""The water ?is                      no darn good,"" Musgrave says. ""Even NASA doesn't really know                      about all the weaknesses [of practicing] in the water.""                                                                                                ""We                            never used a checklist. Because ... a ballerina doesn't                            have a checklist and neither does an opera singer ...                            We learned it by visualization.""                              Story Musgrave - Former Hubble Repairman                                                                                                                                           Nevertheless,                      Musgrave had spent countless hours rehearsing for the Hubble                      repairs by the time he and his crewmates left Earth. And most                      of all, Musgrave had spent a lot of time thinking about everything                      he would do during the Hubble repair. In fact, he'd been thinking                      about how to repair a space telescope for about 20 years --                      most of his astronaut career.                     So,                      how did he feel, as he awoke on launch morning, with one of                      NASA's most important missions ahead of him?                       ""It's                      just like going to the Olympics. You are totally trained.                      You are honed to the edge…. You've done what you can do. That's                      it."" Even so, Musgrave says, he could never be sure of success.                      ""You don't know whether you're going to win the Olympics.                      How could you know?"" In the end, he says, he looked at the                      challenge the way a high-jumper does: ""It's you and the bar.""                                           A                      Dancer's Grace                                           When Musgrave finally emerged from the Space Shuttle's cabin                      into the vacuum of space, there was a sense of familiarity                      about it all. Not just because he'd trained so hard, but because                      he'd walked in space before: Musgrave had made the first walk                      of the shuttle program, in 1982. And months of practicing                      for the repair had given him an extraordinary familiarity                      with the Hubble's components.                      For                      example, if Musgrave's job was to install a new high-resolution                      camera, he made sure he could visualize exactly what was going                      on inside the instrument with every turn of every screw. If                      that sounds like the ultimate nuts-and-bolts experience, then                      Musgrave has a surprising description of the repair:                      ""It                      was a ballet.""                      A                      ballet? Two figures in bulky space suits and massive backpacks                      aren't exactly the picture of grace. And yet, Musgrave strove                      for dancer's grace in his movements. ""You have to worry about                      every finger and toe. If you've got a hand out of place in                      the ballet … you're going to lose style.""                      During                      training, he says, ""I would go through ballet books page after                      page,"" studying the dancer's version of perfection, and translating                      it in his mind to perfect space-walking technique.                      What                      does that perfect technique look like?                      During                      a Hubble repair, it often means working in confined areas,                      like the access doorway leading to a delicate scientific instrument,                      without moving your body. In such situations, Musgrave says,                      ""The ideal form for a space walker is to see a lot of motion                      at the wrist level, less at the elbow and almost none at the                      shoulders.""                      There's                      another aspect of a dancer's method that the astronauts used:                      Visualization. ""We never used a checklist. Because, you know,                      a ballerina doesn't have a checklist and neither does an opera                      singer... We learned it by visualization."" The same technique                      let Musgrave keep track of some three hundred separate tools.                      He and his fellow spacewalkers had tools to handle every possible                      contingency. And yet, even in weightlessness, in the shuttle's                      cavernous cargo bay, Musgrave says he never lost track of                      them. ""You could ask me halfway into [any spacewalk] where                      all three hundred tools were, and I could rattle them off.""                                           If                      keeping track of the tools sounds tough, try using them. The                      hardest part of any spacewalk, Musgrave says, is working with                      your hands in pressurized gloves. If you want to understand                      why, try squeezing a tennis ball, repeatedly, for hours on                      end. Opening and closing your hand inside a space-suit glove                      is just as tiring. For that reason, Musgrave says he tried                      to avoid clutching objects. ""Any time I see myself grabbing                      I say, 'Is there another way to do it?' I don't grab things.                      I push and I touch."" To use a power tool, for example, he                      cradled it between his two gloves, without actually holding                      on.                                            Musgrave during his first Hubble spacewalk                      in 1993                     Still,                      some jobs required an almost impossible level of dexterity.                      Musgrave remembers that in order to install one component,                      he had to undo ten sets of connectors, which were secured                      by tiny screws -- and he had to do it while his feet were                      anchored on the shuttle's sixty-foot robotic arm.                      ""There                      were little connections in the back of this box, the size                      of what's in the back of your PC. And they had little screws                      that are only about three millimeters long. I had a wrench                      that was about three feet long, and I was on the end of a                      sixty foot arm, and I had to drive these little screws three-and-a-half                      turns.""                      That                      was hard enough with space suit gloves. But keeping the screws                      from floating away -- possibly inside the telescope's delicate                      mechanisms -- made it even tougher.                      ""That                      was the most demanding job I had ever done,"" Musgrave says.                      ""I was on the edge of my ability.""                      The                      Glow of Success? Not Really                       Musgrave                      made three of the mission's five spacewalks. When it was all                      over, Musgrave knew he had done his job well. But he didn't                      share his crewmates' jubliation at a successful mission. ""I                      put on a smile for people,"" he remembers. ""I felt humble and                      quiet."" The reason, Musgrave says, is that he couldn't be                      sure, even then, that the telescope was fixed. He didn't know                      that until the repaired Hubble sent back its first new images.                                           By                      that time, Musgrave was back home, in Houston. He remembers                      the thrill of seeing Hubble's magnificent face-on image of                      the spiral galaxy called M-100. Even then, Musgrave says,                      he didn't think about what he and his crewmates -- along with                      dozens of flight controllers, mission planners, and engineers                      -- had helped to accomplish.                      ""It                      was transcendent. I looked at M-100 and I said, ""My God …                      It's just gorgeous. And after that, then I had to think, 'Oh,                      it's repaired.'""                                          FLORIDA                      TODAY - December 22, 1999                     Astronauts                      catch telescope, ready to begin repairs                       By                      Robyn Suriano                                         CAPE                      CANAVERAL, Fla. - By day's end, the Hubble Space Telescope                      could be ready for another decade of work studying the cosmos.                                           Two                      astronauts are to fix the telescope's broken pointing system                      today during the most important of three spacewalks planned                      for shuttle Discovery's mission.                       Hubble                      was captured late Tuesday by Discovery's robot arm and placed                      inside the ship's cargo bay, where spacewalking astronauts                      can work on the four-story observatory.                       Walks                      scheduled for Thursday and Friday include giving Hubble a                      better computer brain and making other equipment improvements.                                            But                      NASA considers today's spacewalk top priority.                       Soon                      after floating outside at 2:40 p.m., astronauts Steve Smith                      and John Grunsfeld are to begin fixing the broken pointing                      system that caused Hubble to stop its science work last month.                                            The                      job calls for replacing three toaster-sized boxes holding                      devices called gyroscopes, which help Hubble point toward                      planets, stars and other targets.                       ""The                      gyroscopes on Hubble are the most accurate ever built,"" said                      John Campbell, the telescope's project manager at NASA's Goddard                      Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ""Without them, stars                      would just be fuzzy points of light. Those (gyroscopes) keep                      Hubble stable and day after day, recording points of light                      and sharp images.""                       The                      spacewalks are possible following the perfect capture of Hubble                      on Tuesday, when Discovery started out about 330 miles away                      from the observatory.                       Gradually                      gaining on the telescope all day, shuttle Commander Curt Brown                      had guided his ship within 680 feet of the four-story observatory                      by 7 p.m.                       Brown,                      an Air Force colonel and fighter pilot, slowly closed the                      remaining distance at less than 1 mph to bring Discovery within                      35 feet of the glistening observatory.                       Then                      French astronaut Jean Francois Clervoy used controls inside                      the shuttle to grab onto the telescope with the shuttle's                      robot arm at 7:34 p.m. At the time, the pair was flying 369                      miles over the Gulf of Mexico.                       ""Houston,                      we have Hubble,"" Clervoy radioed Mission Control at the Johnson                      Space Center in Houston.                       ""Everyone                      here congratulates you on your first-class job,"" astronaut                      Steve Robinson replied from Mission Control.                       Launched                      Sunday from Kennedy Space Center, Discovery is on an eight-day                      mission that will keep it aloft during Christmas before heading                      home Dec. 27.

THE                      SHUTTLE WAS launched Sunday after nine postponements, and                      it took almost two days for Discovery to catch up with Hubble.                      The orbital chase culminated at 7:34 p.m. ET, when French                      astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy caught hold of the 43-foot,                      25,000-pound telescope with Discovery’s robot arm.                      “We have Hubble grappled,” Clervoy reported. Mission Control                      congratulated him on a “first-class job.”                      The                      rendezvous took place while the shuttle flew over Houston,                      and from NASA’s Johnson Space Center, Mission Control reported                      that some people on the ground could actually see the glint                      of the two spacecraft as they flew over.                     “It                      was really a great show from our point of view,” Mission Control                      reported. “Ours might have been a little better,” commander                      Curt Brown answered wryly.                     The                      telescope was then drawn slowly into the shuttle cargo bay                      and latched into a specially designed work platform. Then,                      using a camera mounted on the robot arm, the crew methodically                      checked out the telescope’s exterior. Beginning Wednesday,                      the astronauts are to conduct three spacewalks over three                      days to get Hubble working again and refurbish it.                     The                      Hubble has been disabled for more than a month because of                      failed gyroscopes, which are needed to keep the telescope                      steady for aiming at stars, galaxies and other celestial objects.                     The                      collapse of the pointing system left the telescope a little                      shaky and forced some changes in Discovery’s approach. But                      Brown said he and his crew had practiced for such a case and                      were not worried.

It is the third service call                      to the $3 billion Hubble. In December 1993, astronauts fitted                      the telescope with corrective optics because of a mirror with                      a design flaw. The Hubble got its last tuneup in February                      1997.                      Besides                      four dead gyroscopes with corroded wires, the Hubble has a                      broken radio transmitter, an old-fashioned computer and data                      recorder, batteries that are increasingly prone to overheating,                      and peeling skin.                     At                      least some of the decline is due to the fact that the Hubble                      has been orbiting Earth for almost 10 years and traveled 1.4                      billion miles, more than 15 times the distance between the                      Earth and the sun.                     Discovery’s                      four designated spacewalkers will replace all those parts                      and more with improved units, and hang stainless steel covers                      on the outside of the telescope to protect it from the blistering                      sun.                     SHORTENED                      SCHEDULE                      Four days of spacewalking had been planned, but one had to                      be canceled because of the mission’s late start, the result                      of equipment problems and lousy weather.                     NASA                      said all the major objectives can be accomplished in three                      outings, with any leftover jobs to be handled by future missions.                                           The                      shuttle is scheduled to return to Earth on Monday. NASA wants                      Discovery back with a few days to spare before New Year’s                      Eve to avoid any potential Y2K computer problems.                                          FloridaToday,                       Tuesday,                      December 21, 1999                     Update for 7:37 p.m.                    EST                       With Hubble safely                      attached to the shuttle's robot arm, Clervoy is now moving                      Hubble into a proper position to place it into the cargo bay                      and lock it down on a service platform.                        Update for 7:34                      p.m. EST                       Discovery has captured                      Hubble!                        ""We have a good capture,                      we have Hubble grappled,"" said Jean-Francois Clervoy.                       The grapple took place                      369 miles over the Gulf of Mexico.                        Update for 7:31                      p.m. EST                       The brakes are off                      on the robot arm, allowing Clervoy to begin to move in on                      the telescope to grab it.                        Update for 7:28                      p.m. EST                       Commander Brown now                      has the shuttle in position for the capture of the telescope                      using the robot arm. That means Discovery is now about 30                      feet from Hubble and very slowly rotating at the same speed                      as Hubble.                       The grapple is scheduled                      for 7:41 p.m. EST, in about 15 minutes.                        Update for 7:25                      p.m. EST                       Mission commentator                      Kyle Herring says that the Ku-band antenna is now back in                      communications mode but it is blocked from being able to send                      TV signals to Earth, so it will be a few more hours before                      we get our first look at Hubble during this mission.                        Update for 7:23                      p.m. EST                       Now 60 feet away.                      Closing at a one-tenth of a foot per second rate.                        Update for 7:17                      p.m. EST                       Flight controllers                      have finished sending commands to Hubble to prepare it for                      the grapple.                       Commander Brown is                      flying Discovery to match Hubble's slow rotation and make                      it possible for Jean-Francois Clervoy to grab Hubble with                      the shuttle's robot arm.                       Discovery is 120 feet                      away moving closer at two-tenths of a foot per second.                        Update for 7:13                      p.m. EST                       Discovery now inside                      200 feet from Hubble.                        Update for 7:03                      p.m. EST                       Discovery now on the                      R-bar and moving up to Hubble.                       Now 600 feet away                      and moving less than one foot per second toward Hubble and                      slowing.                       This is the third                      visit of a shuttle crew to Hubble since it was deployed by                      another Discovery crew commanded by Loren Shriver in April                      1990.                        Update for 7 p.m.                      EST                       Using a hand-held                      lazer aimed at the telescope, the distance between Discovery                      and Hubble agrees with the shuttle's radar.                       The shuttle's radar                      uses the same Ku-band antenna dish that live TV is transmitted                      to Earth on. The Ku-band antenna can be used for communication                      or navigation, but not both, which is why there is no pictures                      from space yet on NASA TV.                       Earlier, mission commentator                      Kyle Herring said there is a chance that once the shuttle                      gets close enough to Hubble and can't use its radar anymore,                      that the switch to TV might be possible and some pictures                      could be beamed back.                       If not, the crew is                      recording this rendezvous on tape and is scheduled to play                      it back later this evening.                       Discovery now approaching                      the ""R-bar,"" which is an imaginary line drawn from Hubble                      down to the center of the Earth. Once the shuttle hits the                      R-bar it will stop and move up the line to complete the rendezvous.                        Update for 6:52                      p.m. EST                       A fourth burn has                      taken place and Discovery is now 1,780 feet away from Hubble,                      closing at a rate of 2.2 feet per second.                       Discovery commander                      Curt Brown, floating in the rear of the flight deck, will                      now take over the final manual approach to the telescope.                        Update for 6:35                      p.m. EST                       A third midcourse                      correction burn following the TI burn has taken place and                      Discovery is now about one mile away from Hubble.                       The astronauts report                      they can see the observatory through the optics of one of                      their navigation devices.                       Discovery is moving                      about 6 feet per second toward Hubble, which is reported ready                      for Discovery's arrival.                        Update for 6:10                      p.m. EST                       Discovery is now about                      four miles from Hubble.                       Mission Control has                      reported that a communications link between the ground and                      Hubble through Discovery has been established.                        Update for 5:30                      p.m. EST                       The 16-second-long                      Terminal Initiation burn using Discovery's reaction control                      system jets has taken place without incident. The shuttle                      is now on a course that will have Discovery and the Hubble                      Space Telescope coming within 30 feet of each other in about                      two hours.                       The two are separated                      now by under 10 miles.                        Update for 5:12                      p.m. EST                       Discovery astronauts                      have been given a ""go"" for the TI burn. This small firing                      of the shuttle's steering jets will send the shuttle on an                      intercept course to Hubble.                       The scheduled time                      of the grapple is 7:41 p.m. but the exact time will depend                      on the precise orientation of Hubble once Discovery arrives.                      Hubble is in safe mode right now following the failure of                      a gyroscope several weeks ago, so its exact orientation in                      space relative to the shuttle and Earth is not known.                       Discovery commander                      Curt Brown will have to look over the situation and manually                      fly Discovery into the proper position next to Hubble so the                      robot arm can be used to grab the telescope. This might require                      the exact grapple time be adjusted.                        Update for 4:45                      p.m. EST                       All still proceeding                      smoothly for the rendezvous with Hubble.                       We'll have more frequent                      updates after the Terminal Initiation burn at 5:28 p.m. EST                      and post image captures on our  Space                      Today  page as soon as Hubble comes into clear view on                      NASA TV.                        Update for 2:45                      p.m. EST                       Discovery is slowly                      approaching the Hubble Space Telescope and is now about 47                      miles away from the observatory.                       Discovery commander                      Curt Brown and pilot Scott Kelly have made a series of course                      corrections today to close the gap between the shuttle and                      the telescope. The final approach to Hubble is expected to                      begin at 5:28 p.m. with the so-called Terminal Initiation,                      or TI, burn.                       Less than two hours                      later Discovery will be within 30 feet of Hubble, and then                      Jean-Francois Clervoy will operate the shuttle's 50-foot-long                      robot arm to grab the telescope at 7:41 p.m. EST and move                      it into position in the cargo bay and set it down in a cradle                      at 8:01 p.m. EST.                       Abour 39 minutes later                      cameras on the robot arm will be aimed at the telescope and                      the astronauts and Mission Control will inspect the exterior                      of the observatory.                       - Jim Banke                                                                FloridaToday - Dec. 20, 1999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Discovery                            streaks off for rendezvous with Hubble                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Shuttle                            Discovery lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in                            these images captured from NASA TV.                                                                                                                                  Hubble's                      wait almost over                       By Robyn Suriano                      FLORIDA                      TODAY CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - At long last, shuttle Discovery                      is in orbit today and racing toward the Hubble Space Telescope                      on a mission to bring the observatory back to life.                      The                      spaceship lifted off Sunday night from Kennedy Space Center,                      narrowly beating NASA's deadline for launching this year after                      months of technical delays and a weekend spate of bad weather.                                           NASA                      had to fly Sunday or wait until January to avoid have the                      ship aloft at year's end and exposing it to potential Y2K                      problems.                      The                      success puts Discover's seven astronauts on course to fix                      Hubble's broken pointing system and return home Dec. 27, becoming                      the first American crew to be in space over Christmas since                      1973.                      More                      importantly to NASA, the mission restores the shuttles to                      flight after a troubled year that has seen the agency suffer                      through a grounding of the fleet because of wiring problems                      and two vanished Mars probes.                      ""We                      have what I believe is a darn near perfect vehicle on orbit                      right now, and things are going extremely well,"" said senior                      shuttle manager Don McMonagle. He went on to say that ""our                      confidence in this (shuttle) team remains unshaken. The events                      of the last five months have made us a stronger program.""                                           Throughout                      today, Discovery's path around Earth will be refined with                      every orbit to bring it closer to Hubble.                      The                      ship is to reach the telescope Tuesday, when the crew is to                      capture it with the shuttle's robot arm and gently hoist it                      into their cargo bay.                      Then                      spacewalking astronauts are to make three excursions Wednesday,                      Thursday and Friday to improve and repair the telescope, which                      stopped all science work last month when its pointing system                      broke down.                      In                      addition to fixing that system, the astronauts are to install                      an advanced computer brain and spread new insulation over                      parts of the telescope.                      Hubble                      is to be set free again on Christmas Day, giving NASA officials                      what they call the best present possible. If all goes well,                      Hubble could resume work in mid-January and make new discoveries                      to deepen scientists' understanding of the universe.                      ""We                      are in a renaissance for astronomy,"" said Ed Weiler, NASA's                      chief scientist at agency headquarters in Washington, D.C.                      ""Over the last 10 years, we've taken great leaps in answering                      basic questions about the universe, and more importantly,                      in (finding out) the things we don't know. ""I think Hubble                      has done a real good job putting us in our place.""                                           The orbiting telescope was designed to be worked on by spacewalking                      astronauts, and a good thing, too. Unbeknownst to NASA, the                      $3-billion observatory was launched in 1990 with a faulty                      mirror that kept it from seeing clearly.                      The                      problem was corrected when Hubble's first crew of spacewalking                      astronauts made repairs in 1993. Another group returned to                      the telescope in 1997 to give Hubble a tune-up.                      NASA                      didn't plan on returning to the observatory again until 2000,                      but officials decided to send Discovery this year after equipment                      failures threatened to shut down the observatory's pointing                      system.                      The                      much-delayed mission did not get there in time, however, with                      another breakdown causing Hubble to cease all science work                      Nov. 13.                      With                      the repairs and two future tune-up missions, NASA officials                      think Hubble will be at work through 2010 and continue to                      produce more historic discoveries.                      Among                      its greatest contributions to date, scientists count Hubble's                      work in: The study of galaxies.                      One                      of Hubble's famous images is a dazzling shot of millions of                      dots of light - almost each one representing a galaxy containing                      billions of stars.                      To                      get the photo, Hubble stared deep into the universe for 10                      straight days. It shows that galaxies formed very early after                      the universe was formed in the Big Bang about 12 billion years                      ago.                      The                      finding shocked scientists, who believed galaxies took a long                      time to get going.                      ""We                      were quite surprised because what we saw were pretty well-formed                      objects one billion years after the Big Bang, perhaps as little                      as 800 million years after the Big Bang, which means the epic                      of galaxy formation occurred much earlier than most models                      predicted,"" Weiler said.                      Finding                      black holes.                       Scientists always believed black holes existed, but had no                      proof. Hubble changed that in 1994, when it first took images                      of matter swirling around the gaping center of a black hole.                                           ""That                      was the first proof, the first really hard evidence for a                      black hole, and since then Hubble has been detecting many                      black holes,"" said Anne Kinney, a Hubble astronomer at agency                      headquarters.                      Planet                      formation.                       Hubble has taken many images of stars surrounded by the clouds                      of dust and debris that are the breeding grounds for solar                      systems.                      The                      pictures - believed to be planets in their early stages of                      development - make astronomers think that the universe could                      be teeming with worlds that might hold life.                      ""Hubble's                      real contribution is showing that the process of creating                      solar systems is probably very, very common,"" Weiler said.                                           Scientists                      think Hubble could do more solid work, provided all goes well                      during this mission.                      ""I                      think we have some wonderful astronomy to look ahead to, and                      what we need to do now is get up there, and get the telescope                      serviced so we can get back to work,"" Kinney said.                      Discovery's                      mission started flawlessly Sunday with a smooth countdown                      and spectacular liftoff at 7:50 p.m.                      ""We                      appreciate your patience in hanging in there with us,"" launch                      director Dave King told the crew just before liftoff. ""We                      hope you have a great mission to Hubble, and we'll see you                      back here before the next millennium.""                      Replied                      commander Curtis Brown Jr.: ""We have one request - we'd like                      you to send a note to Hubble to get ready, because we're on                      our way!""                      The                      trouble-free launch contrasted sharply with the agency's last                      flight in July, when shuttle Columbia had a short circuit                      during liftoff that took out two computers controlling the                      ship's main engines.                      The                      ship made it to orbit safely, but could have been forced to                      make an emergency landing in Africa if more computers had                      been lost.                      As                      a result, NASA grounded its spaceships in August after just                      two flights until fleetwide wiring inspections could be carried                      out.                      More                      than 100 miles of wire were checked, and 50 exposed electrical                      cables were repaired in Discovery. But the ship's problems                      didn't end with the wiring.                      One                      of the shuttle's main engines had to be replaced when engineers                      found a piece of a drill bit lodged inside, and new wiring                      damage was found on the ship's external fuel tank.                      More                      troubles included a dented fuel line and concern that the                      ship's main fuel lines may have been welded together incorrectly.                                           All                      the technical issues were resolved by Friday, when NASA was                      ready for its first launch attempt.                      Weather                      didn't cooperate, however, and thick clouds and rain thwarted                      another attempt Saturday.                      After                      weeks of saying they would not launch beyond Saturday, NASA                      decided to give itself one more chance and try launching Sunday.                                           The                      result is a shortened mission - from 10 days to 8 - and loss                      of a planned spacewalk that would have focused on more insulation                      repair work.                                                                                      Kennedy                      Space Center Shuttle Status Report, December 19, 1999, 8:30                      p.m. EST                     MISSION:                      STS-103 - 3 rd  Hubble Space Telescope Servicing                      Mission                       VEHICLE:                      Discovery/OV-103                      LOCATION: On orbit                      TARGET KSC LAUNCH DATE/TIME: December 19 at 7:50 p.m. EST                      TARGET LANDING DATE/TIME: December 27 at about 5:24 p.m. EST                      LAUNCH WINDOW: 42 minutes                      MISSION DURATION: 7 days, 21 hours, 34 minutes; with 3 EVAs                                            CREW: Brown, Kelly, Smith, Foale, Grunsfeld, Nicollier, Clervoy                      ORBITAL ALTITUDE and INCLINATION: 317 nautical miles/28.45                      degrees                     Work                      in progress: Space Shuttle Discovery and a seven-member flight                      crew lifted off from KSC's Launch Pad 39B on time at 7:50:00:069                      p.m. today.

Launch managers intended to begin operations to load the external                      tank at 11 a.m. today, but with a 70 percent chance of weather                      violation they delayed a go ahead decision to collect more                      weather data. By noon, weather officials reported an 80 percent                      probability that weather would prohibit tonight’s launch                      attempt. The primary concerns are thick layered clouds and                      rain showers.                     Shuttle                      managers are assessing the possibility of launching Discovery                      on Sunday, Dec. 19. Current forecasts indicate a 60 percent                      chance of favorable weather. Along with weather, managers                      are reviewing the feasibility of supporting contingency landing                      operations at Edward Air Force Base, CA, prior to the new                      year.

Its seven-member crew included two Hubble                      Servicing veterans.                     NASA                      decided to split the HST Third Servicing Mission (SM3) into                      two parts, SM3A and SM3B, after the third of Hubble's six                      gyroscopes failed. The second part of the mission, SM3B, is                      tentatively scheduled for mid-2001.                     The                      gyros, part of Hubble's sophisticated pointing system, help                      hold the telescope steady during observations. Hubble only                      needs three gyros to conduct science operations.                     In                      addition to the gyros, astronauts have also replaced a guidance                      sensor and a transmitter, and install a new, advanced central                      computer, a digital data recorder, an electronics enhancement                      kit, battery improvement kits, and new outer layers of thermal                      protection. The eight-day flight included three scheduled                      spacewalks, each lasting six hours.                                           On November 13, 1999, the Hubble Space Telescope was placed                      into  safe-hold                       after the failure of a fourth gyroscope. This mode had been                      thoroughly tested and used twice since Hubble's launch in                      1990. The telescope was not at risk. This protective mode                      allows ground control of the telescope, but with only two                      gyros working, Hubble cannot be aimed with the precision necessary                      for scientific observations of the sky.  The                      aperture door had been closed to protect the optics, and the                      spacecraft was aligned to the sun to ensure that adequate                      power was received by Hubble's solar panels.

The last ""Crew                      Fam"" for SM3A took place July 6-9, 1999. From Tuesday                      to Friday, the astronauts trained with actual SM3A flight                      hardware and EVA crew aids and tools (CATs). Most of the ""Crew                      Fam"" occurred in the Clean Room at Goddard Space Flight                      Center, Maryland, and the crew also worked with high fidelity                      Hubble mock-ups in other buildings.                     During                      these four days, the crew spent long hours rehearsing their                      space walks. Using space gloves, flight Space Support Equipment                      (SSE), and Crew Aids and Tools (CATs), the astronauts trained                      with and verified flight orbital replacement unit (ORU) hardware.                      These included the SM3A  Fine Guidance                      Sensor ,  Advanced Computer ,                       Rate Sensor Units ,  Voltage                      Improvement Kits ,  Solid State                      Recorder ,  S-Band Single Access                      Transmitter ,  New Outer Blanket                      Layer , and Forward  Shell/Shield                      Replacement Fabric .                     The                      crew worked with a number of trainers and simulators, such                      as the High Fidelity Mechanical Simulator, the Aft Shroud                      Door Trainer, the Forward Shell/Light Shield Simulator, and                      the Support Systems Module Bay Doors Simulator. They also                      trained and verified the flight Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier                      ( ORUC ) and its ancillary                      hardware.                      The                      a stronauts replaced all six gyroscopes, a Fine Guidance Sensor,                      an S-Band Single Access Transmitter, and Hubble's main computer.                      The new main computer will be 20 times faster with six times                      more memory, thereby reducing flight software maintenance                      and significantly lowering operation costs. Astronauts had                      also installed battery improvement kits, a digital recorder,                      and new thermal protection to Hubble's exterior.                     Payload                      Commander  Steven L. Smith                       was in charge of this servicing work. He is a veteran of two                      space flights, STS-68 in 1994 and STS-82 in 1997. On STS-82,                      the Hubble's Second Servicing Mission, Smith performed three                      spacewalks.                      Claude                      Nicollier  (ESA) is another seasoned Hubble crewmember:                      He controlled the Shuttle's robotic arm aboard STS-61, the                      Hubble's First Servicing Mission in 1993. He also served aboard                      STS-46 in 1992 and STS-75 in 1996.                     Five-time                      shuttle veteran  Michael Foale                       flew aboard STS-45 in 1992, STS-56 in 1993, and the STS-63                      rendezvous with MIR in 1995. STS-84 dropped him off at MIR                      in 1997 for a four-month stay and STS-86 returned him to Earth.                      Foale has spent over 160 days in space, including 10.5 hours                      of spacewalking.                      Fellow                      spacewalker  John Grunsfeld                       served on two earlier missions, the 1995 Astro Observatory                      mission aboard STS-67 and the fifth mission to MIR on STS-81                      in 1997.                      STS-103                      has been Commander  Curt Brown 's                      sixth Shuttle mission, and his third as commander. He led                      STS-95 in 1998 (which carried several Goddard payloads including                      the HST Orbital Systems Test) and STS-85 in 1997, and he served                      as pilot aboard STS-77 in 1996, STS-66 in 1994, and STS-47                      in 1992.                      SM3A                      was  Jean-Francois Clervoy 's                      third trip to space: In 1994, he operated the robotic arm                      aboard STS-66 to deploy the CRISTA-SPAS atmospheric satellite,                      and in 1997, he visited the Russian Mir Space Station aboard                      STS-84.                     Pilot                      Scott Kelly —the identical twin of astronaut Mark Kelly—was                      a first-time space traveler.

This mission will    install a new science instrument, the Advanced Camera for Surveys    (ACS), new rigid Solar Arrays (SA3), new Power Control Unit (PCU)    and a new Cryocooler for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object    Spectrometer (NICMOS).  STS-109 will also reboost  HST  to a higher    orbit.      Launch:       March 1, 2002 6:22:02 a.m. EST  Launch Window was 64 minutes.       On Friday, March 1, 2002, the 3 hour tanking operation was completed at 12:13 a.m.  The crew departed the Operations and Checkout (O&C) Building and arrived at the launch pad shortly after 3a.m. EST.  The hatch was closed slightly later than planned due to one of the hatch closeout microswitch  indicators .  The  Orbiter  Access Arm (OAA) retracted at 6:15 a.m EST. Launch occured at the opening of the launch window.    On Wednesday, February 27, 2002, the  Columbia 's launch was postponed until Friday, March 1st due to concerns about cold weather.  Mission managers were also meeting to discuss conerns about ball bearings inside  Columbia 's  main landing gear .  On Thursday, the temperature at the planned shuttle launch time was 38 degrees Fahrenheit (just inside an acceptable range for launch).  Temperature forcasts call for 55 degrees Fahrenheit at launch time on Friday.  A Shuttle engineering team completed an extensive evaluation of the landing gear bearing issue and has determined there are no technical constraints that will impact the STS-109 landing.   ( Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/28/2002 )     On Monday, February 25, 2002, the  launch countdown  clock picked up on schedule at the  T-43 hour mark  at 10 a.m.  The STS-109 crewmembers arrived at KSC at 1:00 a.m. this morning and spent about two hours at  Pad A  performing a final inspection of the  HST  payload.  ( Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/25/2002 )     On Friday, February 22, 2002, final pre-launch processing for Shuttle Columbia continues on schedule at Complex 39  Pad A  . The Hubble payload Interface Verification Test is complete and the End-To-End Test is in progress. Work over the weekend includes completing  aft  closeouts prior to picking up the final countdown at the T-43 hour mark at 10 a.m. Monday, Feb. 25. The seven STS-109 crewmembers are scheduled to land at KSC at 1 a.m. Monday, and shortly after their arrival they will spend about two hours at the launch pad participating in final Hubble payload configuration familiarization operations in preparation for the five spacewalks that will be conducted during the STS-109 servicing mission. The payload doors will be closed later in the day. The status of the  Auxiliary Power Unit  hydraulic pump bolts is still under evaluation. (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 2/22/2002)  On 1/28/02, Shuttle  Columbia  rolled out to Launch Complex 39A and is undergoing final preparations. The main engine Flight Readiness Test is complete and the two-day Countdown Demonstration Test (CDT) is underway, with a  T-0  at 11 a.m. on Friday. The seven STS-109 crewmembers will be at the launch pad for familiarization and emergency egress operations today and will be onboard  Columbia  tomorrow to participate in the final hours of the simulated countdown.  ( Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/31/2002 )        The rollout of Shuttle  Columbia  from the  Vehicle Assembly Building  ( VAB ) to Pad 39A was rescheduled for no earlier than Saturday morning due to requirements to continue trouble-shooting and verifying a faulty bearing in the steering linkage on one of the crawler-transporter's (CT) four ""trucks."" In addition, NASA management mandated that all of the trucks on the CT be inspected and verified prior to commencing rollout activities. The rollout had been scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 23, but was delayed due to th  crawler  problem. No impact to the prelaunch milestones or launch date is expected.  ( Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/24/2002 )     On January 17, 2002,  Columbia  rolled over from the  OPF  into the Vehicle Assembly Building ( VAB ).  ( Reference KSC Shuttle Status 1/17/2002 )      The launch date for STS-109 was earlier pushed back to give engineers time to evaluate a reaction wheel problem on the Hubble Space Telescope.  Previous launch dates were February 14, 2002, January 17, 2002, January 11, 2001 and before that November 19, 2001.

Their 8-hour, 10-minute space walk, the third longest                      in history, also saw replacement of a 550-pound fine guidance                      sensor.                      Flight                      controllers said all major activities of the space walk, the                      second of three on consecutive days of Discovery's space telescope                      repair and improvement mission, had been accomplished. Controllers                      reported that power was reaching both of the new pieces of                      equipment.                      ""The                      brains of Hubble have been replaced,"" said Mission Specialist                      John Grunsfeld, who worked Thursday in Discovery's cabin with                      the space-walking crew members outside. About 30 minutes later                      Hubble began thinking with those new brains. At an evening                      mission status briefing, John Campbell, Hubble Space Telescope                      program manager, said the functional checkout of the new computer                      showed it was functioning well. Checkout of the Fine Guidance                      Sensor, is continuing.                      The                      length of Thursday's space walk made it the third longest                      in history, behind only the 8-hour, 15-minute effort on Wednesday                      by Payload Commander Steve Smith and Grunsfeld and an 8-hour,                      29-minute space walk by three Endeavor astronauts on STS-49                      on its Intelsat rescue mission in May 1992.                      Replacement                      of one of Hubble's two S-band transmitters is a highlight                      of Friday's space walk by Smith and Grunsfeld. The transmitter                      to be replaced had failed. The second transmitter was able                      to carry the load alone, so no science was lost. The transmitters                      are considered very reliable, and unlike most of the equipment                      aboard Hubble, they were not designed to be changed out in                      orbit. Special tools were developed to enable astronauts to                      do the job more easily. Installation of a Solid State Recorder                      to replace a less reliable and less capable 10-year-old recorder                      is the second major item on the schedule.                                           Also on the timeline of the space walk, scheduled to begin                      at 1:50 p.m. CST, is installation of new insulation on equipment                      bay doors. The spacewalk could, like its two predecessors                      on STS-103, begin earlier if the crew completes preparations                      early. Flight controllers are anxious to end this third space                      walk at 8 p.m. as scheduled.                                           Discovery remains is in excellent condition, in an orbit with                      a high point of 380 statute miles and a low point of 364 miles.                      The next status report will be issued at 11 a.m. Friday, or                      as events warrant.                                          Hubble                      Project Update, Thursday, December 23, 9:30 PM EST                     Mike                      Foale and European Space Agency astronaut Claude Nicollier                      got an early start today in the second successful spacewalk                      of the mission. The crew installed Hubble's new main computer                      and replaced one of the telescope's three Fine Guidance Sensors.                      Foale and Nicollier also installed a new thermal blanket layer                      over Bay 1, which houses the main computer.                      The                      new computer is 20 times faster with six times the memory                      of the outdated unit it replaces. The enhanced Fine Guidance                      unit flew on Hubble before--it was removed on STS-82 during                      the Second Servicing Mission in February 1997 and refurbished.                      Hubble uses three Fine Guidance Sensors to precisely point                      as it conducts scientific observations.                                           Foale has walked in space twice before, during the STS-63                      mission in February 1995 and again in September 1997 on his                      mission to Mir. Nicollier visited Hubble in December 1993                      aboard STS-61, the first servicing mission to Hubble. On that                      mission, he controlled the Shuttle's robotic arm. Today was                      his first spacewalk.                                          Space                      Telescope Operations Control Center Update                      UPDATE NO. 4 (Rev. 1)                       Thursday, Dec. 23 1999 - 3:30 p.m. EST                        A                      lot of smiles here in the STOCC today after yesterday's very                      successful replacement of all six of Hubble's gyroscopes.                      The STOCC has been very active the past 24 hours with several                      thousand commands uplinked to the Hubble as part of the test                      and checkout of new components installed in the Telescope                      yesterday.                      Immediately                      after astronauts Steven Smith and John Grunsfeld installed                      the three new Rate Sensor Units in Hubble, controllers conducted                      an initial ""aliveness"" test of the gyros and they all checked                      out fine.                      A                      more thorough functional test of the 3 units - each containing                      a pair of gyroscopes - was performed after the crew went to                      sleep, and those checks were also very successful.                      Controllers                      also completed testing of the six Voltage/Temperature Improvement                      Kits, or VIKS, that the astronauts installed yesterday on                      each battery. All six VIKS are working exactly as expected.                      Hubble's 10-year old batteries work well, but are more susceptible                      to overheating than when they were brand new. The VIKs will                      prevent battery overcharging and associated overheating.                      Controllers                      in the STOCC are preparing for today's second space walk.                                           Astronauts                      will install a new, more powerful 486 computer during EVA                      2. To prepare Hubble for the replacement, controllers will                      turn off the old computer. Once the new computer is installed,                      controllers will boot it up, a procedure that takes about                      an hour, and then begin several hours of detailed checks to                      verify the computer is interacting properly with Hubble's                      hardware and systems.                      The                      EVA crew will also install a new fine guidance sensor - one                      of three on Hubble - which are used to provide pointing for                      the Telescope and also serve as a scientific instrument for                      astrometric science. This new unit is actually one that was                      removed from Hubble on the second servicing mission and has                      been refurbished and outfitted with an enhanced alignment                      capability. Controllers will conduct a functional test of                      the new guidance sensor, a task that should take about an                      hour. The guidance unit that Discovery will bring home will                      be refurbished and installed on the fourth servicing mission.                                           Ground                      systems here in the STOCC continue to perform well, and controllers                      here at Goddard are ready for today's space walk.                                          Johnson                    Space Center STS-103 Report # 08                     Thursday, December 23, 1999, 11:00 am EST                      Discovery's                      seven-member crew began work early today, preparing for a                      busy day on orbit, including a second spacewalk and a final                      check of hardware installed on the Hubble Space Telescope                      during yesterday's spacewalk.                      The                      primary goal of today's spacewalk, to be conducted by Mike                      Foale and European Space Agency astronaut Claude Nicollier,                      is to install a new computer to replace the one currently                      in use by Hubble. The new computer is 20 times faster and                      has six times the memory of the outdated unit being replaced.                      Nicollier and Foale also will change out one of Hubble's three                      Fine Guidance Sensors that are used to precisely point the                      telescope as it conducts scientific observations. The unit                      being installed today is a refurbished unit that was removed                      and returned to Earth by the STS-82 crew during its servicing                      of the telescope in February 1997. If time permits, the space                      walkers also may perform some optional tasks. Foale has conducted                      two previous spacewalks, during the STS-63 mission in February                      1995 and again in September 1997 as he and Mir Space Station                      Commander Anatoly Solovyev conducted a six-hour survey of                      the Mir. This is Nicollier's first spacewalk.                                           Today's spacewalk is scheduled to begin at 1:50 p.m., but                      could begin earlier if the crew members complete their preparations                      ahead of schedule. During the spacewalk, Foale can be recognized                      by the broken red stripes on the legs of his EVA suit, and                      Nicollier by the diagonally broken red stripes on his suit.                                           Discovery's                      astronauts also supported a functional test of the voltage                      temperature improvement kits, referred to as VIKs, installed                      by Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld during their spacewalk yesterday.                      To ensure the checkout is complete prior to the start of today's                      scheduled EVA; the astronauts began the work shortly after                      crew wake-up. During the 90-minute long checkout, investigators                      will monitor the performance of the voltage kits as the telescope's                      batteries are charged.                                           This morning's wake-up music honored the two space-walking                      astronauts, Nicollier and Foale. Traditional Swiss music was                      played for Nicollier and the song ""Only When I Sleep""                      by The Corrs was played for Foale.                      Discovery                      remains in excellent condition, in an orbit with a high point                      of 380 statute miles and a low point of 369 miles. The next                      status report will be issued at 11 p.m. or as events warrant.

Extensive functional testing overnight confirms that the six                      new gyroscopes are performing as expected.                      Overnight,                      the Hubble team was looking over the extensive amount of photographic                      data we have collected. There are now over 450 photographs,                      all taken over the past two days.                      Once                      again, our astronaut team is eager to get to work. We anticipate                      another early start for EVA 2.

GX266-57-8465051	"State Travel News SPRING 1999  State Travel News A Publication Focusing on Travel Issues Relative to West Virginia State Government  West Virginia State Travel Management Office operates under the Administrative Ser vices Section of the Purchasing Division, Depar tment of Administration  Effective April 1, 1999  Internal Revenue Service Issues New Mileage Allowance Rate for 1999 Effective April 1, 1999, the new business standard mileage rate for employees who drive their own cars for work pur poses was reduced to 31 cents per mile, down from 32 cents in 1998. The reduction in the mileage rate was based on an annual study of the fixed and variable costs of operating an automobile conducted on behalf of the Internal Revenue Ser vice (IRS) by an independent contractor. A decline in gasoline prices and reductions in the depreciation rates of automobiles contributed to the decline in the costs of operating an automobile. In addition, the new rate recognizes thir ty-year lows in inflation. The IRS decided to postpone the implementation of the new rate from Januar y 1, 1999 until Apr il 1, to allo w businesses to update their payroll reimbursement procedures and employee handbooks. When news of the proposed reduction began to leak out, the IRS was showered with phone calls from companies asking for additional time to access the impact of the reduction on their travel expenses. Although many companies were forced to make changes to their reimbursement policies, the lower mileage reimbursement could mean savings for companies, which would end up paying less to employees. The 1998 mileage rate of 32.5 cents per mile continued to apply with respect to mileage allowances paid to an employee before April 1, 1999, for transpor tation expenses paid or incurred before that date. The 32.5 cents per mile rate also continued to apply for purposes of computing the amount allowable as a deduction for business related t ranspor tation expenses paid or incurred before April 1, 1999.

The statewide contract for the travel credit card expires on June 30; however, no decision has been made as to whether it will be rebid or renewed.   Federal Legislation Targeting Airline Consumers Makes Its Way to Congress Two bills are heading through the separate chambers of Congress. Senate Bill 383, sponsored by Ron Wyden, D-Oregon And John McCain, R-Ar iz ona, and House Bill 700, sponsored b y Rep . Bud Shuster, R-Pennsyl-vania, are designed to gain consumers a little respect. Briefly, below are key provisions of each. H.R. 700: Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 1999 v No use of a single flight number for flights involving transfers. v Full explanation of the reasons for delay, cancellations or diversion. v If the delay is more than two but less than three hours, the airline would be liable for double the ticket price. Delays of more than three hours would cost the airline three times the ticket price for each additional hour of delay. Airlines would not be accountable if air traffic control ordered the delay. v Cancellations would require the airline to get all passengers to their destination in a 'timely manner'...AND refund what had been paid for the flight. Senate 383: Airline Passenger Fairness Act. v If travelers ask, they would be told if their flight is oversold. v If travelers ask, they could get full access to all fares for a given carrier. v Travelers would be given reasonable advance notice about cancellations and accurate explanations why. v Travelers would be given a 48 hour cooling off period.. that is, two full days to ask for and get a full refund. v Full disclosure would be offered about the number of seats available for frequent flyer redemptions on each flight. This bill would also make legal 'back-to back' ticketing in which a passenger buys two round-trip tickets and discards half of each. This is at times cheaper than buying a round-trip ticket for the days the traveler wishes to fly. The bill would also legalize 'hidden cities,' in which a traveler buys a ticket to a distant city, leaving the plane at an intermediate one, because it is cheaper than buying a ticket to the real destination.

It is important to understand that as an airline traveler, you have certain rights. Let's examine some of these rights and next time an airline tries to 'bump' you, try testing out this information. If you're involuntarily bumped, the r ules are not e xactly g r acious . Airlines are required to make ever y effort to get you to your destination in a 'timely' fashion. If the delay between your original flight's arrival and the replacement flight's arrival is less than an hour, sorr y...there's no required compensation of any kind. However if the delay is 1 to 2 hours, the airline is required to pay you the equivalent of the one-way fare, up to $200. If the lag is longer than 2 hours, or if substitute flight arrangements can not be made, you get at least double the one-way fare, up to a ceiling of $400. Airlines are not required to pay cash or vouchers for food or a hotel room during a protracted involuntary layover, but they often give them to you if you ask. Bumping compensation rules do not apply to commuter flights, which are defined as 60 seats or fewer. Rules on international carriers var y from countr y to country, so if you are bumped on an international flight you may have fewer choices and amenities than you would expect on U.S. airlines. If you have bought a discounted ticket and the air line needs to bump someone, you may be at the top of the no-go list. The more you have paid for your ticket, the more likely you will make it on board. This, of course, is one of the few benefits for travelers stuck paying higher fares. Once bumped, twice...bumped? You could get bounced off of the next available flight too, especially if the flight is full of fullfare passengers. If that happens, you may end up with two round-trip tickets and/or a whopping case of hear tburn. OTHER STRATEGIES  RIGHTS AS TRAVELERS Please Read the Fine Print  v v  Always get seat assignments when you make a reser vation. Get to the air por t early. You always run the risk of forfeiting your seat when not checking in by a cer tain time frame before your flight's originally scheduled depar ture. That time varies from airline to airline, but is usually 20 to 30 minutes for a domestic flight and an hour or more for an international one. Check in right away, even if your flight is delayed. (Remember the rule about checking in before the original depar ture time.) Also, because the delay might end up being a cancellation, you will want to be first on line to be reticketed. You will also need all of your documents if you are flying on a carrier other than the one you originally booked. This is especially impor tant when flying on an E-ticket and changes need to be made. Ask whether it is possible to be upgraded on your new flight. If you have asked nicely, you may just get it.  v  TRAVEL CONTACTS National Travel Services, Inc.

Occasionally, airline attendants try to make the 'in-flight safety lecture' a bit more entertaining. Here's some real examples that have been repor ted: ""As we prepare for takeoff, please make sure your tray tables and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfor table position."" ""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only four ways out of this airplane..."" ""Your seat cushions can be used for floatation, and in the event of an emergency water landing, please take them with our compliments."" ""Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately."" As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker : 'Whoa, big fella....whoa' State Travel Management Office Purchasing Division State Capitol Complex 2019 Washington Street, East P.O. Box 50130 Charleston WV 25305-0130  Legislation Attempts to Improve Air Service to Small, Rural Communities The Air Service Restoration Act, 379, introduced by Sen. John Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, addresses the decline in air ser vice to small and rural communities. The bill was introduced because West Virginia has been hardest hit by air service declines in the twenty years of deregulation, where passenger emplacements statewide have declined by nearly 40 percent. The bill would provide a five-year $100 million pilot program for up to 40 small and under-ser ved communities, with grants of up to $500,000 to each community for local initiatives to attract and promote ser vices. It would provide the Depar tment of Transpor tation authority to facilitate links between pilot communities and major air por ts by requiring joint fares and interline agreements between dominant airlines at hub air por ts and new ser vice providers at under-ser ved air por ts. One of the most impor tant pieces in his bill is the interline provision which would ensure dominant carriers who control access to the air ser vice bottlenecks to not discr iminate against carriers who could provide connections to permit passengers to transfer between networks. Variations of provisions within this bill are included in the Senate's legislative version of FAA reauthorization, sponsored by Senate Commerce, Science, and Transpor tation Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona.  4"

This will guarantee that the Discovery                      will be safe from all possible Y2K problems under all contingency                      return situations.                                            NASA calls a spacewalk an ""Extra-Vehicular Activity"",                      or  EVA . Each of the EVA servicing                      periods is an EVA Day, although these ""days"" span two ""Flight                      Days"". For example, EVA Day 1 begins two days and 19 hours                      into the mission, and it ends in the second hour of the third                      mission day.

Shortly                       after launch, the Space Telescope Operations Control Center                       ( STOCC ) team will begin                       transitioning the telescope from normal science operations                       to a ""ready for servicing"" condition. They will command Hubble                       to its capture attitude and configure it for rendezvous with                       Discovery.                       In                       preparation for capture and berthing, the STOCC will instruct                       Hubble's aperture door to close and the high gain antennas                       to be stowed. Immediately after the astronauts install the                       new equipment, they will move to a safe location. Then, the                       STOCC will test the hardware to determine if more work is                       needed. Later, while the crew sleeps, the STOCC team will                       perform more detailed checkouts. Finally, at the mission's                       end, ground controllers will prepare Hubble for its return                       to normal operations.

It simultaneously                       shows all major work performed by the astronauts and the ground                       controllers. The timeline also includes several time measures                       (mission elapsed time, orbit number, UT, etc.), the position                       of the Shuttle and Hubble, and the astronauts' sleep time.                       The servicing team relies on this script-like schedule to                       track mission progress.

NASA Spacelink Home     The Library     NASA Projects     Human Exploration and Development of Space     Human Space Flight     Shuttle     Shuttle Missions     Flight 052 STS-53    MCC Status Reports       MCC Status Reports   ------------------------------[92-12-02]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #1 Mission Control Center  Wednesday, Dec. 2, 1992, 9:30 a.m. CST   The Space Shuttle Discovery lifted off at 7:24 a.m.  JSC time today after a lengthy hold at the T-9 minute mark in the countdown to allow the sun to melt ice that had formed on Discovery's external tank and to analyze upper-level wind data from a weather balloon sent up at 6:26 a.m.  CST.  The countdown went smoothly with no technical problems encountered.  The ascent phase of the STS-53 mission was near-perfect with only one minor sensor failure noted.  A sensor on the Shuttle's center main engine gave an erroneous low-pressure reading, but correct data was available from other sensors in the same area.  Discovery's payload bay doors were opened a few minutes after 9 this morning and the crew was given a ""go"" for orbit operations.  Air-to-ground communications broadcasts are disconnected for the classified Department of Defense payload operations.  During the primary payload operations, television transmissions from Mission Control are restricted to the world map and public affairs mission commentary will be limited to Orbiter, systems and crew status updates.  Standard transmission of air-to-ground communications and mission commentary will resume when primary payload operations are completed later today.  Discovery is in a 200 nautical mile orbit around Earth at a 57-degree inclination.  All systems aboard the spacecraft are performing normally.  ------------------------------[92-12-02a]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #2 MISSION CONTROL CENTER  Wednesday, December 2, 1992, 5 p.m. CST  Discovery is orbiting Earthin flawless shape with the crew -- Commander Dave Walker, Pilot Bob Cabana, and Mission Specialists Guy Bluford, Jim Voss and Rich Clifford -- winding down their first day in space.  The crew deployed the DOD-1 payload on time at 1:18 p.m.  CST today.  All activities proceeded exactly as planned.  Later, the crew began activating several secondary experiments aboard Discovery, including the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor, or CREAM, and the Radiation Monitoring Equipment, or RME, two devices that make complementary measurements of the amounts of radiation in the crew cabin.  The crew also began a series of medical tests performed on many shuttle flights to study the effects of weightlessness on humans.  The two tests performed today photographed the retina in the eye and measured pressure within the eye.  Discovery's crew will go to sleep at 6:24 p.m.  CST and awaken at 2:24 a.m. CST tomorrow to begin their second day in space.  Discovery remains in a 200 nautical mile high circular orbit.  ------------------------------[92-12-03]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #3 Mission Control Center   Thursday, December 3, 1992, 6:30 a.m. CST  Discovery's crew was awakened to begin its second day in space by the Singing Dogs barking the tune to ""Jingle Bells."" The song was played in honor of the five crew members, affectionately named the ""Dog Crew.""  Overnight, flight controllers prepared messages and changes to the crew's flight plan that will be used througout the day.  Much of the work centers around three experiments: BLAST, FARE and HERCULES.  The Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test or BLAST, will use a laser receiver to detect laser energy from ground-based test locations to help in developing Department of Defense sensor technology.  FARE stands for Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Equipment and will investigate the dynamics of fluid transfer in the microgravity environment of space.  Data collected during the STS-53 mission will hopefully help scientists better understand how to replenish on-board fluids and prolong the life of space vehicles such as Space Station Freedom, satellites and extended duration orbiters.  Crew members will use a modified camera to more precisely determine the latitude and longitude of various features on the Earth as part of the HERCULES experiment.  Flying for the first time, this experiment was developed to provide an observation system for military, environmental, oceanographic and meteorological applications.  Discovery's systems are performing very well allowing the crew the time to devote its full attention to the payloads on board.  The orbiter is presently circling the Earth every 92 minutes at an altitude of 200 nautical miles.  Later today the orbit will be lowered to 175 nautical miles to protect the daylight landing opportunities and prepare for release of the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres on Friday.  ------------------------------[92-12-03a]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STS-53 STATUS REPORT #4  Thursday, December 3, 1992, noon CST   The Discovery crew members, now midway through their second day in space, spent the morning working with several experiments and making observations of the Earth from their high-inclination 57-degree orbit.  On this 15th flight of the Orbiter Discovery, the crew began the Flight Day 2 activities by activating the HERCULES experiment, a modified camera system designed to enable an astronaut to more precisely determine the latitude and longitude of various features on the Earth as they are being photographed from space.  This is the first flight of HERCULES, an experiment designed by scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. as part of a joint NASA/Navy/Army project.  Sites observed this morning included Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas, Minch Peninsula in Denmark and Galveston Island, Texas.  The Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test or BLAST, will use a laser receiver to detect laser energy from ground-based test locations to help in developing Department of Defense sensor technology.  The two BLAST opportunities during the crew's morning shift were unsuccessful due to problems at ground sites.  FARE, a third experiment the crew worked with today, stands for Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Equipment and is intended to investigate the dynamics of fluid transfer in the microgravity environment of space.  Data collected during the STS-53 mission may help scientists better understand how to replenish on-board fluids and prolong the life of space vehicles such as Space Station Freedom, satellites and extended duration orbiters.  ------------------------------[92-12-03b]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #5 Mission Control Status Report   Thursday, December 3, 1992, 5 p.m. CST   Discovery's crew lowered the spacecraft's orbit by about 40 statute miles this afternoon in preparation for tomorrow's release of six Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres from the cargo bay.  The ODERACS spheres are in two sets, one solid stainless steel and one solid aluminum.  Three spheres, two-, four-, and six-inch diameters, are in each set. The six spheres will be released from Discovery about 5:22 a.m.  CST Thursday and will be tracked by radars worldwide to assist in fine-tuning the methods used to track space debris.  This afternoon the crew wrapped up the day's work with two test runs of the Fluid Aquisition and Resupply Experiment, or FARE, an investigation in new methods of transporting fluids in wieghtlessness from tank to tank without large amounts of gas bubbles.  The technology being explored may prove useful in the designs of propellant tanks and other fluid systems aboard future spacecraft and Space Station Freedom to allow refueling in space.  Two engine firings were accomplished exactly as planned by the crew to drop Discovery from a 200 nautical mile orbit to its present 175 nautical mile orbit in preparation for tomorrow's release of the ODERACS spheres.  Discovery is now circling Earth every 90 minutes and zero seconds.  The crew will go to sleep at 6:24 p.m.  CST and awaken at 2:24 a.m.  CST tomorrow to start their third day in orbit.  ------------------------------[92-12-04]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #6 MISSION CONTROL CENTER  Friday, December 4, 1992, 7 a.m. CST  Discovery's crew will wait for a second attempt to deploy six stainless steel and aluminum balls after a glitch postponed today's ejection of the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres.  Discovery's crew awoke at 2:30 this morning and quickly began their work with the secondary payloads.  The six ODERACS spheres -- two each of the six-, four- and two- inch in diameter balls -- were scheduled to be released from a small canister mounted in the orbiter's payload bay at about 5:20 this morning. However, about 10 minutes before the 20-minute deploy window, crew members reported they were not getting good signals through the deploy mechanism electronics.  After plugging in the hand- held controller at a second location and checking switch positions, the expected electronics readouts were not received.  Flight controllers are assessing the electrical pathways.  The next opportunity to deploy the six spheres could come on Sunday evening.  During their third day in space, the crew is scheduled to work with several other experiments including the BLAST, FARE and HERCULES payloads.  The Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test or BLAST, uses a laser receiver to detect laser energy from ground-based test locations to help in developing Department of Defense sensor technology.  FARE stands for Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Equipment and will investigate fluid transfer in the microgravity environment of space.  Data collected may assist scientists to understand how to replenish or transfer fluids in space and prolong the life of space vehicles such as Space Station Freedom, satellites and extended duration orbiters.  Crew members will use a modified camera to more precisely determine the latitude and longitude of various features on the Earth as part of the HERCULES experiment.  This experiment was developed to provide an observation system for military, environmental, oceanographic and meteorological applications.  Discovery is now circling Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of 175 nautical miles.  ------------------------------[92-12-04a]------------------------------ Mission Control Center STS-53 Status Report #7  Friday, December 4, 1992, 1:30 p.m. CST  Payload operations continued aboard the Orbiter Discovery today as vehicle and crew entered a third flight day on orbit.  The day began with an unsuccessful attempt to deploy six small metal spheres for the ODERACS experiment.  ODERACS, which stands for Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres, is intended to provide targets for use by ground radar sites to hone their ability to track orbital debris.  As the crew neared the intended deploy time, they found that the controller used to send commands to the payload was not receiving the expected feedback from the ODERACS cannister.  After trying several configurations, Mission Control opted not to attempt the deploy because without feedback from the payload, the current state of the experiment could not be determined and commands sent to the equipment could not be verified.  Mission Control is continuing to analyze and trouble shoot the problem.  The next opportunity to attempt the ODERACS sphere deploys will come on Sunday afternoon.  Meanwhile, all of the other secondary payloads are up and operating aboard Discovery.  Also on Friday, the five crew members recorded a short video message which may be aired during the annual Army-Navy game on Saturday.  The Discovery continues to operate nearly flawlessly and is circling the Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of about 175 nautical miles.  ------------------------------[92-12-04b]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STS-53 Status Report #8  Friday, December 4, 1992, 6 p.m. CST  Discovery's crew completed a busy day of experiments using the HERCULES camera, to automatically imprint the location being photographed on the film, and excercising on a rowing machine in the spacecraft's middeck.  Earlier today, the crew - two in the Army, two in the Navy, and one in the Air Force - sent down greetings for participants in the annual Army-Navy football game to be held this weekend.  In Mission Control flight controllers continued to evaluate problems experienced during this morning's attempt to deploy the orbital debris and calibration system spheres, six metal balls to be released from Discovery's cargo bay to help fine tune ground based radars that track space junk.  A release of the spheres was ruled out when information that was supposed to be relayed from the deploy equipment in the cargo bay was not received in Discovery's crew cabin.  This afternoon the crew checked connections in the cabin using an electrical test meter that is part of the standard Shuttle tool kit and relayed their findings to Mission Control. Payload controllers will continue to evaluate the problems and possible solutions, and the earliest another attempt to deploy the spheres could be tried is around 5 p.m.  CST, Sunday, December 6, 1992. Shuttle managers are expected to continue an evaluation of the possibility of attempting another release for the next few days.  Discovery's crew will go to sleep today at 7:24 p.m.  CST and awaken for their fourth day in space tomorrow at 3:24 a.m.  CST. The spacecraft is in a 175 nautical mile orbit, circling the earth every ninty minutes, fifty-two seconds.  ------------------------------[92-12-05]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL STATUS REPORT #9 6 a.m. CST   Saturday, December 5, 1992   In honor of Commander Dave Walker, the sound of bagpipes awakened the crew of Discovery to begin its fourth day in space.  The medley was performed by the Houston Highlanders Pipe Band (Medley: Bonnie Dundee, Gary Green and The Eyes of Texas).  Once awake, the crew began work on several of the secondary experiments including BLAST, FARE, HERCULES and GCP.  The Battlefield Laser Acquisition Test is an Army space project that uses a spaceborne laser receiver to detect laser energy from ground-based test locations.  Data obtained will be used to develop Department of Defense sensor technology.  Thus far the experiment has been hampered by poor weather conditions at the various ground sites.  Crew members will continue work with the Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Equipment investigating the transfer of fluids from one container to another in hopes of developing the technology to prolong the life of space vehicles such as Space Station Freedom, satellites and long-duration flights aboard the Shuttle.  The equipment called HERCULES is designed to pinpoint locations on the Earth's surface using a modified camera system that can find locations within about two nautical miles.  Hopes are that a system similar to this can be used as a valuable tool in more precisely locating military troops or environmental, oceanographic and meteorological points of interest.  The Shuttle Glow/Cryogenic Heat Pipe Experiment or GCP continues to gather data for scientists on Shuttle surface interaction with atomic oxygen as well as testing advanced ways of removing excess heat from sensors, instruments and space vehicles.  The heat pipe is a simple, but dependable way of rejecting heat away from instruments by using liquids to absorb heat and then releasing that heat to space when the liquids condense.  Flight controllers continue to evaluate the problem preventing deploy of the six calibration spheres in support of the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration System. The deploy was put off when data that was supposed to be relayed from the equipment in the payload bay was not received on the flight deck of Discovery during Friday's release attempt.  The next opportunity to release the spheres is about 5 p.m. tomorrow.  Discovery's 15th flight continues to go smoothly as the orbiter and crew circle the Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of 175 nautical miles.  Landing remains scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in Florida or California.  ------------------------------[92-12-05a]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #10 4pm CST   Saturday, December 5, 1992 Mission Control Center   The five man military crew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery continued their work with a variety of science and technology investigations on behalf of the Department of Defense and NASA today.  The crew conducted a number of successful observations and data takes with the HERCULES electronic still imaging device, locating and documenting precise targets on the ground below.  The system produces an electronic image of the ground target and correlates the latitude and longitude of it's position on the globe.  In a pretaped television broadcast, the crew also demonstrated the transfer of fluids from one container to another in microgravity.  The experiment, called FARE, is designed to investigate the dynamics of fueling spacecraft in orbit and should provide valuable information for the design of fueling systems for the Space Station and other extended duration spacecraft.  The decision was made today not to pursue the deployment of the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration Spheres any further.  The deployment was halted yesterday, when the experiment, located in a canister in the payload bay, failed to communicate with the payload controller on the flight deck of Discovery. After extensive review of all available data, including manufacturing and processing records, it was determined that the likely cause is a dead battery - however it will be impossible to verify that theory until the hardware is returned to the investigators.  Throughout the early afternoon, flight controllers in Houston, kept the military crew well informed of the progress of the traditional annual Army/Navy football game.  Discovery's all-military crew consists of two Army officers, one Navy, one Marine, and one Air Force officer.    ------------------------------[92-12-06]------------------------------ STS-53 MISSION CONTROL STATUS REPORT #11 6 A.M. CST Sunday, Dec. 6, 1992   The United States Air Force theme song awoke Colonel Guy Bluford and the rest of Discovery's crew to begin their fifth day in space.  Today they will continue work with several of the secondary experiments including BLAST, FARE, HERCULES and GCP. The Battlefield Laser Acquisition Test is an Army space project designed to use a spaceborne laser receiver to detect laser energy from ground-based test locations.  FARE, or Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Equipment investigates the transfer of fluids from one container to another in hopes of developing the technology to prolong the life of space vehicles on long missions, such as Space Station Freedom. HERCULES pinpoints locations on the Earth using a modified camera system that can find locations within about two nautical miles to more precisely locate military troops or environmental, oceanographic and meteorological points of interest.  The Shuttle Glow/Cryogenic Heat Pipe Experiment or GCP continues to gather data for scientists on orbiter surface interaction with atomic oxygen and also on testing advanced ways of removing excess heat from space vehicles.  Also today, the crew will participate in a press conference with news media located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The press conference is scheduled to begin at 1:39 p.m.  CST.  Discovery is performing exceptionally well as it circles the Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of 175 nautical miles, allowing the crew to devote its full attention to the experiments on board.  ------------------------------[92-12-06a]------------------------------ STS-53 MCC Report #12 3 p.m. CST Sunday, December 6, 1992  The Discovery crew continued a variety of scientific and engineering studies on their fifth day in space and also took time out to speak with reporters in a press conference from low Earth orbit.  Meanwhile, with an eye on marginal landing weather predictions for mid-week, Mission Control asked the crew to perform a power-down of non-critical equipment to save electricity.  This will add to Discovery's power margins in the event that a landing waveoff is required, but Mission Control has made no decision to extend the flight and all planning is centered on a nominal end of mission with a Wednesday landing.  ""We'd like to bank some cryo margin,"" spacecraft communicator Sam Gemar explained to the crew Sunday afternoon.  The amount of electricity available aboard a Space Shuttle is directly tied to the amount of supercold (or cryogenic) hydrogen and oxygen stored in tanks located beneath the cargo bay. Those tanks supply cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen to the three fuel cells, which employ a chemical reaction to produce all of the electrical power the vehicle uses in flight.  The hydrogen and oxygen are stored in their respective tanks at cryogenic temperatures and supercritical pressures.  The storage temperature for liquid oxygen is minus 285 degrees F and the temperature for the liquid hydrogen is minus 420 degrees F. The powerdown performed by the Discovery crew will lower the rate at which those fuels are used to produce electricity. Mission Control estimated the powerdown would account for a savings of about 1.6 Kilowatts below the normal usage.  During their press conference, Commander Dave Walker reflected on Discovery's 15th flight, the first since a major overhaul was performed on the orbiter earlier this year. ""As an old Navy guy, I've taken ships out of the yard before, but never one in better shape than Discovery,"" Walker said.   ------------------------------[92-12-07]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STATUS REPORT #13   Monday, December 7, 1992, 7 a.m. CST    ""Anchor's Aweigh"" was played for crew members Dave Walker and Bob Cabana, both graduates of the U. S. Naval Academy, as the STS-53 crew began their sixth flight day in space.  Much of the planned crew day involves work with the many site acquisition and life sciences projects being flown aboard Discovery.  In addition to continued operations with the secondary experiments by Mission Specialists Guy Bluford, Jim Voss and Rich Clifford, routine pre-landing orbiter checkouts will be conducted in preparation for Wednesday's planned return to Earth.  Walker and Cabana will make sure the vehicle's flight control surfaces on the wings and tail are in proper working order for the landing phase when the spacecraft begins entering the atmosphere.  The two also will fire all of the small thruster jets in the nose and tail to ensure they are ready for the entry phase.  The checkout is scheduled to begin about 10 this morning.  Checking out the orbiter systems is usually done the day before landing, but was moved up to ensure uninterrupted data gathering in support of the orbiter glow experiment on Tuesday, the first day that the orbiter will actually pass into darkness due to the time of launch last week.  After the FCS checkout and RCS hotfire, a small eight foot per second burn of one of the orbital maneuvering system engines also will be performed today to add a second landing opportunity on Thursday at the Kennedy Space Center should weather conditions delay landing until then.  The orbit adjust burn is scheduled for 1:15 CST this afternoon.   All systems aboard Discovery continue to perform well on its fifteenth mission.  The latest projected landing time for Wednesday's opportunity at KSC is 1:16 p.m.  Central completing the 114th orbit.  ------------------------------[92-12-07a]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STS-53 Status Report #14  Monday, December 7, 1992, 3 p.m. CST  It was a busy morning for the Discovery crew as they continued with payload operations and performed a series of tests that verified the vehicle's readiness to return to Earth Wednesday.  Today's activities included a Flight Control System checkout.  This test is conducted to check out mechanical and hydraulic systems which are required for landing.  The FCS checkout also tests various displays and sensors the crew will use during the entry.  Later in the morning, the crew conducted a Reaction Control System hot fire test, which is a test of various thrusters and of the plumbing and other mechanisms associated with that system.  Following the crew's midday meal, a fifth orbital maneuvering system burn was performed to lower Discovery's orbit and set up the geometry that will provide an extra landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center on Thursday. The orbital adjustment was performed to maximize Discovery's landing options given marginal weather forecasts for each of the three Shuttle landing sites in the United States.  NASA still plans to bring Discovery home to Kennedy Space Center at the nominal time on Wednesday with a deorbit burn at 12:16 p.m.  CST and a landing at 1:16 p.m.  CST.  The orbiter systems continue to function very well with only minor problems reported on this 15th flight of the vehicle.  ------------------------------[92-12-08]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STS-53 STATUS REPORT # 15   Tuesday, December 8, 1992, 6:30 a.m. CST   In honor of Army Lieutenant Colonels Jim Voss and Rich Clifford aboard Discovery, ""Caissons Go Rolling Along"" by Bob Sharples and His Military Band was played as the morning wake up call.   Most of the crew's schedule today involves data gathering using the Arizona Imaging Spectrograph mounted in the payload bay as part of the orbiter glow experiment when Discovery is on the dark side of the Earth. Commander Dave Walker and Pilot Bob Cabana will fire the onboard thruster jets to create air glow around the nose and tail of the Discovery for the experiment.  The AIS will also collect data as the fuel cells are purged and the supply water is dumped overboard -- both routine operations aboard the spacecraft each day.   Now that Discovery's mechanical systems have been checked for the return home tomorrow, Guy Bluford and the rest of the STS-53 crew will spend the latter part of the day deactivating experiments and stowing equipment in the cabin.   The latest weather forecast for the two landing opportunities at the Kennedy Space Center calls for scattered clouds and good visibility with light winds out of the southeast.  Should all remain on schedule, the crew will fire Discovery's orbital maneuvering system engines about 12:16 CST tomorrow afternoon dropping the spaceplane out of orbit for the hour-long glide to Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility runway.  Landing is set for 1 :16 p.m.  Central.   Flight controllers made minimal changes to the crew's schedule today and are tracking no systems problems on the orbiter as it circles the Earth every 91 minutes at an altitude of 175 nautical miles.  ------------------------------[92-12-08a]------------------------------ STS-53 Status Report #16 MISSION CONTROL CENTER   Tuesday, December 8, 1992, 5:30 p.m. CST  Discovery's crew finished their experimental work today and stowed their gear in anticipation of a return home tomorrow.  All of the experiments aboard Discovery met their objectives during the flight except for the Orbital Debris Radar Calibration System, or ODERACS, spheres, which were not released as planned due to a power problem in their cargo bay canister.  The metal spheres may now be scheduled for release from a March 1993 shuttle flight.  Today, the crew stowed the Fluid Aquisition and Resupply Equipment, or FARE, after completing an eighth and final run of the experiment, which studies how to move fluids from tank to tank in weightlessness without creating bubbles. FARE could aid in developing technology to refuel Space Station Freedom. After taking more than 200 photos, eight times as many as required, the crew stowed the HERCULES camera, a specially adapted camera designed to automatically imprint the latitude and longitude of the subject photographed on the film when the picture is taken.  The crew stowed the Battlefield Laser Aquisition Sensor Test, or BLAST, after completing the 20 required attempts with the device, designed to send position information from a ground laser beam to a receiver in the shuttle window.  Hoped to lead to a future technology that a field soldier or downed pilot could use to secretly send his position to an overhead satellite, BLAST was received twice by the shuttle.  The other attempts were thwarted by bad weather, ground problems or will require more analysis after landing.  In the cargo bay, the Orbiter Glow Experiment, or GLO, is continuing to study the fluorescent effect created as the shuttle encounters atomic oxygen in orbit.  By the time it is finished prior to landing tomorrow, GLO will have completed 20 of the 23 planned studies.  GLO's studies involved watching the glowing effect as it is intensified by various steering jet firings, water dumps and orientations of Discovery. Also in the cargo bay, the Cryogenic Heat Pipe Experiment, or CRYO H P, a study of a new cooling system with no moving parts that may be used in future spacecraft, completed a number of test runs in excess of what had been planned.  Other experiments -- two studying radiation in the shuttle cabin, called CREAM and RME; one studying cloud formations by photography called CLOUDS; one studying the effect of weightlessness on human body tissue, called STL or Space Tissue Loss; and one studying the composition of tiny timed-release medication capsules manufactured aboard Discovery, called MIS -- all went as planned and are now stowed.  In addition the crew has completed many standard medical tests performed on every shuttle flight that study the effect of weightlessness on the body. Today, the crew will go to sleep at 8:54 p.m. central and awaken at 4:54 a.m. Wednesday. The crew will start preparations to leave orbit at about 8:11 a.m. central; close Discovery's cargo bay doors at about 9:30 a.m.; and fire the engines to begin a freefall to Earth at 12:11 p.m., aiming for a touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, shuttle runway at 1:16 p.m. central time.  At present, the weather forecast for Kennedy is favorable for landing, however, there is a possibility it could deteriorate.  If so, flight controllers would likely choose to attempt a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at about 2:44 p.m.  CST Wednesday.  If weather proved poor at both locations, Discovery could easily stay in space an extra day and flight controllers would lilely aim for a landing at Edwards at about 2:59 p.m.  CST Thursday.  After almost seven days in space, Discovery remains in excellent mechanical condition, circling Earth every one hour, 31 minutes in an orbit with a high point of 174 nautical miles and a low point of 170 nautical miles.  -end-   ------------------------------[92-12-09]------------------------------ MISSION CONTROL CENTER STS-53 STATUS REPORT #17   Wednesday, December 9, 1992, 7:30 a.m. CST   The Marine Corps Hymn awoke Discovery's five-member crew to prepare for the trip home after seven days in space.  With weather conditions appearing to be favorable this morning, the crew will pilot Discovery through a deorbit burn and hour-long glide back to Earth, landing at the Kennedy Space Center at 1:16 this afternoon central time completing 115 orbits around the world.  Before going to bed last night, the crew performed a small two foot-per-second thruster jet burn to avoid a piece of space debris.  The collision avoidance maneuver did not impact the landing time today.  With all of the payload activity completed aboard the orbiter, the crew will transition from its on-orbit flight plan to the deorbit preparation timeline about 8:15 this morning before closing the payload bay doors at 9:30.  Once strapped into their seats, Discovery's crew will manuever the orbiter and fire the twin orbital maneuvering system engines just after noon for the final glide across the central United States on the way to the landing at the launch site on Florida's east coast.  Weather forecasters predict only scattered clouds and moderate winds at KSC at the time of landing.  Some lower clouds offshore are not expected to impact today's landing opportunities.  ------------------------------[END]------------------------------          Can't find what you're looking for?

GX070-18-2661377	Did you know that    one in every ten people that travel by plane have been bumped off a flight in    the past year?  People in the United States are bumped most frequently because    of overbooking.  Here is some information about what you can do and what you    can expect if you are bumped off a flight.        There      are two types of bumping; voluntary and involuntary.  With voluntary bumping      the airline asks for volunteers and they give you free air miles or even a      free flight coupon in return for your seat.  Once you give up your seat you      have to wait for the next available flight.  You may be offered an alternate      flight that will depart soon after your original flight, but you could wait      longer.  The airlines might also offer to put you on standby, which could      leave you stranded at the airport for awhile.     There are some      guidelines for airlines that give compensation to people who voluntarily give      up their seats.  Before you give up your seat there are some questions that      you might want to ask of yourself and the airline.           When will        the alternate flight depart?                 If you end        up waiting six hours for a flight, will you be on time to your destination?                        Is it really        worth waiting in an airport for the rest of the day or staying overnight        to get a free flight?                 Will the airline        provide food, hotel room and ground transportation to and from the hotel?         (If the airline does not offer accommodations you might end up paying for        them yourself.)           There      may be a negative side of giving up your seat.  Since the DOT airline requirements      for voluntary bumping are limited, airlines are able to negotiate with the      passengers for compensation.  If you are offered a free trip by the airline,      make sure to ask about restrictions.     Another form      of bumping is involuntary.  The DOT requires airlines to compensate people      who have been bumped against their will as a result of overbooking.  The DOT      also requires airlines to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written      statement.  This will explain your passenger rights.  This written statement      will also explain how the airline chooses who gets bumped and who doesn't.       Frequent flyers are entitled to immediate payment of denied boarding compensation.      If you are not a frequent flyer there are many requirements for compensation.       They are as follows:           Compensation        depends on the price of the tickets and the length of the delay.                 There is no        compensation if you are scheduled to reach your destination within one hour        of the original time by way of an alternate flight.                           If the alternate flight        will arrive between one and two hours of the original time, you will be        paid the amount equal to one-fare; the maximum is $200.                   If the delay will        be more than two hours, your compensation may double to a maximum of $400.         You should always keep your original ticket for use at a later date.           Even though the      process of getting bumped sounds likes a good plan to get a free trip, there      are a few loopholes involved.  You must confirm your reservation to be eligible      for compensation.  You must also meet the deadline for buying your ticket      and for checking in at the airline.  Remember, these rules do not apply to      charter flights.        If you do not      want to get bumped because you need to get to your destination on time, you      must arrive early and check in at your airline.  Always remember to confirm      your reservation so you will be eligible for compensation in case you are      involuntarily bumped.                                      Back            to Transportation                            HOME                                                                                            Links                                  Airline            Passenger Rights           Airline            Accessibility

The vessel had sunk, and the four people onboard     were adrift in a life raft when a Navy helicopter from Naval     Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, came to their aid. The     four people were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to the     Naval base.        As the vessel sank, its 406     MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was activated.     The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA     notified the Coast Guard.        The U.S. Coast Guard's Rescue     Sub-Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contacted all agencies in     the area requesting air support for a long-range offshore flight,     but no aircraft were immediately available. San Juan RSC then     contacted Coast Guard District 7 in Miami for additional air     support. A Coast Guard C-130 Hercules (CG1712) was airborne in     the Windward Pass and was diverted to the scene with about eight     hours left of flight time. The aircraft received a strong signal     from the 121.5 MHz homer in the EPIRB, and was able to home in     on the life raft with the four persons on board. The C-130 deployed     a small survival pack to the stranded sailors until they could     be rescued.        San Juan RSC again contacted     Navy Helicopter Squadron VC-8 in Roosevelt Roads and was told     that an H-3 Search and Rescue helicopter was now available. After     a two- hour flight from Puerto Rico, the H-3 arrived on scene     and hoisted the four sailors from the life raft. None of the     rescued was reported to have any serious injuries. The cause     of the sinking is yet unknown, but weather conditions were reported     to be less than favorable with winds around 25 knots and four-to-five-foot     seas.        The crew of the sailing vessel     said they are thankful their emergency beacon saved the day.     In an emergency, the equipment can mean the difference between     life and death.        ""The Search and Rescue     program is truly an international humanitarian program,""     said Ajay Mehta, manager of NOAA's Sarsat program. ""This     particular rescue illustrates the international aspect of the     program. The vessel was registered with the United Kingdom and     three of the people rescued were from Great Britain, the fourth     was from Spain. Yet, U.S. search and rescue teams joined together     to come to the aid of these individuals.""        The Cospas-Sarsat system uses     a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits     to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft     in distress. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and     Information Service (NOAA Satellite and Data Service) represents     the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms     and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control     Center.        NOAA's Geostationary Operational     Environmental Satellites ( GOES )     can instantly detect emergency signals. The  polar-orbiting     satellites  in the system detect emergency signals as they     circle the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent     to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's Satellite and Data     Service in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces     around the world. Today there are 35 countries participating     in the system. More than 13,000 lives have been saved worldwide     since the system became operational in 1982 and more than 4,500     in the United States alone. September of this year marks the     20th anniversary of the first Sarsat rescue.        NOAA's     Satellite and Data Service      is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological     and climate data. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service operates     the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for weather     forecasting, climate monitoring, and other environmental applications     such as fire detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature     measurements. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service also operates     three data centers, which house global data bases in climatology,     oceanography, solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics,     solar-terrestrial physics, and paleoclimatology.

GX009-09-15917710	"In the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility, members of the STS-103   crew get instructions on use of rib clamps for the Shield Shell   Replacement Fabric (SSRF) task on repair of the Hubble Space   Telescope. The seven-member crew are Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr.,   Pilot Scott J. Kelly, and Mission Specialists Steven L. Smith,   C. Michael Foale (Ph.D.), John M. Grunsfeld (Ph.D.), Claude Nicollier   of Switzerland, and Jean-Frangois Clervoy of France. Nicollier and   Clervoy are with the European Space Agency. Mission STS-103 is a   ""call-up"" due to the need to replace portions of the pointing system,   the gyros, which have begun to fail on the Hubble Space   Telescope. Although Hubble is operating normally and conducting its   scientific observations, only three of its six gyroscopes are working   properly. The gyroscopes allow the telescope to point at stars,   galaxies and planets. The STS-103 crew will not only replace   gyroscopes, it will also replace a Fine Guidance Sensor, an older   computer with a new enhanced model, an older data tape recorder with a   solid state digital recorder, a failed spare transmitter with a new   one, and degraded insulation on the telescope with new thermal   insulation. The crew will also install a Battery Voltage/Temperature   Improvement Kit to protect the spacecraft batteries from overcharging   and overheating when the telescope goes into a safe mode. The   scheduled launch date in October is under review.

GX010-67-5301528	"Frequent Flyer           Benefits and Bumping           The definition of         Government property includes ""any right or other intangible         interest that is purchased with Government funds."" That means any         promotional benefit that you receive in connection with a purchase paid         for by Government funds is Government property and may not be converted         to your personal use.           This rule applies to         frequent flyer miles and frequent guest benefits received in connection         with official travel. It also applies, however, to promotional benefits         received in connection with any Government procurement.                     Example: Your administrative         or procurement officer signs an order to purchase 50 boxes of photocopy paper from a     supplier whose literature advertises that it will give a     free briefcase to anyone who purchases 50 or more boxes.     Because the paper         is purchased with Government funds, the     administrative or         procurement officer cannot keep the briefcase which,     if claimed and received, is Government property.                     Frequent         Flyer Mileage           Frequent flyer miles accumulated on official business         are Government property. You cannot use those benefits for         personal travel. If you do a lot of both personal and         official travel with the same airline, it’s a good idea for you to have two         separate frequent flyer accounts with that airline -- one for your         personal travel, the other for your official travel. That simplifies         accounting for you and helps you stay out of trouble. The same         restrictions apply to frequent guest benefits at hotels.           Some         airlines might not permit you to establish two separate frequent flyer         accounts with them. If that is the case, then you will have the burden         of keeping separate records of official and personal frequent flyer         miles. If your use of official frequent flyer miles is ever         investigated, it will be very important for you to have accurate and         complete records to show that the use of the official miles has been         proper.           People have been prosecuted and convicted for                         redeeming travel benefits accumulated on                         official travel for personal travel tickets for                         themselves and their family.             Bumping         from Overbooked Flight           What are your rights when         you are bumped off an overbooked flight during official         travel?  It depends on whether you are bumped involuntarily, or         whether you volunteered to be bumped. If you volunteered to be bumped,         your action may not interfere with performance of your official duties         and may not cause any added cost to the Government. Here's a chart to help you understand the         differences between voluntary and involuntary bumping.                                                                                                                               Voluntary Bumping                               Involuntary Bumping                                                                     Travel Status                   Not official travel status               Official travel status                                                                Expenses                   Can't claim on travel voucher               Can claim on travel voucher                                                                Other Benefits (meals, lodging,               transportation)                   May accept               May accept but must reduce official               travel claim accordingly                                                                Mileage Credits (as compensation               for bumping)                   Can accept and use on personal trips               Can accept but mileage belongs to               Government                                                    Example:  It’s Saturday and you’re in the Los Angles airport         ready to go back to Washington. Your next duty day is Monday. Then you         hear an announcement that your flight is overbooked! The airline is         looking for volunteers to give up their seats on the flight. If you         volunteer to be bumped, the airline will guarantee you a seat on the         following day’s flight. The airline         will also pay for your meals and lodging for the extra 24 hours in Los         Angles. To sweeten the pot, the airline is offering you additional frequent         flyer miles. You are strongly tempted.          Can you volunteer to be bumped and later use the mileage credits to take         a vacation? Yes. You may volunteer to be bumped, as long as this         does not interfere with the performance of official duties and does not         result in additional cost to the Government. During the 24-hour delay in         Los Angles, you are not in an official travel status, and you may not         claim any expenses on your travel voucher for that period. You may         accept the free meals and lodging from the airline. Finally, you may         also accept the frequent flyer miles as compensation to you and use them         for personal travel, because you were not in official travel status at         the time they were earned.                     However, if you are bumped involuntarily, the situation is quite         different. You may accept the benefits BUT with significant limitations         since you are on official travel as an involuntary ""bumpee."" You may claim         expenses for that period on your travel voucher. You may choose to         accept the meals and lodging offered by the airline. If you do, then you         must reduce your claim for official travel expenses accordingly on your         voucher. The free meals and lodging from the airline are compensation to         the Government, not to you. Lastly, you can  not  use the frequent         flyer credits for personal trips. Because you remain on official travel         status when you are bumped involuntarily, those frequent flyer credits         belong to the Government.            Reference:           41 CFR         310-53(5); 5 CFR 2635.704, 2635.204(c)(3)                                                   HOME    |            ETHICS CONTENTS    |            TOP OF PAGE    |    HELP                                                    INFORMATION                  |  CONDUCT  |  THREATS  |  TECH                 VULNERABILITY  |  ASSISTANCE                   SPY STORIES  |  TREASON                 101                                                 Link back to the  Western Region Security Office  home page.

GX261-94-4852998	"CONTACT: Patricia Viets, NOAA (301) 457-5005  NOAA 02-301 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Jan. 10, 2002  NOAA Satellites Help Save Six Fishermen from Atlantic Ocean Six fishermen were rescued from the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles off the coast of North Carolina recently, thanks to environmental satellites in the international Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program, Cospas-Sarsat. Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government detected a distress signal from the 53-foot fishing vessel Mediterranean Sea II Jan. 6 . The crew was airlifted by Coast Guard Search and Rescue teams. The vessel, 50 miles southeast of Cape Fear, had electrical and engine room fires, and was without electricity and engine power in rough seas. A large wave hit the bow of the ship and destroyed the windscreen on the bridge. The vessel was taking on water. The crew manually activated their 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding on the vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard. ""While the cause of the incident is not yet known, six lives were saved by the use of properly working safety gear such as an EPIRB and lifejackets. With the EPIRB, we were able to quickly find their location and in this case able to save their lives,"" said LCDR Brendan McPherson, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard Atlantic Area Command, headquartered in Portsmouth, Va. When the Coast Guard received the distress alert from NOAA, a search was started with air crews from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., in an HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, a C-130 Hercules aircraft and an HH-65 Dolphin helicopter from Coast Guard Air Facility Charleston, S.C. -more-2-   The first helicopter on scene was the rescue helicopter from Air Facility Charleston finding the Mediterranean Sea II almost completely submerged and some fishermen jumping into the water. All of the fishermen were wearing survival suits and Personal Flotation Devices. Three fishermen were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to safety. The helicopter from Air Station Elizabeth City arrived shortly and hoisted the three remaining fishermen to safety from 10-15 foot seas, sustained winds of 25 mph, and gusts nearing 50 mph. The fishermen were taken to North Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Airport, N.C., in good condition. The crew of the Mediterranean Sea II, homeported in Little River, S.C., said they are thankful their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment can mean the difference between life and death. The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service represents the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center. NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 30 countries participating in the system. More than 12,000 lives have been saved worldwide since the system became operational in 1982. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA Satellite and Data Service) is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellite and Data Service operates the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA Satellite and Data Service also operates three data centers, which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and paleoclimatology.

America's leadership in aviation and the space program have had an          impact on everyone's life, whether it is in learning more about the          world or the solar system around us or in development of new technology          and products to enhance our quality of life.            Aerospace education can excite young people to learn more about          math, science, technology, history, and other subjects. Lessons which          are deemed boring by school students suddenly take on new meaning and          direction when they are associated with the fascinations of flight and          space.            Civil Air Patrol aerospace education activities are divided into          both internal and external programs.                                                           Internal Program                                                 Internal education efforts include instruction for both cadets and          senior members within the Civil Air Patrol organization.                                                                                           Cadet member training includes learning and testing from a six          chapter text, with topics ranging from history of flight, through flight          principles and operations, to aerospace careers.            Youth members also are involved in an orientation flight program          and other aviation related activities.            Senior members are involved in mission flight training and support          activities, together with training and teaching about aerospace.                                                                                                  External Program                                                 External education includes Civil Air Patrol presentations to          school and community groups, and activities which heighten awareness in          aviation related matters.            During the past 30 years, CAP has supported some 4,000 aerospace          education workshops for teachers and education officials at more than          250 colleges and universities around the country.            These programs have prepared nearly 200,000 educators to teach          aerospace-related courses in their schools and to enrich ordinary          classroom subjects.            Other important services include curriculum planning assistance at          all levels and development of educational materials for use by teachers          in their classrooms.            The Civil Air Patrol Center for Aerospace Education Development          publishes and distributes materials to educators which range from          pamphlets and activity booklets to a complete high school elective          course. These materials are produced and sold at a cost far below          commercially available products.                                                  Cooperative efforts                                                CAP keeps in close contact with education departments at all          levels and with agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration          (FAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the          National Air and Space Museum, and the Air Force Association in order to          promote and expand aerospace education in the nation's schools.            The Civil Air Patrol also sponsors the annual National Congress on          Aviation and Space Education which is designed to assist educators, both          externally and internally, in keeping up to date on current aerospace          activities.            Cadet and senior members of the organization can vie for annual          scholarships which help finance college studies in engineering, the          humanities, education, science and other air and space related fields.

So by the time you read this a few         procedures we explain may be different.            Tenth Revised Edition, September 1994           INTRODUCTION           The elimination of government economic         regulation of the airlines has resulted in lower fares         and a wide variety of price/service options. In this new         commercial environment, consumers have had to take a more         active role in choosing their air service by learning to         ask a number of questions.           -Am I more concerned with price or         scheduling? Am I willing to fly at an odd hour if it         means saving $25?           -Will the airline penalize me for         changing my reservation?           -What will the airline do for me if it         cancels my flight?           This booklet is designed to explain your         rights and responsibilities as an air traveler. We hope         it helps you become a resourceful consumer.           1. AIR FARES           Because of the emphasis on price         competition, consumers may choose from a wide variety of         air fares. Some airlines are trying a ""back to         basics"" approach-offering flights at bargain         basement prices with few extras. For fare information,         you can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or         an airline serving the places you want to visit. Ask them         to tell you the names of all airlines flying there. A         travel agent can find virtually all airlines' fares in         his or her computer. Or, if you prefer you can call each         airline to ask about the fares they charge, particularly         any special promotional fares they may be offering at the         time. You can also pay attention to newspaper and radio         ads, where airlines advertise many of the discount plans         that apply to your city. Finally, be alert to new         companies serving the market. They may offer lower fares         or different services than older established airlines.         Here are some tips to help you decide among air fares:           Be flexible in your travel plans in order         to get the lowest fare. The best deals may be limited to         travel on certain days of the week or particular hours of         the day. After you get a fare quote, ask the reservations         agent if you could save even more by leaving a day         earlier or later, or by taking a different flight on the         same day.            * Plan as far ahead as you can. Some         airlines set aside only a few seats on each flight at the         lower rates. The real bargains often sell out very         quickly. On the other hand, air carriers sometimes make         more discount seats available later. If you had decided         against a trip because the discount fare you wanted was         not available on the desired date, try again, especially         just before the advance-purchase deadline.            * Some airlines may have discounts that         others don't offer. In a large metropolitan area, the         fare could depend on which airport you use. Also, a         connection (change of planes) or a one-stop flight is         sometimes cheaper than a nonstop.            * Does the air fare include types of         service that airlines have traditionally provided, such         as meals or free baggage handling? If you have a         connection involving two airlines, will your bags be         transferred? Can you get advance seat assignments? If you         are stranded, will the ticket be good on another carrier         at no extra charge? Will the first airline pay for meals         or hotel rooms during the wait?            * Many discount fares are non-refundable;         if you buy one of these fares and later cancel your trip,         you will not get your money back. Some fares also have a         penalty for changing flights or dates even if you don't         want a refund. You may also have to pay any difference in         air fares if your fare is not available on the new         flight.            * Some airlines will not increase the         fare after the ticket is issued and paid for. (Simply         holding a reservation without a ticket does not guarantee         the fare.) Other airlines may reserve the right to         collect more money from you if the fare that you had         purchased goes up before departure time. Find out from         the airline before you buy your ticket what its policy is         on assessing fare increases after the ticket is         purchased.            * After you buy your ticket, call the         airline or travel agent once or twice before departure to         check the fare. Fares change all the time, and if that         same fare goes down before you fly, some airlines will         refund the difference. But you have to ask.            Differences in air fares can be         substantial. Careful comparison shopping among airlines         does take time, but it can lead to real savings.           2. RESERVATIONS AND TICKETS           Once you decide when and where you want         to go, and which airline you want to use, getting         reservations and tickets is a fairly simple process. You         can make all of your arrangements by telephone, at the         airline's ticket office, or through a travel agent or         other ticket outlet. There are a few potential pitfalls,         however, and these pointers should help you avoid them.           * If your travel plans fall into a busy         period, call for reservations early. Flights for holidays         may sell out weeks-sometimes months-ahead of time. Don't         buy a standby fare or an 'open return' ticket if you need         to fly during a high-demand period, especially the end of         August. You could be stranded for a week or more before a         seat becomes available.            * Ask the reservations agent to give you         the on-time performance code for any flights that you are         considering. This is a one-digit code in the reservations         computer that shows how often that flight arrived on time         (within 15 minutes) during the most recent reported         month. For example, an ""8"" means that flight         arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time         between 80% and 89.9% of the time. If you are deciding         between two flights with similar schedules and fares, you         may want to choose the one with the better on-time         record. (Only the largest U.S. airlines are required to         maintain these codes.)            * When you make a reservation, be sure         the agent records the information accurately. Before you         hang up or leave the ticket office, review all of the         essential information with the agent-the spelling of your         name, the flight numbers and travel dates, and the cities         you are traveling between. If there is more than one         airport at either city, be sure you check which one         you'll be using. It's also important to give the airline         your home and work telephone numbers so they can let you         know if there is any change in their schedule.            * Your ticket will show the flight         number, departure time, date, and status of your         reservation for each flight of your itinerary. The         ""status"" box is important. ""OK"" means         you're confirmed. Anything else means that the         reservation is not yet certain (e.g., waitlisted).            * A ""direct"" (or         ""through"") flight can have one or more stops.         Sometimes flights with only one flight number can even         involve a change of planes. Ask about your exact routing.                    * If you are flying to a small city and         your flight number has four digits, you may be booked on         a commuter airline that has an agreement with the major         carrier in whose name the flight is held out. If you are         unsure, ask the reservations agent about the airline and         the aircraft type; these flights are identified in the         computer.            * When a reservations agent asks you to         buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a         deadline. And if you don't make the deadline, the airline         may cancel your reservations without telling you.           * Try to have your tickets in hand before         you go to the airport. This speeds your check-in and         helps you avoid some of the tension you might otherwise         feel if you had to wait in a slow-moving ticketing line         and worry about missing your flight.            * If your reservations are booked far         enough ahead of time, the airline may offer to mail your         tickets to you. However, if you don't receive the tickets         and the airline's records show that they mailed them, you         may have to go through cumbersome lost-ticket procedures         (see the end of this chapter). It is safer to check the         telephone directory for a conveniently located travel         agency or airline ticket office and buy your tickets         there.            * As soon as you receive your ticket         check to make sure all the information on it is correct,         especially the airports (if any of the cities have more         than one) and the flight dates. Have any necessary         corrections made immediately.            * Bring a photo I.D. when you fly, and         have your airline ticket issued using your name as it         appears on that I.D. Many airlines are requesting such         identification at check-in in order to reduce the re-         selling of discount tickets. (Airlines don't permit         tickets to be sold or given to other persons.) On         international flights, make sure your name is the same on         your ticket and your passport. If your name has recently         changed and the name on your ticket and your I.D. are         different, bring docu- mentation of the change (e.g., a         marriage certificate or court order).            * It's a good idea to reconfirm your         reservations before you start your trip; flight schedules         sometimes change. On international trips, most airlines         require that you reconfirm your onward or return         reservations at least 72 hours before each flight. If you         don't, your reservations may be canceled.            * Check your ticket as you board each         flight to ensure that only the correct coupon has been         removed by the airline agent.            Paying for and refunding airline         tickets           * If you plan to pay in person and with         your own bank check, take at least two forms of         identification with you like a driver's license, major         credit card, or employee I.D. card. Particularly when you         purchase tickets far from your home town, airlines,         travel agencies and other ticket outlets will want to         confirm your identity.            If you paid for your ticket with cash and         you have a refundable fare, you can often get an         immediate refund from the issuing airline or travel         agency. If you paid by personal check, the refund will         gen- erally have to be mailed to you. NOTE: In some cases         tickets purchased overseas in foreign currency can only         be refunded in that same currency and country, due to         foreign government monetary restrictions. Keep this in         mind if you are considering buying a ticket in a foreign         country.            * When you pay by credit card, your         charge account is billed-whether you use your tickets or         not. You won't receive credit unless the original unused         tickets are returned to the airline. You usually can't         get a cash refund for a credit card purchase.            * If you buy your tickets with a credit         card and then change your flights, the ticket agent may         want to credit the amount of the old tickets and issue         another set with a second charge to your account. You may         want to insist that the value of your old tickets be         applied to the new ones, with the difference in price         charged or credited to your account. While this creates a         little extra work for the airlines, it prevents         double-billing to your charge account.           Payment by credit card provides certain         protections under federal credit laws. When a refund is         due, the airline must forward a credit to your card         company within seven business days after receiving a         complete refund application. If you paid by credit card         for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a         refund that you are due, report this in writing to your         credit card company. If you write to them within 60 days         from the time that they mailed your first monthly         statement showing the charge for the airline ticket, the         card company should credit your account even if the         airline doesn't. This procedure is particularly useful if         your airline ceases operations before your flight.            Lost tickets           Airline tickets are similar to negotiable         documents. Because of this, refunds can be difficult to         obtain if tickets are lost or stolen. Many passengers         believe that air tickets can be replaced as easily as         travelers checks just because the reservation is in the         computer, but that is not the case. Your ticket number         may be shown on your credit card receipt or travel agency         itinerary. If it is not, jot down the number on a sheet         of paper and carry it separately from your ticket. Bring         it with you on your trip. If the ticket does go astray,         the airline can process your refund application more         quickly, and perhaps issue an on-the-spot replacement         ticket, if you can give them this number. You should         report a lost ticket immediately to the airline that is         shown as the issuing carrier at the top of the ticket.         You may be required to repurchase a ticket in order to         continue your trip. If you no longer meet all of the         restrictions on your discount fare (e.g., seven-day         advance purchase) the new ticket may cost more than the         old one did. In that event, however, it is generally the         higher fare that is eventually refunded, as long as you         don't change any of the cities, flights or dates on your         trip. Once the airline establishes that you actually         bought the ticket, they will begin processing your refund         application. There is often a waiting period of two to         six months. If anyone uses or cashes in your ticket while         the refund is pending, the airline may refuse to give you         your money back. Finally, there is a handling charge that         the airline may deduct from the refund. All in all,         getting a refund or replacement for a lost ticket is a         lot of trouble, and there's no guarantee you'll receive         either one. So the best advice is-don't lose the ticket         in the first place.           3. DELAYED AND CANCELED FLIGHTS           Airlines don't guarantee their schedules,         and you should realize this when planning your trip.         There are many things that can-and often do-make it         impossible for flights to arrive on time. Some of these         problems, like bad weather, air traffic delays, and         mechanical repairs, are hard to predict and beyond the         airlines' control. If your flight is delayed, try to find         out how late it will be. But keep in mind that it is         sometimes difficult for airlines to estimate the total         duration of a delay during its early stages. In so-         called ""creeping delays,"" developments occur         which were not anticipated when the carrier made its         initial estimate of the length of the delay. Weather that         had been forecast to improve can instead deteriorate, or         a mechanical problem can turn out to be more complex than         initially determined. If the problem is with local         weather or air traffic control, all flights will probably         be late and there's not much you or the airline can do to         speed up your departure. If there's a mechanical problem         with the plane for your particular flight or if the crew         is delayed on an incoming flight, you might be better off         trying to arrange another flight, as long as you don't         have to pay a cancellation penalty or higher fare for         changing your reservations. (It is sometimes easier to         make such arrangements from a pay phone than at a ticket         counter.) If you find a flight on another airline, ask         the first airline to endorse your ticket to the new         carrier; this could save you a fare increase. Remember,         however, that there is no rule requiring them to do this.         If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you         on the first flight of theirs to your destination on         which space is available, at no additional charge. If         this involves a significant delay find out if another         carrier has space, and ask the first airline to endorse         your ticket. Finding extra seats may be difficult,         however, especially over holidays and other peak travel         times.            Each airline has its own policies about         what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the         airport; there are no federal requirements. If you are         delayed, ask the airline staff if they will pay for meals         or a phone call. Some airlines, often those charging very         low fares, do not provide any amenities to stranded         passengers. Others may not offer amenities if the delay         is caused by bad weather or something else beyond the         airline's control. Contrary to popular belief, airlines         are not required to compensate passengers whose flights         are delayed or canceled. As discussed in the chapter on         overbooking, compensation is required by law only when         you are ""bumped"" from a flight that is         oversold. Airlines almost always refuse to pay passengers         for financial losses resulting from a delayed flight. If         the purpose of your trip is to close a potentially         lucrative business deal, to give a speech or lecture, to         attend a family function, or to be present at any         time-sensitive event, you might want to allow a little         extra leeway and take an earlier flight. In other words,         airline delays and cancellations aren't unusual, and         defensive counter- planning is a good idea when time is         your most important consideration. When booking your         flight remember that a departure early in the day is less         likely to be delayed than a later flight, due to         ""ripple"" effects throughout the day. Also, if         an early flight does get delayed or canceled, you have         more rerouting options. If you book the last flight of         the day and it is canceled, you could get stuck         overnight. You may select a connection (change of planes)         over a nonstop or direct flight because of the convenient         departure time or lower fare. However, a change of planes         always involves the possibility of a misconnection. If         you have a choice of connections and the fares and         service are equivalent, choose the one with the         least-congested connecting airport, so it will be easier         to get to your second flight. You may wish to take into         consideration the potential for adverse weather if you         have a choice of connecting cities. When making your         reservation for a connection, always check the amount of         time between flights. Ask yourself what will happen if         the first flight is delayed; if you don't like the         answer, pick another flight or ask the agent to         ""construct"" a connection that allows more time.                    4. OVERBOOKING           Overbooking is not illegal, and most         airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain         extent in order to compensate for ""no-shows.""         Passengers are sometimes left behind or         ""bumped"" as a result. When an oversale occurs,         the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires airlines         to ask people who aren't in a hurry to give up their         seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation. Those         passengers bumped against their will are, with a few         exceptions, entitled to compensation.            Voluntary bumping           Almost any group of airline passengers         includes some people with urgent travel needs and others         who may be more concerned about the cost of their tickets         than about getting to their destination on time. Our         rules require airlines to seek out people who are willing         to give up their seats for some compensation before         bumping anyone in- voluntarily. Here's how this works. At         the check-in or boarding area, airline employees will         look for volunteers when it appears that the flight has         been oversold. If you're not in a rush to arrive at your         next destination, you can give your reservation back to         the airline in exchange for compensation and a later         flight. But before you do this, you may want to get         answers to these important questions:           * When is the next flight on which the         airline can confirm your seat? The alternate flight may         be just as acceptable to you. On the other hand, if they         offer to put you on standby on another flight that's         full, you could be stranded.            * Will the airline provide other         amenities such as free meals, a hotel room, phone calls,         or ground transportation? If not, you might have to spend         the money they offer you on food or lodging while you         wait for the next flight.           DOT has not said how much the airline has         to give volunteers. This means carriers may negotiate         with their passengers for a mutually acceptable amount of         money-or maybe a free trip or other benefits. Airlines         give employees guidelines for bargaining with passengers,         and they may select those volunteers willing to sell back         their reservations for the lowest price. If the airline         offers you a free ticket, ask about restrictions. How         long is the ticket good for? Is it ""blacked         out"" during holiday periods when you might want to         use it? Can it be used for international flights? Most         importantly, can you make a reservation, and if so, how         far before departure are you permitted to make it?            Involuntary bumping           DOT requires each airline to give all         passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written         statement describing their rights and explaining how the         carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who         doesn't. Those travelers who don't get to fly are         frequently entitled to an on-the-spot payment of denied         boarding compensation. The amount depends on the price of         their ticket and the length of the delay:           * If you are bumped involuntarily and the         airline arranges substitute transportation that is         scheduled to get you to your final destination (including         later connections) within one hour of your original         scheduled arrival time, there is no compensation.            If the airline arranges substitute         transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your         destination between one and two hours after your original         arrival time (between one and four hours on international         flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to         your one-way fare to your final destination, with a $200         maximum.            * If the substitute transportation is         scheduled to get you to your destination more than two         hours later (four hours internationally), or if the         airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements         for you, the compensation doubles (200% of your fare,         $400 maximum).            * You always get to keep your original         ticket and use it on another flight. If you choose to         make your own arrangements, you can request an         ""involuntary refund"" for the ticket for the         flight you were bumped from. The denied boarding         compensation is essentially a payment for your         inconvenience.            Like all rules, however, there are a few         conditions and exceptions:           * To be eligible for compensation, you         must have a confirmed reservation. An ""OK"" in         the Status box of your ticket qualifies you in this         regard even if the airline can't find your reservation in         the computer, as long as you didn't cancel your         reservation or miss a reconfirmation deadline.           * You must meet the airline's deadline         for buying your ticket. Discount tickets must usually be         purchased within a certain number of days after the         reservation was made. Other tickets normally have to be         picked up no later than 30 minutes before the flight.            In addition to the ticketing deadline,         each airline has a check-in deadline, which is the amount         of time before scheduled departure that you must present         yourself to the airline at the airport. For domestic         flights most carriers have a deadline of 10 minutes         before scheduled departure, but some can be an hour or         longer. (Many airlines require pas- sengers with advance         seat assignments to check in 30 minutes before scheduled         departure, even if they already have advance boarding         passes. If you miss this deadline you may lose the         specific seats you were promised, although not the         reservation itself.) Check-in deadlines on international         flights can be as much as three hours before scheduled         departure time, due partially to security procedures.         Some airlines may simply require you to be at the         ticket/baggage counter by this time; most, however,         require that you get all the way to the boarding area. If         you miss the ticketing or check-in deadline, you may have         lost your reservation and your right to compensation if         the flight is oversold.           * As noted above, no compensation is due         if the airline arranges substitute transportation which         is scheduled to arrive at your destination within one         hour of your originally scheduled arrival time.           * If the airline must substitute a         smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use,         the carrier isn't required to pay people who are bumped         as a result.           * The rules do not apply to charter         flights, or to scheduled flights operated with planes         that hold 60 or fewer passengers. They don't apply to         international flights inbound to the United States,         although some airlines on these routes may follow them         voluntarily. Also, if you are flying between two foreign         cities-from Paris to Rome, for example-these rules will         not apply. The European Community has a rule on bumpings         that occur in an EC country; ask the airline for details,         or contact DOT.            The most effective way to reduce the risk         of being bumped is to get to the airport early. On         oversold flights the last passengers to check in are         usually the first to be bumped, even if they have met the         check-in deadline. Allow extra time; assume that the         airport access road is backed up, the parking lot is         full, and there is a long line at the check-in counter.         However, if you arrive so early that your airline has         another flight to your destination leaving before the one         that you are booked on, either switch to the earlier         flight or don't check your bag until after the first         flight leaves. If you check your bag right away, it might         get put on the earlier flight and remain unattended at         your destination airport for hours. Airlines may offer         free transportation on future flights in place of a check         for denied boarding compensation. However, if you are         bumped involuntarily you have the right to insist on a         check if that is your preference. Once you cash the check         (or accept the free flight), you will probably lose the         right to demand more money from the airline later on.         However, if being bumped costs you more money than the         airline will pay you at the airport, you can try to         negotiate a higher settlement with their complaint         department. If this doesn't work, you usually have 30         days from the date on the check to decide if you want to         accept the amount of the check. You are always free to         decline the check and take the airline to court to try to         obtain more compensation. The government's denied         boarding regulation spells out the airlines' minimum         obligation to people they bump involuntarily. Finally,         don't be a ""no-show."" If you are holding         confirmed reservations you don't plan to use, notify the         airline. If you don't, they will cancel all onward or         return reservations on your trip.            5. BAGGAGE           Between the time you check your luggage         in and the time you claim it at your destination, it may         have passed through a maze of conveyor belts and baggage         carts; once airborne, baggage may tumble around the cargo         compartment if the plane hits rough air. In all fairness         to the airlines, however, relatively few bags are damaged         or lost. With some common-sense packing and other         precautions, your bags will probably be among the ones         that arrive safely.            Packing           You can pack to avoid problems. Some         items should never be put into a bag you plan to check         into the cargo compartment:           * Small valuables: cash, credit cards,         jewelry, cameras.            * Critical items: medicine, keys,         passport, tour vouchers, business papers.           * Irreplaceable items: manuscript,         heirlooms.           * Fragile items: eyeglasses, glass         containers, liquids.            Things like this should be carried on         your person or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit         under the seat. Remember, the only way to be sure your         valuables are not damaged or lost is to keep them with         you. Even if your bag is not lost, it could be delayed         for a day or two. Don't put perishables in a checked bag;         they may spoil if it is delayed. It is wise to put items         that you will need during the first 24 hours in a         carry-on bag (e.g. toiletries, a change of underwear).         Check with the airline for its limits on the size,         weight, or number of carry-on pieces. (There is no single         federal standard.) If you are using more than one         airline, check on all of them. Inquire about your flight;         different airplanes can have different limits. Don't         assume that the flight will have unlimited closet space         for carry-on garment bags; some may have to be checked.         If you plan to go shopping at your destination and bring         your purchases aboard as carry-on, keep the limits in         mind. If you check these purchases, however, carry the         receipts separately; they may be necessary for a claim if         the merchandise is lost or damaged. Don't put anything         into a carry-on bag that could be considered a weapon         (e.g. scissors, pen knife).            Checked baggage is also subject to         limits. On most domestic and international flights, it's         two checked bags (three if you don't have any carry-on         luggage). There can be an extra charge if you bring more,         or if you exceed the airline's limits on the size of the         bags. On some flights between two foreign cities, your         allowance may be based on the weight of the bags rather         than the number of pieces. The same two bags that cost         you nothing to check when you started your trip could         result in expensive excess-baggage charges under a weight         system. Ask the airlines about the limit for every         segment of your international trip before you leave home,         especially if you have a stopover of a day or two or if         you are changing carriers. The bags you check should be         labeled- inside and out-with your name, address and phone         number. Add the name and address of a person to contact         at your destination if it's practical to do so. Almost         all of the bags that are misplaced by airlines do turn up         sooner or later. With proper labeling, the bag and its         owner can usually be reunited within a few hours. Don't         overpack a bag. This puts pressure on the latches, making         it easier for them to pop open. Also, lock your bags. The         locks aren't very effective against pilferage, but they         help to keep the latches from springing. If you plan to         check any electrical equipment, glassware, small         appliances, pottery, typewriters, musical instruments or         other fragile items, they should be packed in a container         specifically designed to survive rough handling*         preferably a factory-sealed carton or a padded hard-         shell carrying case.            Check-in           Don't check in at the last minute. Even         if you make the flight, your bag may not. If you miss the         airline's check-in deadline, the carrier might not assume         liability for your bag if it is delayed or lost. If you         have a choice, select flights that minimize the potential         for baggage disruption. The likelihood of a bag going         astray increases from #1 to #4 below (i.e., #1 is         safest): 1) nonstop flight 2) direct or 'through' flight         (one or more stops, but no change of aircraft) 3) online         connection (change of aircraft but not airlines) 4)         interline connection (change of aircraft and airlines)         When you check in, remove straps and hooks from garment         bags that you are sending as checked baggage. These can         get caught in baggage processing machinery, causing         damage to the bag. The airline will put baggage         destination tags on your luggage and give you the stubs         to use as claim checks. Make sure you get a stub for         every bag. Don't throw them away until after you get your         bags back and you check the contents. Not only will you         need them if a claim is necessary, but you may need to         show them to security upon leaving the baggage-claim         area. Each tag has a three-letter code and flight number         that show the baggage sorters on which plane and to which         airport your luggage is supposed to go. Double-check the         tag before your bags go down the conveyor belt. (The         airline will be glad to tell you the code for your         destination when you make reservations or buy your         tickets.) Your bags may only be checked to one of your         intermediate stops rather than your destination city if         you must clear Customs short of your final destination,         or if you are taking a connection involving two airlines         that don't have an interline agreement. Be sure all of         the tags from previous trips are removed from your bag,         since they may confuse busy baggage handlers.            Claiming your bags           Many bags look alike. After you pull what         you think is your bag off the carousel, check the name         tag or the bag tag number. If your bag arrives open,         unlocked or visibly damaged, check right away to see if         any of the contents are missing or damaged. Report any         problems to the airline before leaving the airport;         insist on filling out a form. Open your suitcase         immediately when you get to where you are staying. Any         damage to the contents or any pilferage should be         immediately reported to the airline by telephone. Make a         note of the date and time of the call, and the name and         telephone number of the person you spoke with. Follow up         immediately with a certified letter to the airline.            Damage           If your suitcase arrives smashed or torn,         the airline will usually pay for repairs. If it can't be         fixed, they will negotiate a settlement to pay you its         depreciated value. The same holds true for belongings         packed inside. Airlines may decline to pay for damage         caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or         inadequate packing, rather than the airline's rough         handling. Carriers may also refuse to give you money for         your damaged items inside the bag when there's no         evidence of external damage to the suitcase. But airlines         generally don't disclaim liability for fragile         merchandise packed in its original factory sealed carton,         a cardboard mailing tube, or other container designed for         shipping and packed with protective padding material.         When you check in, airline personnel should let you know         if they think your suitcase or package may not survive         the trip intact. Before accepting a questionable item,         they will ask you to sign a statement in which you agree         to check it at your own risk. But even if you do sign         this form, the airline might be liable for damage if it         is caused by its own negligence shown by external injury         to the suitcase or package.            Delayed bags           If you and your suitcase don't connect at         your destination, don't panic. The airlines have very         sophisticated systems that track down about 98% of the         bags they misplace and return them to their owners within         hours. In many cases they will absorb reasonable expenses         you incur while they look for your missing belongings.         You and the airline may have different ideas of what's         reasonable, however, and the amount they will pay is         subject to negotiation.            If your bags don't come off the conveyor         belt, report this to the airline before you leave the         airport. Insist that they fill out a form and give you a         copy, even if they say the bag will be in on the next         flight. If the form doesn't contain the name of the         person who filled it out, ask for it. Get an appropriate         phone number for following up (not the Reservations         number). Don't assume that the airline will deliver the         bag without charge when it is found; ask them about this.         Most carriers set guidelines for their airport employees         that allow them to disburse some money at the airport for         emergency purchases. The amount depends on whether or not         you're away from home and how long it takes to track down         your bags and return them to you. If the airline does not         provide you a cash advance, it may still reimburse you         later for the purchase of necessities. Discuss with the         carrier the types of articles that would be reimbursable,         and keep all receipts. If the airline misplaces sporting         equip- ment, it will sometimes pay for the rental of         replacements. For replacement clothing or other articles,         the carrier might offer to absorb only a portion of the         purchase cost, on the basis that you will be able to use         the new items in the future. (The airline may agree to a         higher reimbursement if you turn the articles over to         them.) When you've checked in fresh foods or any other         perishable goods and they are ruined because their         delivery is delayed, the airline won't reimburse you.         Carriers may be liable if they lose or damage perishable         items, but they won't accept responsibility for spoilage         caused by a delay in delivery. Airlines are liable for         provable consequential damages up to the amount of their         liability limit (see below) in connection with the delay.         If you can't resolve the claim with the airline's airport         staff, keep a record of the names of the employees with         whom you dealt, and hold on to all travel documents and         receipts for any money you spent in connection with the         mishandling. (It's okay to surrender your baggage claim         tags to the airline when you fill out a form at the         airport, as long as you get a copy of the form and it         notes that you gave up the tags.) Call or write the         airline's consumer office when you get home.            Lost luggage           Once your bag is declared officially         lost, you will have to submit a claim. This usually means         you have to fill out a second, more detailed form. Check         on this; failure to complete the second form when         required could delay your claim. Missing the deadline for         filing it could invalidate your claim altogether. The         airline will usually refer your claim form to a central         office, and the negotiations between you and the airline         will begin. If your flight was a connection involving two         carriers, the final carrier is normally the one         responsible for processing your claim even if it appears         that the first airline lost the bag. Airlines don't         automatically pay the full amount of every claim they         receive. First, they will use the information on your         form to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Like         insurance companies, airlines consider the depreciated         value of your possessions, not their original price or         the replacement costs. If you're tempted to exaggerate         your claim, don't. Airlines may completely deny claims         they feel are inflated or fraudulent. They often ask for         sales receipts and other documentation to back up claims,         especially if a large amount of money is involved. If you         don't keep extensive records, you can expect to dicker         with the airline over the value of your goods. Generally,         it takes an airline anywhere from six weeks to three         months to pay you for your lost luggage. When they tender         a settlement, they may offer you the option of free         tickets on future flights in a higher amount than the         cash payment. Ask about all restrictions on these         tickets, such as ""blackout"" periods and how far         before departure you are permitted to make a reservation.                    Limits on liability           If your bags are delayed, lost or damaged         on a domestic trip, the airline can invoke a ceiling of         $2,500 per passenger on the amount of money they'll pay         you. (This limit is $1,250 for flights before January 18,         2000.) When your luggage and its contents are worth more         than the liability limit, you may want to purchase         ""excess valuation,"" if available, from the         airline as you check in. This is not insurance, but it         will increase the carrier's potential liability. The         airline may refuse to sell excess valuation on some items         that are especially valuable or breakable, such as         antiques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts,         negotiable securities and cash.            On international trips, the liability         limit is set by a treaty called the Warsaw Convention.         Unless you buy excess valuation, the liability limit is         $9.07 per pound ($20 per kilo). In order to limit its         liability to this amount, the airline must use one of the         following procedures:           1) The carrier weighs your bags at         check-in and records this weight on your ticket. The         airline's maximum liability to you is that weight         multiplied by $9.07 (or by $20, if the weight was         recorded in kilos).           2) Instead of weighing your luggage, the         carrier assumes that each of your bags weighs the maximum         that it agrees to accept as checked baggage, usually 70         pounds (32 kilos). This yields a liability limit of about         $640 per bag.            This international limit also applies to         domestic segments of an international journey. This is         the case even if the domestic and international flights         are on separate tickets and you claim and re-check your         bag between the two flights. Keep in mind that the         liability limits are maximums. If the depreciated value         of your property is worth less than the liability limit,         this lower amount is what you will be offered. If the         airline's settlement doesn't fully reimburse your loss,         check your homeowner's or renter's insurance; it         sometimes covers losses away from the residence. Some         credit card companies and travel agencies offer optional         or even automatic supplemental baggage coverage.            Hazardous Items           Except for toiletries and medicines         totaling no more than 75 ounces, it is illegal and         extremely dangerous to carry on board or check in your         luggage any of the following hazardous materials:           * Aerosols: Polishes, waxes, degreasers,         cleaners, etc. * Corrosives: Acids, cleaners, wet cell         batteries, etc. * Flammables: Paints, thinners, lighter         fluid, liquid reservoir lighters, cleaners, adhesives,         camp stoves or portable gas equipment with fuel, etc. *         Explosives: Fireworks, flares, signal devices, loaded         firearms, gunpowder, etc. (Small arms ammunition for         personal use may be transported in checked luggage if it         is securely packed in material designed for that purpose.         These may not be placed in carry-on baggage.) *         Radioactives: Betascopes, radiopharmaceuticals,         uninstalled pacemakers, etc. * Compressed gases: Tear gas         or protective- type sprays, oxygen cylinders, divers'         tanks (unless they're empty), etc. * Infectious         substances * Poisonous materials: Rat poison, etc.           Matches (both 'strike anywhere' matches         and safety or 'book' matches) may only be carried on your         person. If you must travel with any of these materials,         check with the airline's air freight department to see if         special arrangements can be made. A violation of the         hazardous materials restrictions can result in a civil         penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation or a criminal         penalty of up to $500,000 and/or up to 5 years in jail.           6. SMOKING           Under U.S. government rules, smoking is         prohibited on all domestic scheduled-service flights         except for flights over six hours to or from Alaska or         Hawaii. This ban applies to domestic segments of         international flights, on both U.S. and foreign airlines         (e.g., the Chicago / New York leg of a flight that         operates Chicago/ New York / London). The ban does not         apply to nonstop international flights, even during the         time that they are in U.S. airspace (e.g., a Chicago /         London flight). The prohibition applies in the passenger         cabin and lavatories, but not in the cockpit. Smoking is         also banned on other scheduled-service flights by U.S.         airlines that are operated with planes seating fewer than         30 passengers (e.g., certain ""commuter"" flights         to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean). Cigar and pipe         smoking is banned on all U.S.-carrier flights (scheduled         and charter, domestic and international). The following         rules apply to U.S. airlines on flights where smoking is         not banned (e.g. international flights, domestic charter         flights). These regulations do not apply to foreign         airlines; however, most of them provide non-smoking         sections (although they may not guarantee seating there         or expand the section).           * The airline must provide a seat in a         non-smoking section to every passenger who asks for one,         as long as the passenger complies with the carrier's seat         assignment deadline and procedures. (Standby passengers         do not have this right.)            * If necessary, the airline must expand         the non- smoking section to accommodate the passengers         described above.            * The airline does not have to provide a         non-smoking seat of the passenger's choice. It doesn't         have to seat you with your traveling companion, and you         don't have the right to specify a window or aisle         non-smoking seat. Also, the airline is not required by         this rule to provide advance seat assignments before the         flight date in the non-smoking section, as long as they         get you into the non-smoking section on the day of your         flight.            * The flight crew must act to keep         passengers from smoking in the non-smoking sections.         However, smoke that drifts from the smoking section into         the non-smoking section does not constitute a violation.            * No smoking is allowed while an aircraft         is on the ground or when the ventilation system is not         fully functioning.            * Carriers are not required to have a         smoking section. An airline is free to ban smoking on a         particular flight, or on all of its flights.            None of the regulations described in this         chapter apply to charter flights performed with small         aircraft by on-demand air taxi operators.            7. PASSENGERS WITH DISABILITIES           Over 40 million Americans have         disabilities. The Air Carrier Access Act and the DOT rule         that implements it set out procedures designed to ensure         that these individuals have the same opportunity as         anyone else to enjoy a pleasant flight. Here are some of         the major provisions of the rule.            * A person may not be refused         transportation on the basis of disability or be required         to have an attendant or produce a medical certificate,         except in certain limited circumstances specified in the         rule.            * Airlines must provide enplaning,         deplaning and connecting assistance, including both         personnel and equipment. (Some small commuter aircraft         may not be accessible to passengers with severe mobility         impairments. When making plans to fly to small cities,         such passengers should check on the aircraft type and its         accessibility.)            * Airport terminals and airline         reservations centers must have TDD telephone devices for         persons with hearing or speech impairments.            * Passengers with vision or hearing         impairments must have timely access to the same         information given to other passengers at the airport or         on the plane concerning gate assignments, delayed         flights, safety, etc.            * New widebody aircraft must have a         wheelchair- accessible lavatory and an on-board         wheelchair. Airlines must put an on-board wheelchair on         most other flights upon a passenger's request (48 hours         notice required).            * Air carriers must accept wheelchairs as         checked baggage, and cannot require passengers to sign         liability waivers for them (except for pre-existing         damage).            * Most new airplanes must have movable         armrests on half the aisle seats, and on-board stowage         for one folding passenger wheelchair.            * Carriers must allow service animals to         accompany passengers in the cabin, as long as they don't         block the aisle or other emergency evacuation route.            * FAA safety rules establish standards         for passengers allowed to sit in emergency exit rows;         such persons must be able to perform certain         evacuation-related functions.            * FAA rules also prohibit passengers from         bringing their own oxygen. Most airlines will provide         aircraft-approved oxygen for a fee, but aren't required         to.            * Airlines may not charge for services         that are required by this rule.            * Airlines must make available a         specially-trained Complaints Resolution Official if a         dispute arises. There must be a copy of the DOT rule at         every airport.            It's wise to call the airline again         before your trip to reconfirm any assistance that you         have requested. For additional details, see ""Other         Sources of Information"" at the end of this pamphlet         for information on ordering the booklet New Horizons for         the Air Traveler with a Disability.            8. FREQUENT-FLYER PROGRAMS           Virtually all major U.S. airlines have a         frequent-flyer plan, and many foreign carriers are         starting them. These programs allow you to earn free         trips, upgrades (e.g., from Coach to First Class) or         other awards based on how often you fly on that airline.         In some programs you can earn credit by using specified         hotels, rental car companies, credit cards, etc. It         doesn't cost anything to join a program, and you can         enroll in the programs of any number of different         airlines. However, it may not be to your advantage to         ""put all your eggs in one basket"" with one plan         by accumulating a high mileage balance only to find out         later that another carrier's program suits your needs         better. Here are some things to look at when selecting a         frequent-flyer program.            * Does the airline fly where you're         likely to want to go?            * Are there tie-ins with other carriers,         especially those with international routes? Is some of         the airline's service provided by commuter-carrier         ""partners""? In both cases, can you earn credits         and use awards on those other airlines?            * How many miles (or trips) are required         for particular awards?            * Is there a minimum award per flight         (e.g., you are only flying 200 miles but the airline         always awards at least 500)?            * Is there a deadline for using         accumulated miles?            * Carefully examine the number and length         of any ""blackout periods"" during which awards         cannot be used. On some carriers, the Thanksgiving         blackout may last a week.            * If you are planning a big trip and are         thinking about joining that airline's frequent-flyer         program, enroll before you travel. Airlines usually won't         credit mileage that was flown before you became a member.                    After you join a program, there are other         things that you should know:           * Airlines reserve the right to make         changes to their programs, sometimes on short notice. The         number of miles required for particular awards might be         raised, requiring you to use your old mileage (i.e., your         current balance) under the more restrictive new rules.         The airline may cease service on a route that you were         particularly interested in-or it may drop the city you         live in! The carrier may eliminate attractive         frequent-flyer tie-ins with particular airlines or hotel         chains.            * Cashing in your mileage frequently will         limit your losses in case the carrier changes the rules,         merges, or goes out of business. (Some private companies         sell insurance covering some of these eventualities.)         Accumulating a larger mileage balance will entitle you to         bigger awards, however.            * Carriers often limit the number of         seats on each flight for which frequent-flyer awards can         be used. You may not be able to get reservations on your         first- or second-choice dates or flights.            * Awards can often be issued in the name         of immediate family members. However, if you sell or give         an award to someone not named on the award or the travel         document and the airline finds out, the recipient could         have his or her ticket confiscated, and the carrier may         penalize the program member's account balance.            * Ask the airline how mileage is         registered; you will probably have to identify yourself         as a program member when you book your flight or when you         check in.            * Keep your boarding passes and the         passenger coupon of your ticket until you receive a         statement from the frequent-flyer program reflecting the         correct mileage earnings for that trip. If a problem         arises, get the names of the people you speak with and         keep notes of your conversations.            9. CONTRACT TERMS           Throughout this booklet, we have tried to         provide you general information about airline travel. It         is important to realize, however, that each airline has         specific rules that make up your contract of carriage.         These rules may differ among carriers. They include         provisions such as check-in deadlines, refund procedures,         responsibility for delayed flights, and many other         things.            Domestic Travel           For domestic travel, an airline may         provide all of its contract terms on or with your ticket         at the time you buy it. Many small ""commuter""         carriers use this system. Other airlines may elect to         ""incorporate terms by reference."" This means         that you are not given all the airline's rules with your         ticket-most of them are contained in a separate document         which you can inspect on request. If an airline elects to         ""incorporate by reference"" it must provide         conspicuous written notice with each ticket that: 1) it         incorporates terms by reference, and 2) these terms may         include liability limitations, claim-filing deadlines,         check-in deadlines, and certain other key terms. The         airline must also:           * Ensure that passengers can receive an         explanation of key terms identified on the ticket from         any location where the carrier's tickets are sold,         including travel agencies;            * Make available for inspection the full         text of its contract of carriage at each of its own         airport and city ticket offices;            * Mail a free copy of the full text of         its contract of carriage upon request.           There are additional notice requirements         for contract terms that affect your air fare. Airlines         must provide a conspicuous written notice on or with the         ticket concerning any ""incorporated"" contract         terms that:           * Restrict refunds;           * Impose monetary penalties; or           * Permit the airline to raise the price         after you've bought the ticket.           If an airline incorporates contract terms         by reference and fails to provide the required notice         about a particular rule, the passenger will not be bound         by that rule.           International Travel           Not all of the detailed requirements for         disclosing domestic contract terms apply to international         travel. Airlines file ""tariff rules"" with the         government for this transportation. Passengers are         generally bound by these rules whether or not they         receive actual notice about them. Every international         airline must keep a copy of its tariff rules at its         airport and city ticket offices. You have a right to         examine these rules. The airline agents must answer your         questions about information in the tariff, and they must         help you locate specific tariff rules, if necessary. If         the airline keeps its tariff in a computer rather than on         paper, there are additional disclosure requirements which         are similar to those for domestic contract terms. The         most important point to remember, whether your travel is         domestic or international, is that you should not be         afraid to ask questions about a carrier's rules. You have         a right to know the terms of your contract of carriage.         It is in your best interest, as well as that of the         airline, for you to ask in advance about any matters of         uncertainty.            10 TRAVEL SCAMS           Unlike most products, travel services         usually have to be paid for before they are delivered.         This creates opportunities for disreputable individuals         and companies. Some travel packages turn out to be very         different from what was presented or what the consumer         expected. Some don't materialize at all! If you receive         an offer by phone or mail for a free or extremely         low-priced vacation trip to a popular destination (often         Hawaii or Florida), there are a few things you should         look for:           * Does the price seem too good to be         true? If so, it probably is.            * Are you asked to give your credit card         number over the phone?            * Are you pressured to make an immediate         decision?            * Is the carrier simply identified as         ""a major airline,"" or does the representative         offer a collection of airlines without being able to say         which one you will be on?            * Is the representative unable or         unwilling to give you a street address for the company?            * Are you told you can't leave for at         least two months? (The deadline for disputing a credit         card charge is 60 days, and most scam artists know this.)                    If you encounter any of these symptoms,         proceed cautiously. Ask for written information to be         sent to you; any legitimate travel company will be happy         to oblige. If they don't have a brochure, ask for a day         or two to think it over; most bona fide deals that are         good today will still be good two days from now. If they         say no to both requests, this probably isn't the trip for         you. Some other advice:           * If you are told that you've won a free         vacation, ask if you have to buy something else in order         to get it. Some packages have promoted free air fare, as         long as you buy expensive hotel arrangements. Others         include a free hotel stay, but no air fare.            * If you are seriously considering the         vacation offer and are confident you have established the         full price you will pay, compare the offer to what you         might obtain elsewhere. Frequently, the appeal of free         air fare or free accommodations disguises the fact that         the total price is still higher than that of a regular         package tour.            * Get a confirmed departure date, in         writing, before you pay anything. Eye skeptically any         promises that an acceptable date will be arranged later.         If the package involves standby or waitlist travel, or a         reservation that can only be provided much later, ask if         your payment is refundable if you want to cancel, and         don't pay any money you can't afford to lose.            * If the destination is a beach resort,         ask the seller how far the hotel is from the beach. Then         ask the hotel.            * Determine the complete cost of the trip         in dollars, including all service charges, taxes,         processing fees, etc.            * If you decide to buy the trip after         checking it out, paying by credit card gives you certain         legal rights to pursue a chargeback (credit) if promised         services aren't delivered.

However, there are certain things         you can do to ensure that your flight is as comfortable         as possible. Changes in pressure can temporarily block         the Eustachian tube, causing your ears to 'pop' or to         experience a sensation of fullness. To equalize the         pressure, swallow frequently; chewing gum sometimes         helps. Yawning is also effective. Avoid sleeping during         descent; you may not swallow often enough to keep ahead         of the pressure change. If yawning or swallowing doesn't         help, use the 'valsalva maneuver':            * Pinch your nostrils shut, then breathe         in a mouthful of air.            * Using only your cheek and throat         muscles, force air into the back of your nose as if you         were trying to blow your thumb and finger off your         nostrils.            * Be very gentle and blow in short         successive attempts. When you hear or feel a pop in your         ears, you have succeeded. Never force air from your lungs         or abdomen (diaphragm); this can create pressures that         are too intense.            Babies are especially troubled by these         pressure changes during descent. Having them feed from a         bottle or suck on a pacifier will often provide relief.         Avoid flying if you have recently had abdominal, eye or         oral surgery, including a root canal. The pressure         changes that occur during climb and descent can result in         discomfort. If you have an upper respiratory or sinus         infection, you may also experience discomfort resulting         from pressure changes. Postpone your trip if possible.         (Check to see if your fare has cancellation or change         penalties.) A final tip on pressure changes: they cause         your feet to swell. Try not to wear new or tight shoes         while flying.            Alcohol and coffee both have a drying         effect on the body. Airliner cabin air is relatively dry         to begin with, and the combination can increase your         chances of contracting a respiratory infection. If you         wear contact lenses, the low cabin humidity and/or         consumption of alcohol or coffee can reduce your tear         volume, leading to discomfort if you don't blink often         enough. Lens wearers should clean their lenses thoroughly         before the flight, use lubricating eye drops during the         flight, read in intervals, and take the lenses out if         they nap. (This may not apply to extended wear lenses;         consult your practitioner.) If you take prescription         medications, bring enough to last through your trip. Take         along a copy of the prescription, or your doctor's name         and telephone number, in case the medication is lost or         stolen. The medicine should be in the original         prescription bottle in order to avoid questions at         security or Customs inspections. Carry it in a pocket or         a carry-on bag; don't pack it in a checked bag, in case         the bag is lost.            You can minimize the effects of jet lag         in several ways:           * Get several good nights' sleep before         your trip.           * Try to take a flight that arrives at         night, so you can go straight to bed.           * Sleep on the plane (although not during         descent).           * During the flight do isometric         exercises, eat lightly, and drink little or no alcohol.            Try to use a rest room in the airport         terminal before departure. On some flights the cabin crew         begins beverage service shortly after the ""Fasten         Seat Belts"" sign is turned off, and the serving cart         may block access to the lavatories.            12 AIRLINE SAFETY           Air travel is so safe you'll probably         never have to use any of the advice we're about to give         you. But if you ever do need it, this information could         save your life. Airline passengers usually take safety         for granted when they board an airplane. They tune out         the crew's pre-flight announcements or reach for a         magazine instead of the cards that show how to open the         emergency exit and what to do if the oxygen mask drops         down. Because of this, people are needlessly hurt or         killed in accidents they could have survived. Every time         you board a plane, here are some things you should do:           * Be reasonable about the amount of         carry-on luggage that you bring. FAA rules require         airlines to limit the amount of carry-on baggage, and if         you try to carry too much with you, the crew may insist         that you check in some items. (There is no universal         limit; it depends on the aircraft type and the passenger         load.) A bag that is not properly stowed could turn into         an unguided missile in an accident or block the aisles         during an evacuation.            * Be careful about what you put into the         storage bins over your seat. Their doors may pop open         during an accident or even a hard landing, spilling their         contents. Also, passengers in aisle seats have been         injured by heavy items falling out of these compartments         when people are stowing or retrieving belongings at the         beginning or end of a flight. Please be considerate of         others and put hard, heavy items under the seat in front         of you; save the overhead bins for coats, hats, and         small, soft bags.           * As soon as you sit down, fasten and         unfasten your seat belt a couple of times. Watch how it         works. There are several kinds of belts, and in an         emergency you don't want to waste time fumbling with the         buckle.            * Before take-off, there will be a         briefing about safety procedures, pointing out emergency         exits and explaining seat belts, life vests and oxygen         masks. Listen carefully and if there's anything you don't         understand ask the flight attendants for help.            The plastic card in the seat pocket in         front of you will review some of the safety information         announced by the flight attendant. Read it. It also tells         you about emergency exits and how to find and use         emergency equipment such as oxygen masks. As you're         reading the card look for your closest emergency exit,         and count the number of rows between yourself and this         exit. Remember, the closest exit may be behind you. Have         a second escape route planned in case the nearest exit is         blocked. This is important because people sometimes head         for the door they used to board the plane, usually in the         front of the first class cabin. This wastes time and         blocks the aisles. Oxygen masks aren't the same on all         planes. Sometimes they drop down in front of you. On some         aircraft, however, you'll have to pull them out of a         compartment in front of your seat. In either case, you         must tug the plastic tube slightly to get the oxygen         flowing. If you don't understand the instructions about         how the mask works, ask a flight attendant to explain it         to you. When the plane is safely in the air and has         reached its cruising level, the pilot usually turns off         the ""fasten seat belt"" sign. He or she usually         suggests that passengers keep their belts buckled anyway         during the flight in case the plane hits rough air. Just         as seat belts should always be worn in cars, they should         always be fastened in airplanes.            If you are ever in an air accident, you         should remember these things:           * Stay calm.            * Listen to the crew members and do what         they say. The cabin crew's most important job is to help         you leave safely.            * Before you try to open any emergency         exit yourself, look outside the window. If you see a fire         outside the door, don't open it or the flames may spread         into the cabin. Try to use your alternate escape route.            * Remember, smoke rises. So try to stay         down if there's smoke in the cabin. Follow the track of         emergency lights embedded in the floor; they lead to an         exit. If you have a cloth, put it over your nose and         mouth.            After an air accident, the National         Transportation Safety Board always talks to survivors to         try to learn why they were able to make it through         safely. They've discovered that, as a rule, it does help         to be prepared. Avoiding serious injury or surviving an         air accident isn't just a matter of luck; it's also a         matter of being informed and thinking ahead. Are you one         of those people who jumps up as soon as the plane lands,         gathers up coat, suitcase and briefcase, and gets ready         to sprint while the plane is still moving? If so, resist         the urge. Planes sometimes make sudden stops when they         are taxiing to the airport gate, and passengers have been         injured when they were thrown onto a seat back or the         edge of a door to an overhead bin. Stay in your seat with         your belt buckled until the plane comes to a complete         halt and the 'fasten seat belt' sign is turned off. Never         smoke in airplane restrooms. Smoking was banned in all         but the designated smoking sections after an accident         killed 116 people in only 4 minutes, apparently because a         careless smoker left a burning cigarette butt in the         trash bin. There is a penalty of up to $2,000 for         disabling a lavatory smoke detector. Also, don't smoke in         the aisle. If there is a sudden bump you could stumble         and burn yourself or another passenger. Lit cigarettes         have also flown out of passengers' hands and rolled under         seats.            13. COMPLAINING           When passengers comment on airline         service, most airlines do listen. They analyze and keep         track of the complaints and compliments they receive and         use the information to determine what the public wants         and to identify problem areas that need special         attention. They also try to resolve individual         complaints. Like other businesses, airlines have a lot of         discretion in how they respond to problems. While you do         have some rights as a passenger, your demands for         compensation will probably be subject to negotiation and         the kind of action you get depends in large part on the         way you go about complaining. Start with the airline.         Before you call or write to DOT or some other agency for         help with an air travel problem, you should give the         airline a chance to resolve it. As a rule, airlines have         trouble-shooters at the airports (they're usually called         Customer Service Representatives) who can take care of         many problems on the spot. They can arrange meals and         hotel rooms for stranded passengers, write checks for         denied boarding compensation, arrange luggage repairs and         settle other routine claims or complaints            If you can't resolve the problem at the         airport and want to file a complaint, it's best to call         or write the airline's consumer office at its corporate         headquarters. Take notes at the time the incident occurs         and jot down the names of the carrier employees with whom         you dealt. Keep all of your travel documents (ticket         receipts, baggage check stubs, boarding passes, etc.) as         well as receipts for any out-of-pocket expenses that were         incurred as a result of the mishandling. Here are some         helpful tips should you choose to write a letter.           * Type the letter and, if at all         possible, limit it to one page in length.            * Include your daytime telephone number         (with area code).            * No matter how angry you might be, keep         your letter businesslike in tone and don't exaggerate         what happened. If the complaint sounds very vehement or         sarcastic, you might wait a day and then consider         rewriting it.            * Describe what happened, and give dates,         cities, and flight numbers or flight times.            * Send copies, never the originals, of         tickets and receipts or other documents that can back up         your claim.            * Include the names of any employees who         were rude or made things worse, as well as anyone who         might have been especially helpful.            * Don't clutter up your complaint with         petty gripes that can obscure what you're really angry         about.            * Let the airline know if you've suffered         any special inconvenience or monetary losses.            * Say just what you expect the carrier to         do to make amends. An airline may offer to settle your         claim with a check or some other kind of compensation,         possibly free transportation. You might want a written         apology from a rude employee or reimbursement for some         loss you incurred-but the airline needs to know what you         want before it can decide what action to take.            * Be reasonable. If your demands are way         out of line, your letter might earn you a polite apology         and a place in the airline's crank files.            If you follow these guidelines, the         airlines will probably treat your complaint seriously.         Your letter will help them to determine what caused your         problem, as well as to suggest actions the company can         take to keep the same thing from happening to other         people.            Contacting the Department of Transportation           If you want to put your complaint about         an airline on record with DOT, you can call the Aviation         Consumer Protection Division at (202) 366-2220 to record         your complaint. Or write:           Aviation Consumer Protection Division,         C-75 U.S. Department of Transportation 400 Seventh         Street, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20590           If you write, please be sure to include         your address and a daytime telephone number, with area         code. Letters from consumers help us spot problem areas         and trends in the airline industry. We use our complaint         files to document the need for changes in DOT's consumer         protection regulations and, where warranted, as the basis         for enforcement action. In addition, every month we         publish a report with information about the number of         complaints we receive about each airline and what         problems people are having. You can write or call us for         a free single copy of this Air Travel Consumer Report,         which also has statistics that the airlines file with us         on flight delays, oversales and mishandled baggage. (Data         from recent reports are online on this home page.) If         your complaint is about something you feel is a safety or         security hazard, write to the Federal Aviation         Administration:           Assistant Administrator for System Safety         ASY-100 Federal Aviation Administration 800 Independence         Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20591           or call: (800) FAA-SURE. After office         hours, if you want to report something that you believe         is a serious safety hazard, call the Aviation Safety         Hotline at 1-800-255-1111.            Local consumer help programs           In most communities there are consumer         help groups that try to mediate complaints about         businesses, including airlines and travel agencies.           * Most state governments have a special         office that investigates consumer problems and         complaints. Sometimes it is a separate division in the         governor's or state attorney general's office. Check your         telephone book under the state government's listing.            * Many cities and counties have consumer         affairs departments that handle complaints. Often you can         register your complaint and get information over the         phone or in person.            * A number of newspapers and radio or TV         stations operate ""Hot Lines"" or ""Action         Lines"" where individual consumers can get help.         Consumer reporters, with the help of volunteers, try to         mediate complaints and may report the results as a news         item. The possible publicity encourages companies to take         fast action on consumer problems when they are referred         by the media. Some Action Lines, however, may not be able         to handle every complaint they receive. They often select         the most severe problems or those that are most         representative of the kinds of complaints they receive.            Your last resort           If nothing else works, small claims court         might be the best way for you to help yourself. Many         cities have these courts to settle disputes involving         relatively small amounts of money and to reduce the red         tape and expense that people generally fear when they sue         someone. An airline can generally be sued in small claims         court in any jurisdiction where it operates flights or         does business. You can usually get the details of how to         use the small claims court in your community by         contacting your city or county office of consumer         affairs, or the clerk of the court. As a rule, small         claims court costs are low, you don't need a lawyer, and         the procedures are much less formal and intimidating than         they are in most other types of courts.

GX005-48-14897516	"Mission Day Four                                Mission Day 4:                            For a         list of  acronyms and their definitions , please  click         here   Mission Status         Report # 06 -- December 22, 1999 - 11:30 a.m. EST                     With the Hubble Space Telescope securely latched in the payload bay, the astronauts aboard         Discovery today will turn their attention to the primary objective of their flight --         restoring the capability of the 12.5-ton telescope to observe the universe.                    Astronauts Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld are scheduled to begin the first of three         planned maintenance spacewalks today at about 1:40 p.m. The crew was awakened this morning         to the song ""Hucklebuck"" performed by Beau Jocque and the Zydeco Hi-Rollers, a         tune that the spacewalkers heard many times while training hundreds of hours for the         mission in the 6.5-million gallon water tank at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.                    Although not scheduled to begin until 1:40 p.m., Smith and Grunsfeld could begin the         planned six-hour spacewalk earlier if they complete preparations ahead of schedule. Once         outside Discovery's cabin, the first task they will perform will be to replace the         telescope's three Rate Sensor Units, each of which contains two gyrsoscopes. Of the six         gyroscopes currently installed in Hubble, four have failed. At least three operable         gyroscopes are needed to point the telescope with the accuracy required to track its         astronomical targets.                     After the rate sensor units have been installed, the two spacewalkers will then open         valves on the telescope's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer to purge         nitrogen coolant from that instrument in preparation for its servicing on the next Shuttle         maintenance mission. Next, they will install six Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits for         the Hubble's batteries that will increase the batteries' efficiency and reduce a potential         for them to overcharge and overheat. If those tasks are completed and the spacewalkers         have extra time, they may perform some additional small jobs such as installing handrail         covers and inspecting brackets.                     While Smith and Grunsfeld are outside, inside the cabin European astronaut Jean-Francois         Clervoy will control Discovery's robotic arm, maneuvering the spacewalkers into position         to work on the telescope. Discovery's other spacewalking team, astronaut Mike Foale and         European astronaut Claude Nicollier, also will assist from inside the cabin. Foale and         Nicollier are scheduled to perform the mission's second spacewalk tomorrow. Smith and         Grunsfeld are planned to again venture outside on Friday for the flight's third and final         spacewalk.                    Discovery remains in near-perfect condition with no mechanical problems of concern to         flight controllers, as has been the case since its launch on Sunday. It is orbiting at an         altitude of 380 by 365 statute miles. The next Mission Control Center status report will         be issued at 10 p.m. or as events warrant.           Mission Status Report #7 -- Dec. 23, 1999 12:30 a.m. EST           Discovery astronauts completed the two highest priority tasks of         their Hubble Space Telescope servicing Wednesday with a space walk that was the second         longest in history. Astronauts Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld installed six new gyroscopes         and six Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits in the telescope during their 8 hour, 15         minute spacewalk.                    Working deliberately, Smith and Grunsfeld replaced three Rate Sensor Units, each         containing two gyroscopes. Four of Hubble’s gyroscopes had failed, making the         telescope unable to point itself precisely enough to do science since Nov. 13. At least         three operable gyroscopes are needed to point the telescope with the accuracy required to         track its astronomical targets.                    The spacewalkers also installed Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits on wiring from         Hubble’s solar arrays to each of its six batteries. The kits are designed to improve         control of the charging of the space telescope’s 10-year-old batteries.                    With Hubble latched upright in the payload bay, Smith and Grunsfeld completed all major         tasks scheduled for the first of three spacewalks on three consecutive days. A few minor         objectives, including applying lubricant to the door of one of the telescope’s bays         and taking close-up photos of the Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits, were left undone.         Flight and telescope controllers decided to cancel the photography job and schedule the         10-minute lubrication job for Thursday’s space walk. The duration of the spac ewalk         was second only to the 8 hour, 29 minute space walk from Endeavour on STS-49 in May 1992.                    A few minor problems helped account for the length of the space walk. One of the old         gyroscope-containing Rate Sensor Units was a tight fit in the box designed to protect it         on its return to Earth, though eventually it was placed inside and the lid closed. Another         involved opening valves and removing caps on the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object         Spectrometer, in preparation for restoring it to operation during the next Hubble         Servicing mission. That task too eventually was completed.                    All in all flight and telescope controllers were delighted with the accomplishments of the         day.                    Major tasks on Thursday's space walk by Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier include         replacement of Hubble’s outmoded DF-224 computer with a more modern unit 20 times         faster and with six times the memory. They also will replace one of Hubble’s three         fine guidance sensors, used to precisely point the telescope and gather scientific data.         The astronauts also may perform “get-ahead tasks,” some first scheduled for a         fourth space walk. That space walk was cancelled because of delays in Discovery’s         launch.                    Discovery remains in excellent condition, in an orbit with a high point of 380 statute         miles and a low point of 369 miles. The next status report will be issued at 11 a.m. or as         events warrant.                                                                                GSFC         PAO HST 3A Main Page (text only site)           Thumbnails         from Mission Day Four           GSFC Home Page  (NOT text only)           HST Project Homepage  (NOT text         only)                     We are interested in         what you think, so please send us your  comments .

Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government, detected a distress signal from the fishing vessel Ranger. The Coast Guard received an Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) distress alert from the 107-foot vessel homeported in Port Elizabeth, N.J. The alert started a search and rescue mission that used f ive rescue planes and helicopters from Coast Guard units in three states to rescue the seven men. Resc ue pl N.C., a resc ue pl helicopters from which took place ane s and helic opte rs fr om Co ast G uard Air St atio n Eliza beth City, ane from Coas t Gua rd Air Stat ion Ca pe Co d, Ma ss., as well as two Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City all were involved with the rescue in the early morning hours 80 miles east of Atlantic City.  Arriving at the Ranger, the rescue crew hoisted five fishermen to the safety of the heli copt er. A C oast Guar d Res cue S wimme r staye d beh ind in the l ife raft with two remaining fisherman in the 10-15 foot seas and 25 mph winds awaiting rescue from a second Coast Guard rescue helicopter. The Rescue Swimmer and the two remaining fisherman were rescued about 45 minutes later. All the fishermen were taken back to Coast Guard Group Air Station Atlant ic City and met by awaiting ambulance and EMS from Atlantic City International Airport. Six of the seven were released with one going to a local hospital. ""These fishermen helped us save their lives. The EPIRB told us where to search, survival suits kept them warm and their life raft kept them out of the frigid water until our people could get them to safety,"" said Captain Bob Durfey, Commanding Officer of Coast Guard Group Air-Station Atlantic City. The Coast Guard strongly recommends having charts, a global positioning device and reliable means of communication on board. It is critically important that - more -2-   mariners rely on a VHF-FM radio and EPIRBs as their primary means of communicating a distress. ""This particular rescue once again demo nstrates the eff ectiveness of the CopasSarsat System and NOAA's commitment to protecting lives and property,"" said retired Navy Vice Admiral Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosp here and NOAA administrato r. ""Truly, Cospas-Sarsat works to take the `search' out of search and rescue."" The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA Satellite and Information Service) represents the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center. NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole. Em ergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's facility in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 35 countries participating in the system. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA Satellites and Information) is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellites and Information operates the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring and other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone mon itoring and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA Satellites and Info rmation also operates three data centers, which house global da ta base s in clima tology, oce anograp hy, solid e arth geop hysics, ma rine geolo gy and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and paleoclimatology. The Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our na tion's coastal and marine resource s.

Tenth Revised Edition, September 1994           INTRODUCTION           The elimination of government economic         regulation of the airlines has resulted in lower fares and a wide         variety of price/service options. In this new commercial environment,         consumers have had to take a more active role in choosing their air         service by learning to ask a number of questions.                       Am I more concerned with price or             scheduling? Am I willing to fly at an odd hour if it means saving             $25?             Will the airline penalize me for             changing my reservation?             What will the airline do for me if it             cancels my flight?                     This booklet is designed to explain your         rights and responsibilities as an air traveler. We hope it helps you         become a resourceful consumer.           AIR         FARES           Because of the emphasis on price         competition, consumers may choose from a wide variety of air fares. Some         airlines are trying a ""back to basics"" approach-offering         flights at bargain basement prices with few extras. For fare         information, you can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or an         airline serving the places you want to visit. Ask them to tell you the         names of all airlines flying there. A travel agent can find virtually         all airlines' fares in his or her computer. Or, if you prefer you can         call each airline to ask about the fares they charge, particularly any         special promotional fares they may be offering at the time. You can also         pay attention to newspaper and radio ads, where airlines advertise many         of the discount plans that apply to your city. Finally, be alert to new         companies serving the market. They may offer lower fares or different         services than older established airlines. Here are some tips to help you         decide among air fares:                       Be flexible in your travel plans in             order to get the lowest fare. The best deals may be limited to             travel on certain days of the week or particular hours of the day.             After you get a fare quote, ask the reservations agent if you could             save even more by leaving a day earlier or later, or by taking a             different flight on the same day.             Plan as far ahead as you can. Some             airlines set aside only a few seats on each flight at the lower             rates. The real bargains often sell out very quickly. On the other             hand, air carriers sometimes make more discount seats available             later. If you had decided against a trip because the discount fare             you wanted was not available on the desired date, try again,             especially just before the advance-purchase deadline.             Some airlines may have discounts that             others don't offer. In a large metropolitan area, the fare could             depend on which airport you use. Also, a connection (change of             planes) or a one-stop flight is sometimes cheaper than a nonstop.             Does the air fare include types of             service that airlines have traditionally provided, such as meals or             free baggage handling? If you have a connection involving two             airlines, will your bags be transferred? Can you get advance seat             assignments? If you are stranded, will the ticket be good on another             carrier at no extra charge? Will the first airline pay for meals or             hotel rooms during the wait?             Many discount fares are             non-refundable; if you buy one of these fares and later cancel your             trip, you will not get your money back. Some fares also have a             penalty for changing flights or dates even if you don't want a             refund. You may also have to pay any difference in air fares if your             fare is not available on the new flight.             Some airlines will not increase the             fare after the ticket is issued and paid for. (Simply holding a             reservation without a ticket does not guarantee the fare.) Other             airlines may reserve the right to collect more money from you if the             fare that you had purchased goes up before departure time. Find out             from the airline before you buy your ticket what its policy is on             assessing fare increases after the ticket is purchased.             After you buy your ticket, call the             airline or travel agent once or twice before departure to check the             fare. Fares change all the time, and if that same fare goes down             before you fly, some airlines will refund the difference. But you             have to ask.                     Differences in air fares can be         substantial. Careful comparison shopping among airlines does take time,         but it can lead to real savings.           RESERVATIONS         AND TICKETS           Once you decide when and where you want         to go, and which airline you want to use, getting reservations and         tickets is a fairly simple process. You can make all of your         arrangements by telephone, at the airline's ticket office, or through a         travel agent or other ticket outlet. There are a few potential pitfalls,         however, and these pointers should help you avoid them.                       If your travel plans fall into a busy             period, call for reservations early. Flights for holidays may sell             out weeks-sometimes months-ahead of time. Don't buy a standby fare             or an 'open return' ticket if you need to fly during a high-demand             period, especially the end of August. You could be stranded for a             week or more before a seat becomes available.             Ask the reservations agent to give you             the on-time performance code for any flights that you are             considering. This is a one-digit code in the reservations computer             that shows how often that flight arrived on time (within 15 minutes)             during the most recent reported month. For example, an ""8""             means that flight arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival             time between 80% and 89.9% of the time. If you are deciding between             two flights with similar schedules and fares, you may want to choose             the one with the better on-time record. (Only the largest U.S.             airlines are required to maintain these codes.)             When you make a reservation, be sure             the agent records the information accurately. Before you hang up or             leave the ticket office, review all of the essential information             with the agent-the spelling of your name, the flight numbers and             travel dates, and the cities you are traveling between. If there is             more than one airport at either city, be sure you check which one             you'll be using. It's also important to give the airline your home             and work telephone numbers so they can let you know if there is any             change in their schedule.             Your ticket will show the flight             number, departure time, date, and status of your reservation for             each flight of your itinerary. The ""status"" box is             important. ""OK"" means you're confirmed. Anything else             means that the reservation is not yet certain (e.g., waitlisted).             A ""direct"" (or             ""through"") flight can have one or more stops. Sometimes             flights with only one flight number can even involve a change of             planes. Ask about your exact routing.             If you are flying to a small city and             your flight number has four digits, you may be booked on a commuter             airline that has an agreement with the major carrier in whose name             the flight is held out. If you are unsure, ask the reservations             agent about the airline and the aircraft type; these flights are             identified in the computer.             When a reservations agent asks you to             buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a deadline. And             if you don't make the deadline, the airline may cancel your             reservations without telling you.             Try to have your tickets in hand             before you go to the airport. This speeds your check-in and helps             you avoid some of the tension you might otherwise feel if you had to             wait in a slow-moving ticketing line and worry about missing your             flight.             If your reservations are booked far             enough ahead of time, the airline may offer to mail your tickets to             you. However, if you don't receive the tickets and the airline's             records show that they mailed them, you may have to go through             cumbersome lost-ticket procedures (see the end of this chapter). It             is safer to check the telephone directory for a conveniently located             travel agency or airline ticket office and buy your tickets there.             As soon as you receive your ticket             check to make sure all the information on it is correct, especially             the airports (if any of the cities have more than one) and the             flight dates. Have any necessary corrections made immediately.             Bring a photo I.D. when you fly, and             have your airline ticket issued using your name as it appears on             that I.D. Many airlines are requesting such identification at             check-in in order to reduce the re- selling of discount tickets.             (Airlines don't permit tickets to be sold or given to other             persons.) On international flights, make sure your name is the same             on your ticket and your passport. If your name has recently changed             and the name on your ticket and your I.D. are different, bring             documentation of the change (e.g., a marriage certificate or court             order).             It's a good idea to reconfirm your             reservations before you start your trip; flight schedules sometimes             change. On international trips, most airlines require that you             reconfirm your onward or return reservations at least 72 hours             before each flight. If you don't, your reservations may be canceled.             Check your ticket as you board each             flight to ensure that only the correct coupon has been removed by             the airline agent.                     Paying for and refunding airline         tickets                       If you plan to pay in person and with             your own bank check, take at least two forms of identification with             you like a driver's license, major credit card, or employee I.D.             card. Particularly when you purchase tickets far from your home             town, airlines, travel agencies and other ticket outlets will want             to confirm your identity.             If you paid for your ticket with cash             and you have a refundable fare, you can often get an immediate             refund from the issuing airline or travel agency. If you paid by             personal check, the refund will generally have to be mailed to you.             NOTE: In some cases tickets purchased overseas in foreign currency             can only be refunded in that same currency and country, due to             foreign government monetary restrictions. Keep this in mind if you             are considering buying a ticket in a foreign country.             When you pay by credit card, your             charge account is billed-whether you use your tickets or not. You             won't receive credit unless the original unused tickets are returned             to the airline. You usually can't get a cash refund for a credit             card purchase.             If you buy your tickets with a credit             card and then change your flights, the ticket agent may want to             credit the amount of the old tickets and issue another set with a             second charge to your account. You may want to insist that the value             of your old tickets be applied to the new ones, with the difference             in price charged or credited to your account. While this creates a             little extra work for the airlines, it prevents double-billing to             your charge account.                     Payment by credit card provides certain         protections under federal credit laws. When a refund is due, the airline         must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days         after receiving a complete refund application. If you paid by credit         card for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a refund that         you are due, report this in writing to your credit card company. If you         write to them within 60 days from the time that they mailed your first         monthly statement showing the charge for the airline ticket, the card         company should credit your account even if the airline doesn't. This         procedure is particularly useful if your airline ceases operations         before your flight.           Lost tickets           Airline tickets are similar to negotiable         documents. Because of this, refunds can be difficult to obtain if         tickets are lost or stolen. Many passengers believe that air tickets can         be replaced as easily as travelers checks just because the reservation         is in the computer, but that is not the case. Your ticket number may be         shown on your credit card receipt or travel agency itinerary. If it is         not, jot down the number on a sheet of paper and carry it separately         from your ticket. Bring it with you on your trip. If the ticket does go         astray, the airline can process your refund application more quickly,         and perhaps issue an on-the-spot replacement ticket, if you can give         them this number. You should report a lost ticket immediately to the         airline that is shown as the issuing carrier at the top of the ticket.         You may be required to repurchase a ticket in order to continue your         trip. If you no longer meet all of the restrictions on your discount         fare (e.g., seven-day advance purchase) the new ticket may cost more         than the old one did. In that event, however, it is generally the higher         fare that is eventually refunded, as long as you don't change any of the         cities, flights or dates on your trip. Once the airline establishes that         you actually bought the ticket, they will begin processing your refund         application. There is often a waiting period of two to six months. If         anyone uses or cashes in your ticket while the refund is pending, the         airline may refuse to give you your money back. Finally, there is a         handling charge that the airline may deduct from the refund. All in all,         getting a refund or replacement for a lost ticket is a lot of trouble,         and there's no guarantee you'll receive either one. So the best advice         is-don't lose the ticket in the first place.           DELAYED         AND CANCELED FLIGHTS           Airlines don't guarantee their schedules,         and you should realize this when planning your trip. There are many         things that can-and often do-make it impossible for flights to arrive on         time. Some of these problems, like bad weather, air traffic delays, and         mechanical repairs, are hard to predict and beyond the airlines'         control. If your flight is delayed, try to find out how late it will be.         But keep in mind that it is sometimes difficult for airlines to estimate         the total duration of a delay during its early stages. In so- called         ""creeping delays,"" developments occur which were not         anticipated when the carrier made its initial estimate of the length of         the delay. Weather that had been forecast to improve can instead         deteriorate, or a mechanical problem can turn out to be more complex         than initially determined. If the problem is with local weather or air         traffic control, all flights will probably be late and there's not much         you or the airline can do to speed up your departure. If there's a         mechanical problem with the plane for your particular flight or if the         crew is delayed on an incoming flight, you might be better off trying to         arrange another flight, as long as you don't have to pay a cancellation         penalty or higher fare for changing your reservations. (It is sometimes         easier to make such arrangements from a pay phone than at a ticket         counter.) If you find a flight on another airline, ask the first airline         to endorse your ticket to the new carrier; this could save you a fare         increase. Remember, however, that there is no rule requiring them to do         this. If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you on the         first flight of theirs to your destination on which space is available,         at no additional charge. If this involves a significant delay find out         if another carrier has space, and ask the first airline to endorse your         ticket. Finding extra seats may be difficult, however, especially over         holidays and other peak travel times.           Each airline has its own policies about         what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the airport; there are         no federal requirements. If you are delayed, ask the airline staff if         they will pay for meals or a phone call. Some airlines, often those         charging very low fares, do not provide any amenities to stranded         passengers. Others may not offer amenities if the delay is caused by bad         weather or something else beyond the airline's control. Contrary to         popular belief, airlines are not required to compensate passengers whose         flights are delayed or canceled. As discussed in the chapter on         overbooking, compensation is required by law only when you are         ""bumped"" from a flight that is oversold. Airlines almost         always refuse to pay passengers for financial losses resulting from a         delayed flight. If the purpose of your trip is to close a potentially         lucrative business deal, to give a speech or lecture, to attend a family         function, or to be present at any time-sensitive event, you might want         to allow a little extra leeway and take an earlier flight. In other         words, airline delays and cancellations aren't unusual, and defensive         counter- planning is a good idea when time is your most important         consideration. When booking your flight remember that a departure early         in the day is less likely to be delayed than a later flight, due to         ""ripple"" effects throughout the day. Also, if an early flight         does get delayed or canceled, you have more rerouting options. If you         book the last flight of the day and it is canceled, you could get stuck         overnight. You may select a connection (change of planes) over a nonstop         or direct flight because of the convenient departure time or lower fare.         However, a change of planes always involves the possibility of a         misconnection. If you have a choice of connections and the fares and         service are equivalent, choose the one with the least-congested         connecting airport, so it will be easier to get to your second flight.         You may wish to take into consideration the potential for adverse         weather if you have a choice of connecting cities. When making your         reservation for a connection, always check the amount of time between         flights. Ask yourself what will happen if the first flight is delayed;         if you don't like the answer, pick another flight or ask the agent to         ""construct"" a connection that allows more time.           OVERBOOKING           Overbooking is not illegal, and most         airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain extent in order         to compensate for ""no-shows."" Passengers are sometimes left         behind or ""bumped"" as a result. When an oversale occurs, the         Department of Transportation (DOT) requires airlines to ask people who         aren't in a hurry to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for         compensation. Those passengers bumped against their will are, with a few         exceptions, entitled to compensation.           Voluntary bumping           Almost any group of airline passengers         includes some people with urgent travel needs and others who may be more         concerned about the cost of their tickets than about getting to their         destination on time. Our rules require airlines to seek out people who         are willing to give up their seats for some compensation before bumping         anyone in- voluntarily. Here's how this works. At the check-in or         boarding area, airline employees will look for volunteers when it         appears that the flight has been oversold. If you're not in a rush to         arrive at your next destination, you can give your reservation back to         the airline in exchange for compensation and a later flight. But before         you do this, you may want to get answers to these important questions:                       When is the next flight on which the             airline can confirm your seat? The alternate flight may be just as             acceptable to you. On the other hand, if they offer to put you on             standby on another flight that's full, you could be stranded.             Will the airline provide other             amenities such as free meals, a hotel room, phone calls, or ground             transportation? If not, you might have to spend the money they offer             you on food or lodging while you wait for the next flight.                     DOT has not said how much the airline has         to give volunteers. This means carriers may negotiate with their         passengers for a mutually acceptable amount of money-or maybe a free         trip or other benefits. Airlines give employees guidelines for         bargaining with passengers, and they may select those volunteers willing         to sell back their reservations for the lowest price. If the airline         offers you a free ticket, ask about restrictions. How long is the ticket         good for? Is it ""blacked out"" during holiday periods when you         might want to use it? Can it be used for international flights? Most         importantly, can you make a reservation, and if so, how far before         departure are you permitted to make it?           Involuntary bumping           DOT requires each airline to give all         passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written statement describing         their rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an         oversold flight and who doesn't. Those travelers who don't get to fly         are frequently entitled to an on-the-spot payment of denied boarding         compensation. The amount depends on the price of their ticket and the         length of the delay:                       If you are bumped involuntarily and             the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to             get you to your final destination (including later connections)             within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time, there is no             compensation.             If the airline arranges substitute             transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination             between one and two hours after your original arrival time (between             one and four hours on international flights), the airline must pay             you an amount equal to your one-way fare to your final destination,             with a $200 maximum.             If the substitute transportation is             scheduled to get you to your destination more than two hours later             (four hours internationally), or if the airline does not make any             substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles             (200% of your fare, $400 maximum).             You always get to keep your original             ticket and use it on another flight. If you choose to make your own             arrangements, you can request an ""involuntary refund"" for             the ticket for the flight you were bumped from. The denied boarding             compensation is essentially a payment for your inconvenience.                     Like all rules, however, there are a few         conditions and exceptions:                       To be eligible for compensation, you             must have a confirmed reservation. An ""OK"" in the Status             box of your ticket qualifies you in this regard even if the airline             can't find your reservation in the computer, as long as you didn't             cancel your reservation or miss a reconfirmation deadline.             You must meet the airline's deadline             for buying your ticket. Discount tickets must usually be purchased             within a certain number of days after the reservation was made.             Other tickets normally have to be picked up no later than 30 minutes             before the flight.                     In addition to the ticketing deadline,         each airline has a check-in deadline, which is the amount of time before         scheduled departure that you must present yourself to the airline at the         airport. For domestic flights most carriers have a deadline of 10         minutes before scheduled departure, but some can be an hour or longer.         (Many airlines require passengers with advance seat assignments to check         in 30 minutes before scheduled departure, even if they already have         advance boarding passes. If you miss this deadline you may lose the         specific seats you were promised, although not the reservation itself.)         Check-in deadlines on international flights can be as much as three         hours before scheduled departure time, due partially to security         procedures. Some airlines may simply require you to be at the         ticket/baggage counter by this time; most, however, require that you get         all the way to the boarding area. If you miss the ticketing or check-in         deadline, you may have lost your reservation and your right to         compensation if the flight is oversold.                       As noted above, no compensation is due             if the airline arranges substitute transportation which is scheduled             to arrive at your destination within one hour of your originally             scheduled arrival time.             If the airline must substitute a             smaller plane for the one it originally planned to use, the carrier             isn't required to pay people who are bumped as a result.             The rules do not apply to charter             flights, or to scheduled flights operated with planes that hold 60             or fewer passengers. They don't apply to international flights             inbound to the United States, although some airlines on these routes             may follow them voluntarily. Also, if you are flying between two             foreign cities-from Paris to Rome, for example-these rules will not             apply. The European Community has a rule on bumpings that occur in             an EC country; ask the airline for details, or contact DOT.                     The most effective way to reduce the risk         of being bumped is to get to the airport early. On oversold flights the         last passengers to check in are usually the first to be bumped, even if         they have met the check-in deadline. Allow extra time; assume that the         airport access road is backed up, the parking lot is full, and there is         a long line at the check-in counter. However, if you arrive so early         that your airline has another flight to your destination leaving before         the one that you are booked on, either switch to the earlier flight or         don't check your bag until after the first flight leaves. If you check         your bag right away, it might get put on the earlier flight and remain         unattended at your destination airport for hours. Airlines may offer         free transportation on future flights in place of a check for denied         boarding compensation. However, if you are bumped involuntarily you have         the right to insist on a check if that is your preference. Once you cash         the check (or accept the free flight), you will probably lose the right         to demand more money from the airline later on. However, if being bumped         costs you more money than the airline will pay you at the airport, you         can try to negotiate a higher settlement with their complaint         department. If this doesn't work, you usually have 30 days from the date         on the check to decide if you want to accept the amount of the check.         You are always free to decline the check and take the airline to court         to try to obtain more compensation. The government's denied boarding         regulation spells out the airlines' minimum obligation to people they         bump involuntarily. Finally, don't be a ""no-show."" If you are         holding confirmed reservations you don't plan to use, notify the         airline. If you don't, they will cancel all onward or return         reservations on your trip.           BAGGAGE           Between the time you check your luggage         in and the time you claim it at your destination, it may have passed         through a maze of conveyor belts and baggage carts; once airborne,         baggage may tumble around the cargo compartment if the plane hits rough         air. In all fairness to the airlines, however, relatively few bags are         damaged or lost. With some common-sense packing and other precautions,         your bags will probably be among the ones that arrive safely.           Packing           You can pack to avoid problems. Some         items should never be put into a bag you plan to check into the cargo         compartment:                       Small valuables: cash, credit cards,             jewelry, cameras.             Critical items: medicine, keys,             passport, tour vouchers, business papers.             Irreplaceable items: manuscript,             heirlooms.             Fragile items: eyeglasses, glass             containers, liquids.                     Things like this should be carried on         your person or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit under the seat.         Remember, the only way to be sure your valuables are not damaged or lost         is to keep them with you. Even if your bag is not lost, it could be         delayed for a day or two. Don't put perishables in a checked bag; they         may spoil if it is delayed. It is wise to put items that you will need         during the first 24 hours in a carry-on bag (e.g. toiletries, a change         of underwear). Check with the airline for its limits on the size,         weight, or number of carry-on pieces. (There is no single federal         standard.) If you are using more than one airline, check on all of them.         Inquire about your flight; different airplanes can have different         limits. Don't assume that the flight will have unlimited closet space         for carry-on garment bags; some may have to be checked. If you plan to         go shopping at your destination and bring your purchases aboard as         carry-on, keep the limits in mind. If you check these purchases,         however, carry the receipts separately; they may be necessary for a         claim if the merchandise is lost or damaged. Don't put anything into a         carry-on bag that could be considered a weapon (e.g. scissors, pen         knife).           Checked baggage is also subject to         limits. On most domestic and international flights, it's two checked         bags (three if you don't have any carry-on luggage). There can be an         extra charge if you bring more, or if you exceed the airline's limits on         the size of the bags. On some flights between two foreign cities, your         allowance may be based on the weight of the bags rather than the number         of pieces. The same two bags that cost you nothing to check when you         started your trip could result in expensive excess-baggage charges under         a weight system. Ask the airlines about the limit for every segment of         your international trip before you leave home, especially if you have a         stopover of a day or two or if you are changing carriers. The bags you         check should be labeled- inside and out-with your name, address and         phone number. Add the name and address of a person to contact at your         destination if it's practical to do so. Almost all of the bags that are         misplaced by airlines do turn up sooner or later. With proper labeling,         the bag and its owner can usually be reunited within a few hours. Don't         overpack a bag. This puts pressure on the latches, making it easier for         them to pop open. Also, lock your bags. The locks aren't very effective         against pilferage, but they help to keep the latches from springing. If         you plan to check any electrical equipment, glassware, small appliances,         pottery, typewriters, musical instruments or other fragile items, they         should be packed in a container specifically designed to survive rough         handling* preferably a factory-sealed carton or a padded hard- shell         carrying case.           Check-in           Don't check in at the last minute. Even         if you make the flight, your bag may not. If you miss the airline's         check-in deadline, the carrier might not assume liability for your bag         if it is delayed or lost. If you have a choice, select flights that         minimize the potential for baggage disruption. The likelihood of a bag         going astray increases from #1 to #4 below (i.e., #1 is safest): 1)         nonstop flight 2) direct or 'through' flight (one or more stops, but no         change of aircraft) 3) online connection (change of aircraft but not         airlines) 4) interline connection (change of aircraft and airlines) When         you check in, remove straps and hooks from garment bags that you are         sending as checked baggage. These can get caught in baggage processing         machinery, causing damage to the bag. The airline will put baggage         destination tags on your luggage and give you the stubs to use as claim         checks. Make sure you get a stub for every bag. Don't throw them away         until after you get your bags back and you check the contents. Not only         will you need them if a claim is necessary, but you may need to show         them to security upon leaving the baggage-claim area. Each tag has a         three-letter code and flight number that show the baggage sorters on         which plane and to which airport your luggage is supposed to go.         Double-check the tag before your bags go down the conveyor belt. (The         airline will be glad to tell you the code for your destination when you         make reservations or buy your tickets.) Your bags may only be checked to         one of your intermediate stops rather than your destination city if you         must clear Customs short of your final destination, or if you are taking         a connection involving two airlines that don't have an interline         agreement. Be sure all of the tags from previous trips are removed from         your bag, since they may confuse busy baggage handlers.           Claiming your bags           Many bags look alike. After you pull what         you think is your bag off the carousel, check the name tag or the bag         tag number. If your bag arrives open, unlocked or visibly damaged, check         right away to see if any of the contents are missing or damaged. Report         any problems to the airline before leaving the airport; insist on         filling out a form. Open your suitcase immediately when you get to where         you are staying. Any damage to the contents or any pilferage should be         immediately reported to the airline by telephone. Make a note of the         date and time of the call, and the name and telephone number of the         person you spoke with. Follow up immediately with a certified letter to         the airline.           Damage           If your suitcase arrives smashed or torn,         the airline will usually pay for repairs. If it can't be fixed, they         will negotiate a settlement to pay you its depreciated value. The same         holds true for belongings packed inside. Airlines may decline to pay for         damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or inadequate         packing, rather than the airline's rough handling. Carriers may also         refuse to give you money for your damaged items inside the bag when         there's no evidence of external damage to the suitcase. But airlines         generally don't disclaim liability for fragile merchandise packed in its         original factory sealed carton, a cardboard mailing tube, or other         container designed for shipping and packed with protective padding         material. When you check in, airline personnel should let you know if         they think your suitcase or package may not survive the trip intact.         Before accepting a questionable item, they will ask you to sign a         statement in which you agree to check it at your own risk. But even if         you do sign this form, the airline might be liable for damage if it is         caused by its own negligence shown by external injury to the suitcase or         package.           Delayed bags           If you and your suitcase don't connect at         your destination, don't panic. The airlines have very sophisticated         systems that track down about 98% of the bags they misplace and return         them to their owners within hours. In many cases they will absorb         reasonable expenses you incur while they look for your missing         belongings. You and the airline may have different ideas of what's         reasonable, however, and the amount they will pay is subject to         negotiation.           If your bags don't come off the conveyor         belt, report this to the airline before you leave the airport. Insist         that they fill out a form and give you a copy, even if they say the bag         will be in on the next flight. If the form doesn't contain the name of         the person who filled it out, ask for it. Get an appropriate phone         number for following up (not the Reservations number). Don't assume that         the airline will deliver the bag without charge when it is found; ask         them about this. Most carriers set guidelines for their airport         employees that allow them to disburse some money at the airport for         emergency purchases. The amount depends on whether or not you're away         from home and how long it takes to track down your bags and return them         to you. If the airline does not provide you a cash advance, it may still         reimburse you later for the purchase of necessities. Discuss with the         carrier the types of articles that would be reimbursable, and keep all         receipts. If the airline misplaces sporting equipment, it will sometimes         pay for the rental of replacements. For replacement clothing or other         articles, the carrier might offer to absorb only a portion of the         purchase cost, on the basis that you will be able to use the new items         in the future. (The airline may agree to a higher reimbursement if you         turn the articles over to them.) When you've checked in fresh foods or         any other perishable goods and they are ruined because their delivery is         delayed, the airline won't reimburse you. Carriers may be liable if they         lose or damage perishable items, but they won't accept responsibility         for spoilage caused by a delay in delivery. Airlines are liable for         provable consequential damages up to the amount of their liability limit         (see below) in connection with the delay. If you can't resolve the claim         with the airline's airport staff, keep a record of the names of the         employees with whom you dealt, and hold on to all travel documents and         receipts for any money you spent in connection with the mishandling.         (It's okay to surrender your baggage claim tags to the airline when you         fill out a form at the airport, as long as you get a copy of the form         and it notes that you gave up the tags.) Call or write the airline's         consumer office when you get home.           Lost luggage           Once your bag is declared officially         lost, you will have to submit a claim. This usually means you have to         fill out a second, more detailed form. Check on this; failure to         complete the second form when required could delay your claim. Missing         the deadline for filing it could invalidate your claim altogether. The         airline will usually refer your claim form to a central office, and the         negotiations between you and the airline will begin. If your flight was         a connection involving two carriers, the final carrier is normally the         one responsible for processing your claim even if it appears that the         first airline lost the bag. Airlines don't automatically pay the full         amount of every claim they receive. First, they will use the information         on your form to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Like         insurance companies, airlines consider the depreciated value of your         possessions, not their original price or the replacement costs. If         you're tempted to exaggerate your claim, don't. Airlines may completely         deny claims they feel are inflated or fraudulent. They often ask for         sales receipts and other documentation to back up claims, especially if         a large amount of money is involved. If you don't keep extensive         records, you can expect to dicker with the airline over the value of         your goods. Generally, it takes an airline anywhere from six weeks to         three months to pay you for your lost luggage. When they tender a         settlement, they may offer you the option of free tickets on future         flights in a higher amount than the cash payment. Ask about all         restrictions on these tickets, such as ""blackout"" periods and         how far before departure you are permitted to make a reservation.           Limits on liability           If your bags are delayed, lost or damaged         on a domestic trip, the airline can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per         passenger on the amount of money they'll pay you. When your luggage and         its contents are worth more than that, you may want to purchase         ""excess valuation,"" if available, from the airline as you         check in. This is not insurance, but it will increase the carrier's         potential liability. The airline may refuse to sell excess valuation on         some items that are especially valuable or breakable, such as antiques,         musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts, negotiable securities and         cash. On international trips, the liability limit is set by a treaty         called the Warsaw Convention. Unless you buy excess valuation, the         liability limit is $9.07 per pound ($20 per kilo). In order to limit its         liability to this amount, the airline must use one of the following         procedures:                       The carrier weighs your bags at             check-in and records this weight on your ticket. The airline's             maximum liability to you is that weight multiplied by $9.07 (or by             $20, if the weight was recorded in kilos).             Instead of weighing your luggage, the             carrier assumes that each of your bags weighs the maximum that it             agrees to accept as checked baggage, usually 70 pounds (32 kilos).             This yields a liability limit of about $640 per bag.                     This international limit also applies to         domestic segments of an international journey. This is the case even if         the domestic and international flights are on separate tickets and you         claim and re-check your bag between the two flights. Keep in mind that         the liability limits are maximums. If the depreciated value of your         property is worth less than the liability limit, this lower amount is         what you will be offered. If the airline's settlement doesn't fully         reimburse your loss, check your homeowner's or renter's insurance; it         sometimes covers losses away from the residence. Some credit card         companies and travel agencies offer optional or even automatic         supplemental baggage coverage.           Hazardous Items           Except for toiletries and medicines         totaling no more than 75 ounces, it is illegal and extremely dangerous         to carry on board or check in your luggage any of the following         hazardous materials:                       Aerosols: Polishes, waxes, degreasers,             cleaners, etc.             Corrosives: Acids, cleaners, wet cell             batteries, etc.             Flammables: Paints, thinners, lighter             fluid, liquid reservoir lighters, cleaners, adhesives, camp stoves             or portable gas equipment with fuel, etc.             Explosives: Fireworks, flares, signal             devices, loaded firearms, gunpowder, etc. (Small arms ammunition for             personal use may be transported in checked luggage if it is securely             packed in material designed for that purpose. These may not be             placed in carry-on baggage.)             Radioactives: Betascopes,             radiopharmaceuticals, uninstalled pacemakers, etc.             Compressed gases: Tear gas or             protective- type sprays, oxygen cylinders, divers' tanks (unless             they're empty), etc.             Infectious substances             Poisonous materials: Rat poison, etc.                     Matches (both 'strike anywhere' matches         and safety or 'book' matches) may only be carried on your person. If you         must travel with any of these materials, check with the airline's air         freight department to see if special arrangements can be made. A         violation of the hazardous materials restrictions can result in a civil         penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation or a criminal penalty of up         to $500,000 and/or up to 5 years in jail.           SMOKING           Under U.S. government rules, smoking is         prohibited on all domestic scheduled-service flights except for flights         over six hours to or from Alaska or Hawaii. This ban applies to domestic         segments of international flights, on both U.S. and foreign airlines         (e.g., the Chicago / New York leg of a flight that operates Chicago/ New         York / London). The ban does not apply to nonstop international flights,         even during the time that they are in U.S. airspace (e.g., a Chicago /         London flight). The prohibition applies in the passenger cabin and         lavatories, but not in the cockpit. Smoking is also banned on other         scheduled-service flights by U.S. airlines that are operated with planes         seating fewer than 30 passengers (e.g., certain ""commuter""         flights to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean). Cigar and pipe smoking is         banned on all U.S.-carrier flights (scheduled and charter, domestic and         international). The following rules apply to U.S. airlines on flights         where smoking is not banned (e.g. international flights, domestic         charter flights). These regulations do not apply to foreign airlines;         however, most of them provide non-smoking sections (although they may         not guarantee seating there or expand the section).                       The airline must provide a seat in a             non-smoking section to every passenger who asks for one, as long as             the passenger complies with the carrier's seat assignment deadline             and procedures. (Standby passengers do not have this right.)             If necessary, the airline must expand             the non- smoking section to accommodate the passengers described             above.             The airline does not have to provide a             non-smoking seat of the passenger's choice. It doesn't have to seat             you with your traveling companion, and you don't have the right to             specify a window or aisle non-smoking seat. Also, the airline is not             required by this rule to provide advance seat assignments before the             flight date in the non-smoking section, as long as they get you into             the non-smoking section on the day of your flight.             The flight crew must act to keep             passengers from smoking in the non-smoking sections. However, smoke             that drifts from the smoking section into the non-smoking section             does not constitute a violation.             No smoking is allowed while an             aircraft is on the ground or when the ventilation system is not             fully functioning.             Carriers are not required to have a             smoking section. An airline is free to ban smoking on a particular             flight, or on all of its flights.                     None of the regulations described in this         chapter apply to charter flights performed with small aircraft by         on-demand air taxi operators.           PASSENGERS         WITH DISABILITIES           Over 40 million Americans have         disabilities. The Air Carrier Access Act and the DOT rule that         implements it set out procedures designed to ensure that these         individuals have the same opportunity as anyone else to enjoy a pleasant         flight. Here are some of the major provisions of the rule.                       A person may not be refused             transportation on the basis of disability or be required to have an             attendant or produce a medical certificate, except in certain             limited circumstances specified in the rule.             Airlines must provide enplaning,             deplaning and connecting assistance, including both personnel and             equipment. (Some small commuter aircraft may not be accessible to             passengers with severe mobility impairments. When making plans to             fly to small cities, such passengers should check on the aircraft             type and its accessibility.)             Airport terminals and airline             reservations centers must have TDD telephone devices for persons             with hearing or speech impairments.             Passengers with vision or hearing             impairments must have timely access to the same information given to             other passengers at the airport or on the plane concerning gate             assignments, delayed flights, safety, etc.             New widebody aircraft must have a             wheelchair- accessible lavatory and an on-board wheelchair. Airlines             must put an on-board wheelchair on most other flights upon a             passenger's request (48 hours notice required).             Air carriers must accept wheelchairs             as checked baggage, and cannot require passengers to sign liability             waivers for them (except for pre-existing damage).             Most new airplanes must have movable             armrests on half the aisle seats, and on-board stowage for one             folding passenger wheelchair.             Carriers must allow service animals to             accompany passengers in the cabin, as long as they don't block the             aisle or other emergency evacuation route.             FAA safety rules establish standards             for passengers allowed to sit in emergency exit rows; such persons             must be able to perform certain evacuation-related functions.             FAA rules also prohibit passengers             from bringing their own oxygen. Most airlines will provide             aircraft-approved oxygen for a fee, but aren't required to.             Airlines may not charge for services             that are required by this rule.             Airlines must make available a             specially-trained Complaints Resolution Official if a dispute             arises. There must be a copy of the DOT rule at every airport.                     It's wise to call the airline again         before your trip to reconfirm any assistance that you have requested.

FREQUENT-FLYER         PROGRAMS           Virtually all major U.S. airlines have a         frequent-flyer plan, and many foreign carriers are starting them. These         programs allow you to earn free trips, upgrades (e.g., from Coach to         First Class) or other awards based on how often you fly on that airline.         In some programs you can earn credit by using specified hotels, rental         car companies, credit cards, etc. It doesn't cost anything to join a         program, and you can enroll in the programs of any number of different         airlines. However, it may not be to your advantage to ""put all your         eggs in one basket"" with one plan by accumulating a high mileage         balance only to find out later that another carrier's program suits your         needs better. Here are some things to look at when selecting a         frequent-flyer program.                       Does the airline fly where you're             likely to want to go?             Are there tie-ins with other carriers,             especially those with international routes? Is some of the airline's             service provided by commuter-carrier ""partners""? In both             cases, can you earn credits and use awards on those other airlines?             How many miles (or trips) are required             for particular awards?             Is there a minimum award per flight             (e.g., you are only flying 200 miles but the airline always awards             at least 500)?             Is there a deadline for using             accumulated miles?             Carefully examine the number and             length of any ""blackout periods"" during which awards             cannot be used. On some carriers, the Thanksgiving blackout may last             a week.             If you are planning a big trip and are             thinking about joining that airline's frequent-flyer program, enroll             before you travel. Airlines usually won't credit mileage that was             flown before you became a member.                     After you join a program, there are other         things that you should know:                       Airlines reserve the right to make             changes to their programs, sometimes on short notice. The number of             miles required for particular awards might be raised, requiring you             to use your old mileage (i.e., your current balance) under the more             restrictive new rules. The airline may cease service on a route that             you were particularly interested in-or it may drop the city you live             in! The carrier may eliminate attractive frequent-flyer tie-ins with             particular airlines or hotel chains.             Cashing in your mileage frequently             will limit your losses in case the carrier changes the rules,             merges, or goes out of business. (Some private companies sell             insurance covering some of these eventualities.) Accumulating a             larger mileage balance will entitle you to bigger awards, however.             Carriers often limit the number of             seats on each flight for which frequent-flyer awards can be used.             You may not be able to get reservations on your first- or             second-choice dates or flights.             Awards can often be issued in the name             of immediate family members. However, if you sell or give an award             to someone not named on the award or the travel document and the             airline finds out, the recipient could have his or her ticket             confiscated, and the carrier may penalize the program member's             account balance.             Ask the airline how mileage is             registered; you will probably have to identify yourself as a program             member when you book your flight or when you check in.             Keep your boarding passes and the             passenger coupon of your ticket until you receive a statement from             the frequent-flyer program reflecting the correct mileage earnings             for that trip. If a problem arises, get the names of the people you             speak with and keep notes of your conversations.                     CONTRACT         TERMS           Throughout this booklet, we have tried to         provide you general information about airline travel. It is important to         realize, however, that each airline has specific rules that make up your         contract of carriage. These rules may differ among carriers. They         include provisions such as check-in deadlines, refund procedures,         responsibility for delayed flights, and many other things.           Domestic Travel           For domestic travel, an airline may         provide all of its contract terms on or with your ticket at the time you         buy it. Many small ""commuter"" carriers use this system. Other         airlines may elect to ""incorporate terms by reference."" This         means that you are not given all the airline's rules with your         ticket-most of them are contained in a separate document which you can         inspect on request. If an airline elects to ""incorporate by         reference"" it must provide conspicuous written notice with each         ticket that: 1) it incorporates terms by reference, and 2) these terms         may include liability limitations, claim-filing deadlines, check-in         deadlines, and certain other key terms. The airline must also:                       Ensure that passengers can receive an             explanation of key terms identified on the ticket from any location             where the carrier's tickets are sold, including travel agencies;             Make available for inspection the full             text of its contract of carriage at each of its own airport and city             ticket offices;             Mail a free copy of the full text of             its contract of carriage upon request.                     There are additional notice requirements         for contract terms that affect your air fare. Airlines must provide a         conspicuous written notice on or with the ticket concerning any         ""incorporated"" contract terms that:                       Restrict refunds;             Impose monetary penalties; or             Permit the airline to raise the price             after you've bought the ticket.                     If an airline incorporates contract terms         by reference and fails to provide the required notice about a particular         rule, the passenger will not be bound by that rule.           International Travel           Not all of the detailed requirements for         disclosing domestic contract terms apply to international travel.         Airlines file ""tariff rules"" with the government for this         transportation. Passengers are generally bound by these rules whether or         not they receive actual notice about them. Every international airline         must keep a copy of its tariff rules at its airport and city ticket         offices. You have a right to examine these rules. The airline agents         must answer your questions about information in the tariff, and they         must help you locate specific tariff rules, if necessary. If the airline         keeps its tariff in a computer rather than on paper, there are         additional disclosure requirements which are similar to those for         domestic contract terms. The most important point to remember, whether         your travel is domestic or international, is that you should not be         afraid to ask questions about a carrier's rules. You have a right to         know the terms of your contract of carriage. It is in your best         interest, as well as that of the airline, for you to ask in advance         about any matters of uncertainty.           TRAVEL         SCAMS           Unlike most products, travel services         usually have to be paid for before they are delivered. This creates         opportunities for disreputable individuals and companies. Some travel         packages turn out to be very different from what was presented or what         the consumer expected. Some don't materialize at all! If you receive an         offer by phone or mail for a free or extremely low-priced vacation trip         to a popular destination (often Hawaii or Florida), there are a few         things you should look for:                       Does the price seem too good to be             true? If so, it probably is.             Are you asked to give your credit card             number over the phone?             Are you pressured to make an immediate             decision?             Is the carrier simply identified as             ""a major airline,"" or does the representative offer a             collection of airlines without being able to say which one you will             be on?             Is the representative unable or             unwilling to give you a street address for the company?             Are you told you can't leave for at             least two months? (The deadline for disputing a credit card charge             is 60 days, and most scam artists know this.)                     If you encounter any of these symptoms,         proceed cautiously. Ask for written information to be sent to you; any         legitimate travel company will be happy to oblige. If they don't have a         brochure, ask for a day or two to think it over; most bona fide deals         that are good today will still be good two days from now. If they say no         to both requests, this probably isn't the trip for you. Some other         advice:                       If you are told that you've won a free             vacation, ask if you have to buy something else in order to get it.             Some packages have promoted free air fare, as long as you buy             expensive hotel arrangements. Others include a free hotel stay, but             no air fare.             If you are seriously considering the             vacation offer and are confident you have established the full price             you will pay, compare the offer to what you might obtain elsewhere.             Frequently, the appeal of free air fare or free accommodations             disguises the fact that the total price is still higher than that of             a regular package tour.             Get a confirmed departure date, in             writing, before you pay anything. Eye skeptically any promises that             an acceptable date will be arranged later. If the package involves             standby or waitlist travel, or a reservation that can only be             provided much later, ask if your payment is refundable if you want             to cancel, and don't pay any money you can't afford to lose.             If the destination is a beach resort,             ask the seller how far the hotel is from the beach. Then ask the             hotel.             Determine the complete cost of the             trip in dollars, including all service charges, taxes, processing             fees, etc.             If you decide to buy the trip after             checking it out, paying by credit card gives you certain legal             rights to pursue a chargeback (credit) if promised services aren't             delivered.

TO         YOUR HEALTH           Flying is a routine activity for millions         of Americans, and raises no health considerations for the great majority         of them. However, there are certain things you can do to ensure that         your flight is as comfortable as possible. Changes in pressure can         temporarily block the Eustachian tube, causing your ears to 'pop' or to         experience a sensation of fullness. To equalize the pressure, swallow         frequently; chewing gum sometimes helps. Yawning is also effective.         Avoid sleeping during descent; you may not swallow often enough to keep         ahead of the pressure change. If yawning or swallowing doesn't help, use         the 'valsalva maneuver':                       Pinch your nostrils shut, then breathe             in a mouthful of air.             Using only your cheek and throat             muscles, force air into the back of your nose as if you were trying             to blow your thumb and finger off your nostrils.             Be very gentle and blow in short             successive attempts. When you hear or feel a pop in your ears, you             have succeeded. Never force air from your lungs or abdomen             (diaphragm); this can create pressures that are too intense.                     Babies are especially troubled by these         pressure changes during descent. Having them feed from a bottle or suck         on a pacifier will often provide relief. Avoid flying if you have         recently had abdominal, eye or oral surgery, including a root canal. The         pressure changes that occur during climb and descent can result in         discomfort. If you have an upper respiratory or sinus infection, you may         also experience discomfort resulting from pressure changes. Postpone         your trip if possible. (Check to see if your fare has cancellation or         change penalties.) A final tip on pressure changes: they cause your feet         to swell. Try not to wear new or tight shoes while flying.           Alcohol and coffee both have a drying         effect on the body. Airliner cabin air is relatively dry to begin with,         and the combination can increase your chances of contracting a         respiratory infection. If you wear contact lenses, the low cabin         humidity and/or consumption of alcohol or coffee can reduce your tear         volume, leading to discomfort if you don't blink often enough. Lens         wearers should clean their lenses thoroughly before the flight, use         lubricating eye drops during the flight, read in intervals, and take the         lenses out if they nap. (This may not apply to extended wear lenses;         consult your practitioner.) If you take prescription medications, bring         enough to last through your trip. Take along a copy of the prescription,         or your doctor's name and telephone number, in case the medication is         lost or stolen. The medicine should be in the original prescription         bottle in order to avoid questions at security or Customs inspections.         Carry it in a pocket or a carry-on bag; don't pack it in a checked bag,         in case the bag is lost.           You can minimize the effects of jet lag         in several ways:                       Get several good nights' sleep before             your trip.             Try to take a flight that arrives at             night, so you can go straight to bed.             Sleep on the plane (although not             during descent).             During the flight do isometric             exercises, eat lightly, and drink little or no alcohol.                     Try to use a rest room in the airport         terminal before departure. On some flights the cabin crew begins         beverage service shortly after the ""Fasten Seat Belts"" sign is         turned off, and the serving cart may block access to the lavatories.           AIRLINE         SAFETY           Air travel is so safe you'll probably         never have to use any of the advice we're about to give you. But if you         ever do need it, this information could save your life. Airline         passengers usually take safety for granted when they board an airplane.         They tune out the crew's pre-flight announcements or reach for a         magazine instead of the cards that show how to open the emergency exit         and what to do if the oxygen mask drops down. Because of this, people         are needlessly hurt or killed in accidents they could have survived.         Every time you board a plane, here are some things you should do:                       Be reasonable about the amount of             carry-on luggage that you bring. FAA rules require airlines to limit             the amount of carry-on baggage, and if you try to carry too much             with you, the crew may insist that you check in some items. (There             is no universal limit; it depends on the aircraft type and the             passenger load.) A bag that is not properly stowed could turn into             an unguided missile in an accident or block the aisles during an             evacuation.             Be careful about what you put into the             storage bins over your seat. Their doors may pop open during an             accident or even a hard landing, spilling their contents. Also,             passengers in aisle seats have been injured by heavy items falling             out of these compartments when people are stowing or retrieving             belongings at the beginning or end of a flight. Please be             considerate of others and put hard, heavy items under the seat in             front of you; save the overhead bins for coats, hats, and small,             soft bags.             As soon as you sit down, fasten and             unfasten your seat belt a couple of times. Watch how it works. There             are several kinds of belts, and in an emergency you don't want to             waste time fumbling with the buckle.             Before take-off, there will be a             briefing about safety procedures, pointing out emergency exits and             explaining seat belts, life vests and oxygen masks. Listen carefully             and if there's anything you don't understand ask the flight             attendants for help.                     The plastic card in the seat pocket in         front of you will review some of the safety information announced by the         flight attendant. Read it. It also tells you about emergency exits and         how to find and use emergency equipment such as oxygen masks. As you're         reading the card look for your closest emergency exit, and count the         number of rows between yourself and this exit. Remember, the closest         exit may be behind you. Have a second escape route planned in case the         nearest exit is blocked. This is important because people sometimes head         for the door they used to board the plane, usually in the front of the         first class cabin. This wastes time and blocks the aisles. Oxygen masks         aren't the same on all planes. Sometimes they drop down in front of you.         On some aircraft, however, you'll have to pull them out of a compartment         in front of your seat. In either case, you must tug the plastic tube         slightly to get the oxygen flowing. If you don't understand the         instructions about how the mask works, ask a flight attendant to explain         it to you. When the plane is safely in the air and has reached its         cruising level, the pilot usually turns off the ""fasten seat         belt"" sign. He or she usually suggests that passengers keep their         belts buckled anyway during the flight in case the plane hits rough air.         Just as seat belts should always be worn in cars, they should always be         fastened in airplanes.           If you are ever in an air accident, you         should remember these things:                       Stay calm.             Listen to the crew members and do what             they say. The cabin crew's most important job is to help you leave             safely.             Before you try to open any emergency             exit yourself, look outside the window. If you see a fire outside             the door, don't open it or the flames may spread into the cabin. Try             to use your alternate escape route.             Remember, smoke rises. So try to stay             down if there's smoke in the cabin. Follow the track of emergency             lights embedded in the floor; they lead to an exit. If you have a             cloth, put it over your nose and mouth.                     After an air accident, the National         Transportation Safety Board always talks to survivors to try to learn         why they were able to make it through safely. They've discovered that,         as a rule, it does help to be prepared. Avoiding serious injury or         surviving an air accident isn't just a matter of luck; it's also a         matter of being informed and thinking ahead. Are you one of those people         who jumps up as soon as the plane lands, gathers up coat, suitcase and         briefcase, and gets ready to sprint while the plane is still moving? If         so, resist the urge. Planes sometimes make sudden stops when they are         taxiing to the airport gate, and passengers have been injured when they         were thrown onto a seat back or the edge of a door to an overhead bin.         Stay in your seat with your belt buckled until the plane comes to a         complete halt and the 'fasten seat belt' sign is turned off. Never smoke         in airplane restrooms. Smoking was banned in all but the designated         smoking sections after an accident killed 116 people in only 4 minutes,         apparently because a careless smoker left a burning cigarette butt in         the trash bin. There is a penalty of up to $2,000 for disabling a         lavatory smoke detector. Also, don't smoke in the aisle. If there is a         sudden bump you could stumble and burn yourself or another passenger.         Lit cigarettes have also flown out of passengers' hands and rolled under         seats.           COMPLAINING           When passengers comment on airline         service, most airlines do listen. They analyze and keep track of the         complaints and compliments they receive and use the information to         determine what the public wants and to identify problem areas that need         special attention. They also try to resolve individual complaints. Like         other businesses, airlines have a lot of discretion in how they respond         to problems. While you do have some rights as a passenger, your demands         for compensation will probably be subject to negotiation and the kind of         action you get depends in large part on the way you go about         complaining. Start with the airline. Before you call or write to DOT or         some other agency for help with an air travel problem, you should give         the airline a chance to resolve it. As a rule, airlines have         trouble-shooters at the airports (they're usually called Customer         Service Representatives) who can take care of many problems on the spot.         They can arrange meals and hotel rooms for stranded passengers, write         checks for denied boarding compensation, arrange luggage repairs and         settle other routine claims or complaints           If you can't resolve the problem at the         airport and want to file a complaint, it's best to call or write the         airline's consumer office at its corporate headquarters. Take notes at         the time the incident occurs and jot down the names of the carrier         employees with whom you dealt. Keep all of your travel documents (ticket         receipts, baggage check stubs, boarding passes, etc.) as well as         receipts for any out-of-pocket expenses that were incurred as a result         of the mishandling. Here are some helpful tips should you choose to         write a letter.                       Type the letter and, if at all             possible, limit it to one page in length.             Include your daytime telephone number             (with area code).             No matter how angry you might be, keep             your letter businesslike in tone and don't exaggerate what happened.             If the complaint sounds very vehement or sarcastic, you might wait a             day and then consider rewriting it.             Describe what happened, and give             dates, cities, and flight numbers or flight times.             Send copies, never the originals, of             tickets and receipts or other documents that can back up your claim.             Include the names of any employees who             were rude or made things worse, as well as anyone who might have             been especially helpful.             Don't clutter up your complaint with             petty gripes that can obscure what you're really angry about.             Let the airline know if you've             suffered any special inconvenience or monetary losses.             Say just what you expect the carrier             to do to make amends. An airline may offer to settle your claim with             a check or some other kind of compensation, possibly free             transportation. You might want a written apology from a rude             employee or reimbursement for some loss you incurred-but the airline             needs to know what you want before it can decide what action to             take.             Be reasonable. If your demands are way             out of line, your letter might earn you a polite apology and a place             in the airline's crank files.                     If you follow these guidelines, the         airlines will probably treat your complaint seriously. Your letter will         help them to determine what caused your problem, as well as to suggest         actions the company can take to keep the same thing from happening to         other people.           Contacting the Department of         Transportation           If you want to put your complaint about         an airline on record with DOT, you can call the Aviation Consumer         Protection Division at (202) 366-2220 to record your complaint. Or         write:           Aviation Consumer Protection Division,         C-75          U.S. Department of Transportation          400 Seventh Street, S.W.          Washington, D.C. 20590           If you write, please be sure to include         your address and a daytime telephone number, with area code. Letters         from consumers help us spot problem areas and trends in the airline         industry. We use our complaint files to document the need for changes in         DOT's consumer protection regulations and, where warranted, as the basis         for enforcement action. In addition, every month we publish a report         with information about the number of complaints we receive about each         airline and what problems people are having. You can write or call us         for a free single copy of this Air Travel Consumer Report, which also         has statistics that the airlines file with us on flight delays,         oversales and mishandled baggage. (Data from recent reports are online         on this home page.) If your complaint is about something you feel is a         safety or security hazard, write to the Federal Aviation Administration:           Assistant Administrator for System         Safety, ASY-100          Federal Aviation Administration          800 Independence Avenue, S.W.          Washington, D.C. 20591           or call: (800) FAA-SURE. After office         hours, if you want to report something that you believe is a serious         safety hazard, call the Aviation Safety Hotline at 1-800-255-1111.           Local consumer help programs           In most communities there are consumer         help groups that try to mediate complaints about businesses, including         airlines and travel agencies.                       Most state governments have a special             office that investigates consumer problems and complaints. Sometimes             it is a separate division in the governor's or state attorney             general's office. Check your telephone book under the state             government's listing.             Many cities and counties have consumer             affairs departments that handle complaints. Often you can register             your complaint and get information over the phone or in person.             A number of newspapers and radio or TV             stations operate ""Hot Lines"" or ""Action Lines""             where individual consumers can get help. Consumer reporters, with             the help of volunteers, try to mediate complaints and may report the             results as a news item. The possible publicity encourages companies             to take fast action on consumer problems when they are referred by             the media. Some Action Lines, however, may not be able to handle             every complaint they receive. They often select the most severe             problems or those that are most representative of the kinds of             complaints they receive.                     Your last resort           If nothing else works, small claims court         might be the best way for you to help yourself. Many cities have these         courts to settle disputes involving relatively small amounts of money         and to reduce the red tape and expense that people generally fear when         they sue someone. An airline can generally be sued in small claims court         in any jurisdiction where it operates flights or does business. You can         usually get the details of how to use the small claims court in your         community by contacting your city or county office of consumer affairs,         or the clerk of the court. As a rule, small claims court costs are low,         you don't need a lawyer, and the procedures are much less formal and         intimidating than they are in most other types of courts.

GX228-93-7550604	"CONTACT: Patricia Viets, NOAA (301) 457-5005  NOAA 02-R303 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 26, 2002  NOAA SATELLITES HELP SAVE FOUR SAILORS FROM ATLANTIC OCEAN Recently, four sailors were rescued from a life raft floating in the Atlantic Ocean 125 miles off the coast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands thanks to environmental satellites in the international Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program, Cospas-Sarsat. Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government detected a distress signal from a 53-foot sailing vessel around 10:00 a.m. on Feb. 24. The vessel had sunk, and the four people onboard were adrift in a life raft when a Navy helicopter from Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, came to their aid. The four people were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to the Naval base. As the vessel sank, its 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was activated. The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard's Rescue Sub-Center (RSC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contacted all agencies in the area requesting air support for a long-range offshore flight, but no aircraft were immediately available. San Juan RSC then contacted Coast Guard District 7 in Miami for additional air support. A Coast Guard C-130 Hercules (CG1712) was airborne in the Windward Pass and was diverted to the scene with about eight hours left of flight time. The aircraft received a strong signal from the 121.5 MHz homer in the EPIRB, and was able to home in on the life raft with the four persons on board. The C-130 deployed a small survival pack to the stranded sailors until they could be rescued. - more -   -2San Juan RSC again contacted Navy Helicopter Squadron VC-8 in Roosevelt Roads and was told that an H-3 Search and Rescue helicopter was now available. After a two hour flight from Puerto Rico, the H-3 arrived on scene and hoisted the four sailors from the life raft. None of the rescued were reported to have any serious injuries. The cause of the sinking is yet unknown, but weather conditions were reported to be less than favorable with winds around 25 knots and four-to-five-foot seas. The crew of the sailing vessel said they are thankful their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment can mean the difference between life and death. ""The Search and Rescue program is truly an international humanitarian program,"" said Ajay Mehta, manager of NOAA's Sarsat program. ""This particular rescue illustrates the international aspect of the program. The vessel was registered with the United Kingdom and three of the people rescued were from Great Britain, the fourth was from Spain. Yet, U.S. search and rescue teams joined together to come to the aid of these individuals."" The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA Satellite and Data Service) represents the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center. NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's Satellite and Data Service in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 35 countries participating in the system. More than 13,000 lives have been saved worldwide since the system became operational in 1982 and more than 4,500 in the United States alone. September of this year marks the 20th anniversary of the first Sarsat rescue. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service operates the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service also operates three data centers, which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and paleoclimatology.

Happy New Year,  Linda Conrad                             [Editor's note: Lisa is a Space Shuttle flight controller in the Mission        Control Center (MCC). Her involvement in the most recent flight (STS-103)        helps to illustrate her responsibilities as a mission is in progress.]         WORKING STS-103 AND OTHER PROJECTS            by Lisa Shore          http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/space/team/shore.html   December 21, 1999 Interviewer: Lori Keith The year 1999 is just about over, but it sure was exciting. I was certified as the first-ever female Ascent Flight Dynamics Officer or Ascent FDO (pronounced Fido, like a dog's name), and in July, worked during mission STS-93. This mission was also unique and historic in the fact that the commander, Eileen Collins, was the first female shuttle commander. A lot of outreach activities surrounded this mission, and I participated in several events with Space Team Online's sister project, Women of NASA (WON).   STS-93 was an interesting flight, besides the historic features, because during ascent there were engine and wiring problems and a nozzle leak. The nozzle leaking propellant resulted in a slight underspeed (15 foot per second). This means that the orbiter ran out of gas before it reached its target velocity which caused the orbit to be seven miles lower on one side than we planned. This happened because in response to the leak, the orbiter increased the propellant flow through the engines causing it to be used up faster than anticipated. This event ended up having no negative impact on the mission, but it was my job to inform everyone in the MCC that we had an underspeed.   All these problems or malfunctions resulted in many actions and investigations. The findings of these investigations caused the delays of the last two flights, STS-103 and STS-99, while inspections of and repairs to the shuttles were made. Crew safety is always the most important issue at NASA. We didn't want to fly again until we were sure that we wouldn't have these problems again.   STO and WON worked together to bring Female Frontiers (FF) to the Internet. FF had several special events planned around the launch of STS-93. One event was an open forum chat. The students asked lots of interesting questions. Then in October, the four FF ambassadors came to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) to meet and have their picture taken with Commander Eileen Collins, Yvonne Cagle and Ellen Ochoa, all astronauts. Much of this was also in conjunction with the Virtual Take Your Daughters to Work Campaign (sponsored by the Ms. Foundation). The four girls were treated to a tour of the Mission Control Center and an overview of JSC. I was their tour guide for part of the day. It was a lot of fun.   My last flight was STS-103, the Hubble Space Telescope Servicing mission, which is still in progress. I worked as the Trajectory officer, which is like the second-in-command FDO. This flight was a bit tricky, as it involved a low-inclination rendezvous with the telescope. The launch targeting was a little different then what we usually do for a space station rendezvous, which is at a higher inclination. The launch window constraints were a bit more challenging, and we had more ascent performance (fuel) on board because the flight is so light. The flight was a great experience. I was beginning to wonder if we were going to be able to get off the ground before time ran out at the end of the year. We had several delays throughout December while the folks at the Cape made sure that everything on the vehicle was ready to fly. When we finally did try to launch on Friday, December 17, the weather didn't cooperate with us. We have rules that say how close thunderstorms can be to the launch pad, how many clouds can be in the area, and how strong the winds can be. If any of these constraints are out of limits then it's not a good day to launch. On Friday night, we had several weather violations. The weather was forecast to be just as bad the next night so we didn't even try to launch on Saturday night. Sunday night was absolutely perfect, and we lifted off right at the beginning of our 42-minute launch window. The launch was flawless, and we inserted into our expected orbit to start our rendezvous with the Hubble. As I write this, we are about to grapple the telescope and begin its repairs.   My next FDO flight is STS-101, currently scheduled for launch in March. This is a Space Station flight, and will be my first ground-up rendezvous as the ascent FDO. Ground-up rendezvous is when something from the ground launches to rendezvous with something already in orbit. I'll begin doing training simulations next year for this mission.   I am still working on the ascent/entry trainer, a software simulation project I mentioned in my bio. Phase 1 is completed and we are finishing up Phase 2, and then we'll begin working on the last phase. This simulation allows us to train in a more expedient manner, saving money and time, by using a single computer workstation, one-on-one, at the trainee's convenience. This saves lots of scheduling conflicts and allows us to tailor the training to meet each person's individual needs.   I have also been taking Russian language classes. It's quite interesting - some parts are easy and some are bizarre. I enjoy the classes and think it's nice to exercise a different part of my brain. It's been about ten weeks now, and I am speaking some broken Russian. The classes are for an hour a day, four days a week.   The first week of November, I worked Inspection Day, which is like an open house for the industry, displaying technology used by NASA. I was a tour guide in the original Mission Control Center. It was really interesting seeing people's reactions to the amount of history that occurred there. Most everyone remembered the first moon landing or was familiar with what happened during Apollo 13, and it all happened right in that room.   I took on a new project - the DAE, or Downrange Abort Evaluator, which is software being developed to replace a tool used in Mission Control and hopefully be used on board the shuttle. I am the project manager for this project. I will tell you more about this in my next journal, so stay tuned . . .                               [Editor's note: I thought you might like to see what it is like to        be spacebound on Christmas day. Below is an STS-103 Mission report.

""Merry Christmas to all of you down there,"" replied Brown. ""And Hubble will be home for Christmas 'cause today we're going to set her free.""   Discovery's astronauts will be doing the gift giving this afternoon as they return the Hubble Space Telescope to orbit, allowing it to continue its astronomical observations. About 1:45 p.m. CST, European Space Agency astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy will use Discovery's robot arm to firmly grasp the telescope.  After a series of commands to disconnect from external power and confirm Hubble is ready for release, Clervoy will gently lift it out of the support structure in Discovery's payload bay where it has rested since he first plucked it from orbit on December 21. The telescope's aperture door will be commanded open, and, at 4:50 p.m., Clervoy will release the upgraded telescope.  Hubble's capabilities were enhanced over the course of three spacewalks lasting a combined total of 24 hours, 33 minutes.  Spacewalking astronauts Steve Smith, John Grunsfeld, Mike Foale and Claude Nicollier installed six new gyroscopes, six Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kits, a new, more efficient computer, and a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor.  Functional checks and tests of the hardware indicate that the new equipment is working properly and will further enhance the Hubble's scientific capabilities.  This afternoon, the spacewalking team, including arm operator Clervoy, will take a break from their duties to discuss the progress of the mission so far in a series of interviews with CNN, the Associated Press and the Fox News Network. That interview is scheduled for 7:12 p.m. today.  Discovery is in an orbit with a high point of 380 miles and a low point of 363 miles with all systems on board performing well.                                     STATUS OF ORBITER PROCESSING - PREPARING FOR STS-99                  Typically this area is devoted to processing of the Columbia Orbiter. At this time Columbia is in California being refurbished, so we will continue to use this area to update you on the mission in focus, in this case STS-99   On Monday, December 13, 1999 Space Shuttle Endeavour rolled out of the Vehicle Assembly Building at 7 a.m., headed toward Launch Pad 39A. Once at the pad, workers will begin routine launch pad validations. All three auxiliary power units will be hot fire tested tomorrow (the 14th). The remainder of the STS-99 prelaunch work schedule is being reviewed due to the recent engine replacement and in order to accommodate STS-103 processing efforts.  (Reference KSC Shuttle Status 12/13/1999)   STS-99 is an 11-day Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Its objective is to obtain the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of the Earth. SRTM consists of a specially modified radar system that will fly onboard the space shuttle during its 11-day mission and gather data that will produce unrivaled 3-D images of the Earth's surface.   The result of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission could be close to 1 trillion measurements of the Earth's topography. Besides contributing to the production of better maps, these measurements could lead to improved water drainage modeling, more realistic flight simulators, better locations for cell phone towers, and enhanced navigation safety.

GX261-49-4804754	"U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration  FAA Headquarters Aviation Education Division  FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION CURRICULUM GUIDE FOR AVIATION MAGNET SCHOOLS PROGRAMS  Prepared by Dr. Mervin K. Strickler, Jr. AHT-100-1-94   ABOUT THE AUTHOR  Dr. Mervin K. Strickler, Jr., a native of Pennsylvania, graduated from Clarion State University. In 1951 he received his doctorate from Stanford University with specialization in aviation higher education. During his long and distinguished career he served as Director, USAF-Civil Air Patrol Aviation Education from 1951 to 1960, and as Director of the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Education Program from 1960 to 1979. From 1973 to 1979, he also worked with the Commonwealth of Independent States (then Soviet Union) as the FAA's representative for scientific and technical aviation education and training for all facets of civil aviation. He continues today as an international consultant on aviation education matters to industry, government, and all levels of education. Dr. Strickler's many publications and papers are included in libraries around the world. He is frequently called upon to speak at major aviation events and is well known nationally and internationally for his expertise in aviation education.   PREFACE The Federal Aviation Administration's current interests, activities, projects and programs in aviation education represent and stem from a continuation and expansion of programs and similar initiatives of its predecessor organizations. Present programs are a result of the most recent FAA Administrator's Task Force Report on Aviation Education completed in 1990. The Report identified over fifty aviation education initiatives as appropriate to support the agency's objectives. As of mid-1993, FAA's Aviation Education Division programs use the top ten initiatives of the Task Force Report. This initial Phase I of the Report focuses on FAA's efforts to increase emphasis on the growing needs of a diverse society and work force. FAA Aviation Education Division programs fall into four categories: information distribution educational relations youth and public education partnerships with government, industry and education  Our aviation education activities form a nucleus to help meet current Congressional mandates and help sustain the agency's aviation education mission in support of future requirements of the National Aviation System (NAS). FAA is a part of a United States government-wide effort to assure appropriate federal responses to and support for improving the quality of education in the nation. This organization is known as the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering and Technology - Committee on Education and Human Resources (FCCSET-CEHR). This Aviation Magnet School Guide represents the kind of effort recommended by the FCCSET-CEHR. FAA's long experience in aviation education proves that programs such as those described in this Guide, enhance learning and will ultimately contribute to a greater awareness of the role of air transportation as well as contribute significantly to improving education in the nation's schools. It is realized that programs outlined in this publication will help attract and motivate a diverse population of young men and women to qualify for rewarding careers that will help in the design and operation of a safe and efficient future National Aviation System (NAS). Phillip S. Woodruff, Division Manager Aviation Education Division   ""While the concept of the magnet school is not a new one, the application of that concept has been expanded and modified over the years as student and societal needs have changed. The first magnet school, Boston Latin, was actually founded in the 17th Century in 1635. Originally designated to meet the needs of a small intellectual elite, magnet schools now serve a twin focus: the improvement of educational quality while increasing racial integration. In addition, these schools often provide a setting for teacher-generated reform initiatives."" From Magnet Schools Recent Developments and PerspectivesEdited by Nolan Estes, Daniel U. Levine, Donald R. Waldrip. ,  ""In a world that is highly and increasingly competitive, all of our children, including our best and our brightest are at risk. Meeting our national education goals requires that the performance of our highest achievers be boosted to match or exceed the performance levels of the best students anywhere in the world. The performance of our lowest achievers must also be substantially increased far beyond their current performance. What our best students can now achieve, our average students must be able to achieve by the turn of the century. We must work to ensure that a significant number of students from all races and ethnic groups, both male and female, and students from all income levels are among our best performers. I believe that our aerospace magnets are capable of responding to the needs and aspirations of all of these students.""

One of the first modern era magnet schools developed using a thematic approach featuring aviation, space and transportation is described in the FAA publication entitled: A Model Aerospace Curriculum - August Martin High School. In many respects, this publication is designed to build on and replace the earlier developed August Martin High School curriculum guide. However, the lessons learned by community leaders, parents, educators, board of education members, representatives of labor unions, and local, state and federal officials who planned and carried out the August Martin program have relevance for anyone interested in magnet school planning today. The FAA continues its long record of interest in and support for aviation education at all levels of education. In terms of aviation magnet schools the FAA, under the leadership of Mr. Phillip Woodruff, has planned and conducted the first two national level aviation magnet school conferences ever held in the United States. The first was held in cooperation with the Little Rock, Arkansas School District in November of 1991 and the second was held in Phoenix, Arizona in cooperation with the Phoenix Unified School District in November, 1992. The third such conference will be held in Louisville, Kentucky in cooperation with the Shawnee School District in November of 1993. A number of the ideas, examples of programs and aviation education suggestions included in this publication came from those who attended the 1991 and 1992 aviation magnet school national conferences. This publication is designed to provide: - a brief history of the role of aviation in motivating young people to learn. - examples of aviation magnet activities, programs, projects and school curriculums. - documentation of the benefits of aviation education for students. - examples of what one person can do to facilitate aviation magnet education activities, projects, programs, curriculums. - curricular and program models for use, adaptation or modification. - identification of resources for planning a program of aviation education. - information about and examples of curricula to prepare for the   2 many career opportunities in aviation and transportation. - guidelines and information for FAA Aviation Education Counselors. According to the best available information, the longest continuously operating aviation thematic high school in the United States is the Aviation High School in New York City. It started operation in 1936. The program qualifies students for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificated Airframe (A) and Powerplant (P) Maintenance Technician ratings in accordance with rules, policies, procedures and curriculum prescribed by Federal Aviation Administration Regulation (FAR-Part 147). Details of this historic program are described in this publication. Many pre-flight aeronautics academic programs were taught in thousands of high schools during World War II in order to motivate more young people to join the military forces and become pilots or other air crew members. After the war most high schools dropped these programs. Following World War II an innovative educator started a model high school aeronautics program that served to motivate many other teachers and schools. This Weber County High School program in Ogden, Utah was designed and taught by John V. Sorenson from 1949 to 1954. More recently programs such as Wright Flight, Opportunity Skyway, Star Base I and the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) programs have emerged as examples of what can be done with mostly volunteer community resources. The actual construction and test flight of an aircraft is one example of such magnet projects. Perhaps most important, there appears to be a growing body of literature on the effectiveness of magnet or thematic education programs. Illustrative examples of such data are included in this publication. The FAA has materials for and interests in aviation education from kindergarten through elementary, middle, high school and two and four year college programs. Questions answered in this publication include: - What is Aerospace Education? - What historic examples exist to illustrate aviation, space, transportation related scientific, technical and operational means to achieve educational ends? - What evidence exists to justify aviation education, aerospace or related school and college educational programs as being educationally effective? - Where were there or are there models of programs that work? - What is the role of career education in aerospace education programs?   3 - What are some of the sources of information, assistance, guidance, possible funding, professional help and community support? - Why should any school system plan to operate an aviation or aerospace magnet educational program? - What evaluation techniques should be used in assessing an aerospace education program? It should be noted that not all aviation or aerospace education magnet programs in the United States are listed in this publication. Examples described are illustrative of the variety of magnet projects that are possible. The movement toward increasing numbers of magnet schools, programs, activities and projects is such that there are already hundreds of magnet programs in the United States. It appears there are more being planned on a regular basis. Not all of these, of course, use an aviation or aerospace theme. But the educational philosophy underlying all magnet programs, regardless of theme, is simple and direct: well-planned magnet programs provide excellence in education at all levels. An indication of the growth of magnet schools may be seen in the preliminary results of the first survey of aviation or aerospace-oriented secondary schools as reported in Section XV. The list of these twenty-seven schools is provided. As of May, 1993 the first phase of a national survey of all magnet schools, elementary and secondary, regardless of theme or central motif, was published by the organization, Magnet Schools of America. Dr. Ronald P. Simpson, President of Magnet Schools of America and Director of Student Admissions, Kansas City, Missouri Magnet School programs, planned and directed this survey. Dr. Simpson recently stated: ""We have verified 1,701 schools throughout the country for their Magnet or ThemeBased presentation of curriculum and city-wide enrollment opportunities."" Magnet schools are growing in popularity and numbers. Magnet programs demonstrate the literal meaning of the term magnet; that is, they attract. But a caution is in order because magnets can repel if they are not planned or positioned to attract.   1 SECTION II - DEFINING MAGNET SCHOOLS Innovative educators have always used attractive methods to help students learn. As Dr. Nolan Estes has pointed out, 1635 marks the earliest identified magnet school - Boston Latin. Using aviation as a central theme to facilitate learning only five years after the Wright Brothers pioneered the discovery of powered, controlled flight in 1903 a creative physics teacher, H. LaVonne Twining, in 1908, used aeronautical science and mathematics examples in his classes. In the early decades of this century many school systems designed technical or vocational trade schools designed to prepare high school students for various technical trades. Today area vocational-technical schools provide similar career training opportunities. But relatively few, compared to the entire nation-wide public education system, make use of aviation or aerospace as a central theme. However, there are more and more school systems looking at the role of aviation, space, transportation as thematic approaches to education. Magnet themes for elementary and secondary education are growing at a rapid rate. Many specialized topics provide core themes for a magnet approach to education. The U.S. Department of Education in a 1991 publication entitled: Magnet Schools: Promoting Equal Opportunity & Quality Education lists seventy-one ""Magnet Curricular Themes and Learning Environments Supported Under the Magnet Schools Assistance Program."" Magnet school programs have evolved in recent years as a result of a number of initiatives. In many instances a creative teacher has used his or her specialized knowledge to introduce a core theme in traditional subjects to make the teaching more interesting and effective. This has been happening more and more in classes in elementary and secondary schools by teachers who have learned the value of aerospace in enhancing learning in all traditional subjects or disciplines. Courts have mandated and approved magnet programs and schools to help remove racial segregation and ethnic isolation in some school districts. The federal government has annually awarded several hundred million dollars to help school districts achieve voluntary desegregation plans and greater racial and ethnic balance in formerly segregated schools. A detailed description of the role of magnet education programs as viewed by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, as of May, 1991, is shown in the following material. INTRODUCTION Magnet schools are commanding increased interest and attention. From a few programs in major urban areas a decade ago, there are now more than a thousand magnet schools in large, medium and small school districts across the nation. While varying in scope, design, and outcome, magnet school programs share important objectives: promotion of educational excellence, equality of educational opportunity, and student and parental choice. Although no single method of organizing   2 school systems will resolve all education problems or is suitable for all students, magnet schools have gained importance in efforts aimed at preventing, eliminating, or reducing racial isolation in our elementary and secondary schools. MAGNET SCHOOL CONCEPT While adhering to state standards for the core curriculum required for graduation, magnet schools offer specialized and innovative instructional approaches to attract students of different racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. They include educational programs and services that are either the focus of an entire school (dedicated magnets) or are offered as part of a school's standard curriculum (mini-magnets). With respect to enrollment policy, a magnet school can be opened to all students in a school system (e.g., city-wide magnet) or restricted by attendance areas. A variety of educational programs and methods are used in magnet schools, in conjunction with the core curriculum. Some magnets focus on a special learning environment, such as ""open education,"" accelerated learning, or individualized continuous progress to meet special or unique needs of students. Most magnet schools emphasize core academic subjects but offer a distinctive themebased curriculum that attracts students with specific interests. The overriding premise of magnet schools is that no single curriculum or instructional method is definitive for all students; therefore, parents and students may benefit from a range of choices in meeting their diverse education needs. Students in a magnet school can pursue individual interests, while completing core curriculum requirements for graduation. USE OF MAGNET SCHOOLS The establishment of magnet schools introduced a voluntary component to desegregation plans that had previously relied exclusively on compulsory strategies, such as busing students across attendance zones and pairing of schools. Federal courts began to approve desegregation plans that relied on, or incorporated, the use of magnet schools to achieve greater racial balance in formerly segregated school systems. State and local school administrators joined in the effort to attract students to magnet schools as an alternative to mandatory student assignment. In addition, some school systems, not under a legal obligation to desegregate, elected to establish magnet schools to counteract student racial isolation resulting from segregated housing patterns or other demographic factors. Interest in magnet schools also has paralleled the recent national reexamination of public education and subsequent local school reform activities. These efforts have concentrated on the following objectives: attaining educational excellence, improving the quality of instruction in core academic subjects, offering educational choice and diversity, renewing participation of parents in education decisions and restoring confidence in public schools. DIVERSITY OF MAGNET SCHOOL PROGRAMS Since magnet schools are part of the dynamic educational process, they are subject to constant change. Today, magnet schools feature diverse curricula, instructional approaches, and services that allow parents and students in communities with magnet programs to select a school that meets their education goals and special needs.   3  The examples of magnet school programs described below are broadly representative of those programs that have been or are now operating in many school districts throughout the United States. However, some of the examples such as the child-care program described under the Extended Day program, would not meet the requirements for funding under the federal assistance program for magnet schools described below. MAGNET SCHOOL PROGRAMS - Elementary Schools Basic Science and Technology In this program, the focus is on science and technology education. While basic skills are emphasized, students are exposed to scientific themes in all their academic and enrichment areas. The facilities at the school include aquariums, a planetarium,greenhouse, satellite dish, and computer communications capabilities. After-school activities and summer programs reinforce students' interest in science. There is substantial participation by the higher education and business communities in the program. Classical/Traditional Academy This highly structured program is offered in an environment that stresses disciplined behavior, dress codes, and punctuality. The program concentrates on excellence in reading and writing, along with special emphasis on mathematics and science. There is rigorous teaching of spelling, listening, and studying skills. The classics in literature are emphasized at all grade levels. Communication Arts The program uses high technology equipment as a vehicle for improving reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. Students use a television studio for long-range class projects involving script writing and telephone (sic) shows that are broadcast throughout the school. Multi-media centers are located in each classroom. Students receive instruction in using the computer in communication arts skills. Environment Center Ecology is taught as part of the science, health, safety, and social studies classes, in coordination with art, reading, and language arts. An environmental laboratory and greenhouse support the curriculum by providing activities for students to address problems of man and his environment. Extended Day An assortment of early morning and after-school enrichment activities are offered to children of working parents as an alternative to non-educational child care. In this program, the participating schools are located near high employment areas or along major traffic routes. The program offers   4 computer labs and homework centers, activities in arts and crafts, recreation, music, dance, sewing, and cooking. French Foreign Language Immersion Students start this program in kindergarten and by third grade can acquire a fluency in French comparable to native speaking children of the same age. The program extends to grade 6. At the kindergarten and first grade levels, classes are taught entirely in French. English accounts for 25 percent of instruction time ingrades 2 and 3. By grades 4 to 6, instruction is equally divided between French and English, with certain subject areas designated for each language. High technology The computer is an integral part of the entire instructional program. In terms of the core curriculum, computer assisted instruction is available in reading, math, and creative writing. This magnet program also provides individualized computer science instruction, including keyboard skills and programming. International Studies This program is intended to increase students' awareness of other parts of the world while concurrently developing their basic reading, writing, and math skills. Students are introduced to history, geography, economics, and the culture of other countries through a number of creative methods. These methods include learning folk tales and stories; studying holidays of various countries; using the metric system; and attending lectures by foreign visitors. An important objective of the program is to make students aware of the many international careers that will be opened in the next century. Research and Study Skills Center Students undertake individual research projects in the humanities, arts, and sciences in a program that emphasizes self-motivation and study discipline. In the process, students use word processors, conduct computer searches, and use the facilities of libraries, colleges, and museums. Students use various media including film, videotape, and photography when presenting the results of their research projects. Science Magnet The program is a ""hands-on"" approach to learning science that emphasizes reasoning, investigation, and the scientific method. Students produce science newsletters to enhance reading and writing skills. Career education activities are incorporated to make students aware of the range of job choices in the science field.   5 Intermediate Schools Future Technologies School The premise of this program is that computers, robots, laser beams, and satellite dishes will be in the home and work place when students become adults. Accordingly, the school introduces these technologies to prepare students for the future. Medical The program is for students who are considering medicine and related sciences. Students visit community health agencies and interrelate with a variety of health professionals. An expanded school day includes a club period allowing students to explore special interest areas in the medical profession. Telecommunications and Computer Technology In this magnet program, instruction in the regular core curriculum is enhanced through the resources of the cable television network (satellite transmissions) along with an expanded computer capability. Videocassette materials are also used extensively. In addition to instructional use of these technologies, students receive a three-year sequential course in computer technology. High Schools Aerodynamics Academy Students with an interest and aptitude in aviation learn to fly in a general aviation/flight training program. Specialized courses supplement the core curriculum and include navigation, meteorology, theory of flight, aircraft design, hydraulic systems, and assembly of wood and metal structures. Foreign Language Academy This program offers foreign languages beyond the traditional choices. Students may enroll in Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese Chinese, Hebrew, Latin, German, Russian, or English as a second language. Two language laboratories, closed circuit and cable television, a language videotaping center, club activities, and field trips complement the learning of the language and the culture. Health Care This health/science magnet emphasizes broad-based preparation for future health-related careers. The school has close curricular links with a nearby medical college. Students have opportunities to work in hospitals and health centers as part of their studies. The first year is the most structured, with all students taking common core subjects. The skilled training later received makes employment possible in a health-related field for graduates not electing further education.   6 Petrochemical Careers Institute Students work with petrochemical engineers and refinery technicians. A working model of a refinery is used in the classroom and is followed with hands-on work experience. Students are offered chemical laboratory technology, instrumentation/process operations, and mechanical technology. The program satisfies core curriculum requirements and provides college preparation as well as the kind of job experience that leads to direct employment. School of Communications This magnet offers hands-on experience in television, radio, and the print media. The state-required core curriculum is supplemented by intensive instruction in the technical side of media production, script writing, and live broadcasting. University High School This four-year program provides intense, comprehensive preparation for college. Students are expected to master the major academic competencies identified by the College Board as required for success in postsecondary education. Students select a major, and a related internship is required. The program emphasizes student participation in small tutorial groups and seminars, some conducted by visiting college professors. Students explore various aspects of college life and receive training in key study and communication skills in preparation for college level work and career decisions. There are opportunities for students to receive college credit for course work, including advanced placement courses. Visual and Performing Arts This program is designed for the artistically talented. Students participate and, eventually, major in one of the following areas: visual arts (painting, sculpture, graphic arts, architecture), dance (ballet, tap, modern, jazz), music (instrumental and vocal),theatre (performing, technical, management, criticism) or television/radio production (performance and technical). State-of-the-art technology and facilities support the program, which includes a complete television and recording studio, art gallery, and a computer/laboratory for graphic art and advertising. Students study with professional artists, dancers, musicians, directors, and radio/television personalities. The program provides a strong academic background in all core subjects and is designed to prepare students for further professional study and career options in the arts. STATE MAGNET PROGRAMS Besides individual school districts, several states have established magnet schools. For example, one state supports four regional magnet high schools for gifted students and students who are dissatisfied with programs offered in their local school systems. At least three states are now operating public residential high schools for students with high abilities in mathematics, science, and the arts.   7 In one such school, students can choose from structured courses, such as microbiology and astrophysics, or they can design their own one-on-one tutorials. Students also are encouraged to work with researchers at nearby universities and high technology firms. This school also has set up programs to improve statewide science-mathematics teaching, offering its faculty members as consultants to other public schools. EFFECTIVENESS OF MAGNET SCHOOLS There have been few comprehensive evaluations of the effectiveness of magnet schools. The majority of the research conducted has focused on general descriptions of individual magnet schools and comparisons of selected magnet programs. However, more empirical and refined research is being done to assess the operation and results of magnet schools. The Department of Education has funded two studies to assess the effects of magnet programs on school desegregation. These studies are notable since they are among the few which have looked at magnet schools on a national basis. The first study1 found that magnet schools have a positive effect on district-wide desegregation under certain conditions. These include a strong policy commitment on the part of local schoolofficials to the magnet school concept and to effective implementation of a desegregation program. School districts showing the most desegregation progress used magnets along with other desegregation techniques. The research findings also reported that magnet schools helped reduce community conflict concerning desegregation in over half of the school districts studied. In other districts, magnet schools worked towards anticipating and preventing conflict. The second study2 also determined the significant contributions magnet programs can make in promoting school desegregation. The study compared comprehensive voluntary desegregation plans that relied primarily on magnet schools (most of the plans also contained some mandatory student reassignment) with mandatory desegregation plans (each of these plans also contained some magnet schools). The study found that the voluntary plans relying heavily on magnet schools desegregated school districts more effectively than mandatory plans over the long term. Furthermore, the reduction in student racial isolation tended to continue each year after the initial implementation of the magnet program. Some smaller studies have focused on the relationship among students in magnet schools. The findings support the concept that magnet programs with high education quality tend to promote positive interracial interaction and understanding. Also, students in magnet schools tend to develop interracial friendships. EDUCATION-RELATED ACCOMPLISHMENTS Magnet programs offer the prospect of significant improvements and accomplishments related to the education process.   8 Quality Education - A principal conclusion of one national study is that magnet schools provide high quality education. One-third of the magnet schools in the study were rated highly on all of the following: instruction, curriculum, student-teacher interaction, student learning opportunities, and use of resources. Most of the other magnet schools in the sample were rated highly on some of these factors. These achievements with regard to the quality of the educational experience were unrelated to a magnet school's size, program theme, or organization (dedicated or mini-magnet). Nor did high quality education require selective admission of students. (The magnet schools were serving average as well as high-ability students.) This study identified three building-level factors to be consistently related to high-quality education: an innovative principal who exerts strong leadership in motivating staff and students and in developing curriculum; high coherence of the magnet theme, curriculum, teaching methods, and staff capabilities, resulting in a strong program identity and some flexibility with respect to application of the district's administrative rules and procedures. Student Achievement - Improvement of reading and math test scores also has been linked with magnet schools. In one of the national studies, 80 percent of the magnet schools reported test scores above their district averages. More than 40 percent of these schools produced average test scores that were at least 10 points higher than their district averages. In 20 percent of the magnet schools tested, scores were more than 30 points higher than district averages. A number of studies not only show improvement in test scores but also reflect a reduction in the number of students scoring below grade level for minority as well as non-minority students. Several studies attribute these improvements to the use of the special curriculum and additional resources provided by magnet schools. School Attendance and Discipline - Higher average daily attendance rates have been reported for magnet schools. Student dropout, suspension, and school transfer rates also have been reported lower than district averages in comparable non-magnet schools. One school district reported a 36 percent reduction in school vandalism since the introduction of its magnet program. Some data are indicating a reduction in violence in magnet schools, including magnet schools specifically designed to attract delinquent or disruptive students. The research also relates these results to the voluntary enrollment and unique characteristics of magnet schools. Student Satisfaction - One study reported that when students attend magnet schools for at least a three-year period, there is an increase in their self-esteem and in overall school satisfaction relative to students who attend non-magnet schools. Studies also are reporting significant increases in the number of students in magnet schools who participate in extracurricular activities, as compared with students who attend non-magnet schools. Parent Participation - In the few studies where this has been considered, the participation of parents of magnet school students was higher than for parents of other students. Teacher Expectations and Performance - The most recent research reports that teacher expectations of students in magnet schools are not affected by the student's race. This is in contrast with previous attitudinal studies that indicated teachers expected less of minority students. There is   9 some evidence that magnet schools can be a means for renewing teacher interests and motivation through establishment of a common academic goal and interdisciplinary curriculum planning. Also there is evidence of greater job satisfaction on the part of magnet school teachers. Educational Diversity and Choice - Magnet school programs are successful in offering educational diversity and choice. Research has related these factors to achievement of educational excellence. Also, many case studies of magnet schools show that providing diversity and choice accounts, in large part, for the attraction of magnet schools for students and parents. Perceptions of Public Schools - Many magnet schools are having a positive effect in reducing enrollment decline in their school districts. In some cases, magnet schools have not only stemmed the flow of students to private schools but also have succeeded in attracting large numbers of students back to the public school system. In one reported school system with a long history of racial turmoil, 4,000 students returned to the public schools during a three-year period, which corresponded to the district's institution of a magnet school program. The existence of magnet schools also may challenge other schools to improve the quality of their instructional programs, which appears to be related to competition among schools for students. Magnet schools have slightly higher average costs per pupil than non-magnet schools according to one reported research study. Magnet schools with specific single themes (e.g., arts or science) had lower costs than combination magnets with two or more themes. Costs declined for magnet schools at all levels after the start-up years. The items on which magnet schools continued to spend more money than non-magnet schools were teacher salaries (teachers in magnet schools tend to have more years of experience) and student transportation. Also, this study concluded that school districts that made the commitment to cover the extra costs benefitted by attaining increased quality education and student desegregation. COMMUNITY-RELATED ACCOMPLISHMENTS Community Confidence - Effective magnet schools can help increase community confidence in public education. In many instances where the magnet program has carried out its objectives, public support for the school district has increased substantially. Citizen Participation - Some case studies of magnet schools indicate that their establishment has resulted in larger citizen participation in the education process. This support varies but often includes participation in program design or curriculum, development and volunteer work at the school sites (e.g., teacher aides). Partnership Programs - Through magnet school programs, the private sector is encouraged to participate in public education in new ways. Partnerships have been formed between magnet schools and business and industry, labor unions, colleges and universities, and creative arts groups. Some Adopt-A-School programs pair individual schools with these organizations. In turn, these organizations assist in the development of curricula and the provision of resources (including the loan of facilities, equipment, and personnel) for learning. In one school district, there are more than 40 such partnerships. In another district, businesses are paired with specific magnet schools to   10 provide a hands-on approach to academic programs, while labor organizations have developed vocational, technical, and trade programs. FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR MAGNET SCHOOLS The Magnet Schools Assistance Program (MSAP) provides federal financial assistance to plan, establish, and operate magnet schools that offer a special curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds. A local education agency (LEA) is eligible to receive assistance under MSAP if it is implementing a desegregation plan required under a court order or state-agency order or implementing a desegregation plan approved by or required by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The MSAP program is administered by the Department of Education's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. Grants to school districts are authorized to eliminate, reduce, or prevent minority group isolation in elementary and secondary schools and to strengthen academic and vocational education skills in students attending magnet schools. Funds may be used for planning, promotion activities, teacher salaries and the acquisition of books, materials, and equipment (including computers). Funds may not be used for activities that do not augment academic improvement. In addition to programmatic selection criteria, under the law, special consideration is given to the recentness of the implementation of an applicant's desegregation plan, proportion of minority children involved in the plan, cost or difficulty of carrying out the plan and extent to which the purposes of MSAP including the prevention, elimination, or reduction of racial isolation - are attainable. Under the 1988 reauthorizing legislation, special consideration must also be given to projects that involve collaboration withcolleges and universities, community organizations, the appropriate state education agency, or other private organizations. Grants under MSAP are awarded on a competitive basis. School districts receive one-year awards and may apply for second-year continuation grants. These are approved if the school district is making satisfactory progress toward achieving the purposes of the program. An eligible district may receive no more than $4 million in any one fiscal year. The MSAP defines ""special curriculum"" as a course of study offered to students in the magnet school program that embraces a subject matter or teaching methodology that is not generally offered to students of the same age or grade level in the same LEA. The special curricular themes and learning environments that MSAP grants have made possible for children attending magnet schools are listed below. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Desegregation Plan Eligibility - An applicant must have an approved desegregation plan containing a magnet school component. This plan may also be approved or required by OCR. In approving a magnet school component, OCR must determine that this magnet school component has been or will be effective in reducing, preventing, or eliminating minority group isolation. Civil Rights Assurances - An applicant must provide assurances that it will not engage in discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, handicap, or sex in the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees, in the mandatory assignment of students to schools or courses of instruction, and in extracurricular student activities. OCR must determine whether these assurances will be met. This determination is based on a review of the applicant's record of compliance with the appropriate federal nondiscrimination laws. Information from other federal, state, or local civil rights agencies is considered along with information gathered by OCR.   13 Information about MSAP can be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary 1and Secondary Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202.  1  Blank, R.A., Dentler, R.A., Baltzell, D.C., and Chabotar, K.

BUSEY, ADMINISTRATOR The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a rich history of dedication and commitment to aviation education. The Congress has recognized this historic leadership role by requiring a civil aviation information distribution program within each FAA region to support the agency's aviation education program. Aviation education is an integral element of the agency's mission and is essential to carrying out its responsibilities of promoting aviation and flight safety. Therefore, it will be the policy of the FAA to support aviation education and to expand its scope under the theme of ""aviation awareness"" with new, broader program initiatives. This expanded effort will focus on the general public, through partnerships with the private sector, states, and communities; pilots, mechanics, and other airmen; colleges and universities; as well as public and private schools at all levels. Our goal is to provide increased awareness of civil aviation to promote intelligent, informed decisions about aviation by citizens and community leaders. We aim to promote an aviation-aware society, which understands and respects the economic importance of aviation at the national and community levels. A key focus during my administration is to stimulate interest in aviation careers among America's young people, in order to provide a steady flow of skilled professionals, especially women and minorities. This will ensure America's continuing preeminence in world aviation. EXCERPTS OF REMARKS BY FANNY RIVERA, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, WESTERN REGION, FAA AT SECOND ANNUAL AVIATION MAGNET SCHOOL CONFERENCE PHOENIX, ARIZONA, NOVEMBER 20, 1992 FAA COMMITMENT TO AVIATION EDUCATION The FAA has a rich history of dedication and commitment to aviation education. Our commitment is based on the knowledge that our future depends on America's youth. If the United States is to maintain its preeminence as the world leader in aviation, we must strive to provide the best possible educational opportunities for our children. DIVERSITY We must recognize that our youth is diverse and take advantage of their knowledge, skills and experiences.   2  We must draw upon people from all cultures and backgrounds to build and maintain our nation's airplanes, design and develop our electronic aids to navigation or perform the myriad of other jobs necessary to operate an ever more technical and complex airspace system. It is imperative that we as an agency recognize this and make every effort to ensure the availability of a well qualified, highly trained and motivated work force, ready to meet the demands of tomorrow's aviation industry. ACTION Our commitment to our diverse youth does not solely equate to words. For it to truly have meaning, it must equate to actions. FAA sponsorship of this conference demonstrates our resolve to promote aviation in the classroom. It reinforces our commitment to foster the development of quality high school aviation programs. The interdisciplinary, thematic approach, one that uses aviation as the key which binds together mathematics, science, language arts, social studies, history and art - can help forge new ways to motivate students to gain the most from their education. MISSIONS The FAA has a simple but vital mission: to ensure the safe and efficient use of our nation's airspace. The same is true of our aviation education mission: to promote the understanding of aviation and the vital role it plays in our nation's social and economic development. These missions together will pave the way to helping our nation's youth chart a clear path toward career success. I invite educators to become partners with us, to take advantage of the resources we have to offer, and together we can build a work force of the future and ensure that our nation will remain on the cutting edge of aviation technology. FAA AVIATION EDUCATION PROGRAM POLICY STATEMENT FROM AVIATION EDUCATION RESOURCE CENTERS PUBLICATION BY PHILLIP S. WOODRUFF, DIRECTOR OF AVIATION EDUCATION The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a rich history of dedication and commitment to aviation education. The Congress has recognized this historic leadership role by requiring a civil aviation information distribution program within each FAA region to support the agency's aviation education program.   3 Aviation education is an integral element of the agency's mission and is essential to carrying out its responsibilities of promoting aviation and flight safety. The agency is dedicated to the development and implementation of aviation education programs which provide general education for all citizens and information on aviation careers for America's young people with a special emphasis on women and minority youth. WHY FAA IS INTERESTED IN AVIATION MAGNET SCHOOLS The FAA is engaged in a comprehensive program to modernize the Nation's air transportation system to meet the challenge of aviation growth in the coming decades. The modernization program takes advantage of current technological advances to increase the capacity of the Nation's air transportation system while reducing relative costs to the Nation's taxpayers. The FAA recognizes the increasing complexity of technical and managerial skills that will be needed to accommodate the technological advances in systems being planned and implemented throughout the aviation industry. FAA further recognizes that our educational system will play a critical role in preparing persons for careers in this advanced technological environment. For these reasons, FAA supports the development of aviation magnet secondary schools.* *From The Federal Register, Volume 57, No. 150, Tuesday, August 4, 1992   1 SECTION IV - AEROSPACE MAGNET SCHOOLS PAST - PRESENT - FUTURE The following material is adapted from the Background Paper prepared for the Keynote Address at the 1st Annual National Leadership Institute on Aerospace Magnet Schools sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Little Rock, Arkansas District School System, November, 1991 by Dr. Mervin K. Strickler, Jr. WHAT IS AEROSPACE EDUCATION? Before defining aerospace education, one needs to assure what is meant by education. The definition I prefer to use in defining education is simple to state but challenging to attain. Simply put, for purposes of this paper, the definition of education is that it is synonymous with behavior change. In short, one defines education by inference. If a student enters a purported educational program - at any level of development - and leaves the program, course, project or experience and thinks, believes and behaves the same afterward as before, then no education has taken place. On a positive note, society defines the acceptable behaviors one expects from schooling, education. In our pluralistic society with our nation's historic and cherished tradition of local autonomy in education not all communities will agree with all of the manifest behaviors that are desired. However, we do generally have a national consensus as to the behaviors or performance one expects from a citizen who is educated - or who is supposed to be. Before discussing education further at this point one needs to define aerospace. Aerospace may be defined both as an activity and as an environment. As a field of activity, aerospace includes astronautics and aeronautics. As an environment, aerospace includes that total expanse extending upward and outward from the earth's surface and through the atmosphere and to space beyond. In understanding the scope of aerospace, especially in terms of how it relates to education, one needs to realize there are ten major categories within aerospace. These categories are: I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. IX. X. The Environment The Basic Sciences in Aerospace Man in Flight People & Events in Aerospace Development Aerospace Vehicles Aviation & Space Operations The Art and Techniques of Flight VIII. Communications & Control Manufacturing & Facilities Aerospace & Society  A more detailed breakdown of each of these categories is shown below. Study of these categories readily shows the relationships between all elements that go to make up aerospace and the many disciplines ranging from A to Z, Art to Zoology, Alpha to Omega. Anyone planning a total curriculum or just small elements of a subject should first consult this detailed, inclusive outline.   2  I. THE ENVIRONMENT - The earth must be considered the basic reference point for all flight with its mantle of atmosphere thinning into the vacuum of endless space as the realm of aerospace flight. A. Earth - Our planet's basic characteristics form our standards of time, distance and magnitude; and determine the perimeters of our understanding of the universe. 1. Basic characteristics 2. Reference system 3. Earth-Moon relationship B. Aerospace - The aerospace realm is divided and subdivided into many regions depending upon a particular disciplinary viewpoint. Flight through the atmosphere and in space are quite distinct with a merging of the two in a zone that has some of the environmental characteristics of both. 1. Atmosphere (0 - 70,000 ft.) a. Structure b. Composition c. Phenomena 2. Transition zone (70,000 ft. - 50 miles) 3. Space (beyond 50 miles) a. Structure (1) Weather (2) Jet Streams (3) Earth (4) Solar System (5) Stars (6) Galaxies (7) Universe (8) Regions of Space b. Near Earth-Space Phenomena - The venture into space resulted in the discerning of many phenomena. These phenomena are sometimes called weather of space and must be considered in planning spaceflight, much the same as in atmospheric flight. (1) Meteoroids (2) Radiation (3) ""Space weather"" APPLICABLE VOCABULARY: air air masses asteroids astrogeology astronomy atmosphere aurora aviation weather barometric pressure celestial sphere clouds comets constellations convection currents cosmic rays density altitude earth eclipse escape velocity evaporation & condensation fog galaxies gravity greenhouse effect humidity Jupiter latitude and longitude lightning Mercury meteors moon Neptune ozone planets Pluto precipitation quasar radiation solar system space weather stars sun turbulence ultraviolet universe Van Allen belts Venus weather wind  II. THE BASIC SCIENCES IN AEROSPACE - The basic sciences underlie all the activities of aerospace. They are often applied in new and unconventional ways and have forced the emergence of obscure branches of a basic science into surprising prominence, even to the point of creating new career fields. One interesting example is cryogenics. A. Astronomy   3 B. C. D. E. F. Biology Chemistry Earth Sciences Electricity and Electronics Flight Sciences 1. Aerodynamics 2. Astrodynamics G.

THE ART AND TECHNIQUES OF FLIGHT - Aeronautical skills have grown from the trial and error techniques of pioneering aviators to precise control of today's sophisticated aircraft. The term ""interface"" has been coined to describe the interrelationship of a man, with his knowledge and capability, and the functioning of his vehicles. The two are a functioning unit. Astronautics and aeronautics form a continuum. Conceptually, navigation, communications, environmental control, instrumentation, etc., are similar in both; but the degree of advancement and sophistication in astronautics is considerable. A.

COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL - The expanding use of aircraft-coupled with their increasing speeds and flight capability require an air traffic control system which can provide precise inflight and terminal area guidance. This task would be hopeless without the aid of electronics. The enormous capacity of electronic computers is becoming increasingly vital to the process of keeping man ahead of his inflight machines. Spaceflight presents far more sophisticated problems in communications and control related to the precision maneuvers required and the sheer magnitude of speeds and distances encountered. Without advanced electronics interfaced with computers, today's spaceflight programs would be virtually impossible. A. Aviation 1. Avionics 2. Air Traffic Control 3. National Airspace System   10 B.

foregoing scope of aerospace material is adapted from Chapter 2: The Scope of Aerospace, by Raymond J. Johnson and Jean F. Blashield of the publication entitled: An Introduction to Aerospace Education, edited by Dr. Mervin K. Strickler, Jr. - see bibliography. Careful study of the above material will illustrate that if one understands the inclusive scope of aerospace it is apparent that there is relevance to every possible educational subject or discipline and one or more facets of aerospace. Clearly, the relationships between education and aerospace require careful study, analysis and understanding before curricular decisions can be made. As will be described later in this paper, there are many ways to design meaningful aerospace education programs. One of the most widely used approaches, both historically and currently, is to relate the information, data, experiences, trends, scientific, mathematic, social, artistic and other facets of aerospace such as economic to regular existing subjects. In the past and currently, there are also many examples of utilizing some or all of aerospace as a specialized subject of study. Which approach used will be determined by each school and community. Many will use both approaches as they are deemed appropriate. One important point to note is that aerospace education can be used effectively without replacing any existing subject or discipline. However it will require relating traditional subjects to appropriate contexts of the many facets of aerospace. Aerospace education is the logical, rational, systematic use of the many disciplines inherent in aerospace to serve as a central motif or thematic approach to the existing curriculum. It may also be an effective area of study in and of an educational offering as either a specialized subject or series of subjects. The most important point is to recognize that aerospace can be an effective means to educational ends. In fact, the career education implications of aerospace education are monumental. HISTORIC EXAMPLES OF AEROSPACE EDUCATION If one believes that the past is prologue, then the future for aerospace education programs is indeed most promising. It is surprising for many to learn that the first evidence of an aviation education class in the United States shows that in 1908, only five years after the Wright brothers flew in 1903, H. Lavonne Twining of the Los Angeles Polytechnic High School used aviation in his physics classes. This is truly remarkable when it is realized that the average time between scientific and technical developments and their entrance into an educational curriculum is often a generation. Following World War I there was increased interest in pioneering aviation throughout the country. During the 1920's there are documented examples of aviation education programs in some schools in every region of the country. One of the earliest examples was the widespread practice of designing, building and flying in contests a variety of model airplanes in formal school settings.   18 THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE FLIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM In 1925 the Galt, California schools had the first public school flight training program at the high school level. The flight training was also related to all of the other relevant school subjects. Although originally limited to the high school, by 1926 a junior college was added to the Galt high school and the flight training and aviation education were designed to begin in the junior year of high school and continue through the two years of junior college. Thus, the Galt school system aviation education program is an early example of both secondary and higher education use of aviation education. This is probably the first example of a tax-supported public institution offering flight instruction to students. By any reasonable measure this is surely the first aviation education magnet school in the United States. It was done by local community initiative. CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE DANIEL GUGGENHEIM FUND The earliest national efforts to design and carry out significant aviation education programs at the elementary, secondary and higher education levels werethose stimulated by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. The far-sighted and visionary initiatives of the Guggenheims created an atmosphere for the early developments of aviation and aviation education that continue to this day. Following are just some highlights of those efforts: Harry F. Guggenheim, in 1927, as President of the Guggenheim Fund described its purposes as having four objectives: To promote aeronautical education, both academic and general. To assist in the extension of fundamental Aeronautical Science. To assist in the development of commercial aircraft. To further the application of aircraft in business, industry and other economic and social activities of the nation. THE FIRST NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON AVIATION EDUCATION To carry out the first objective, the Committee on Elementary and Secondary education was establishhed in 1927. Interestingly, school students of the day played the primary role in the creation of this committee. As an executive committee member of this educational group, Dr. Roland H. Spaulding, then of New Yourk University, wrote: The Guggenheim Fund Committee originated ""as a result of...educators asking for material whhich could be used to satisfy the growing curiosity concerning aviation on the part of the boys and girls in the public schools."" All of us owe a debt of gratitude to those students of the 1920's who asked their teachers for answers to questions the school systems could not provide. But that was not for long. Thanks to Dr. Spaulding's truly pioneering aviation education, or as it was then called, aeronautical education, the foundations of aerospace education were firmly built.   19 EARLY SIGNIFICANT AVIATION EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS Among the seminal publications that were developed were:Problems of Aeronautics in the Schools (1929), Some Present Practices in Secondary Aeronautical Education (1930), and in 1928 Dr. Spaulding wrote: Books on Aeronautics - A Bibliography of Books Likely to be of Use in Elementary and Secondary Schools. There is not an extant similar bibliography as comprehensive as that of 1928. However, there are growing numbers of sources of contemporary aerospace education materials. In 1929, Dr. Roland H. Spaulding's title was Specialist in Elementary and Secondary Aeronautical Education at New York University. He was the first such specialist. GROWTH OF AVIATION EDUCATION IN THE 1920'S Events of an aerospace education nature increased rapidly from the early 1920's until the present time. Just a few illustrative highlights of the events and personalities involved include the following: A World War I naval aviator, Finis E. Engleman, planned and conducted a course in aviation for teachers at Kansas City, Missouri Teachers College in the early 1920's. He was later Chief State School Officer of Connecticut and later President of the Association of American School Administrators. In 1928 Ralph E. Pickett, Chairman of the Department of Vocational Education of New York University gave a lecture entitled: ""Teaching Aeronautical Knowledge by Means of School Activities."" Dr. William F. Durand was a key figure in the early development of significant aeronautical and educationally related programs. He was an original member of the prestigious National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) which was the predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He served as an aeronautical consultant to the government during World War I and World War II. While serving as professor of engineering at Stanford University in 1928, he was asked to talk to the annual conference of the Superintendents of Schools in Boston, Massachusetts. His topic was: ""The Public Needs Aeronautic Education."" This remarkable, historic talk was the first example of reaching school administratorsfrom all of the nation on this important topic. In his talk Durand made the following major points: Aeronautics stands ready to offer to society and to the cause of human progress a service. The public is divided into two classes insofar as aeronautic services are concerned - those who render the service and those who receive it. Education for those rendering aeronautical service must be technical, professional, vocational. For the great public at large - those who receive aeronautical service - the education which is significant is that which will permit them to use wisely and sanely the service offered.   20 There must be developed within the body of society at large something of what is implied in the newly coined word ""airmindedness."" Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris in May of 1927 stimulated unprecedented interest in aviation throughout the United States and the world and many aviation education activities, projects and programs were designed and carried out. In 1930 the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation with the Daniel Guggenheim Fund Committee on Elementary and Secondary Education conducted the First National Conference on Aeronautical Education in St. Louis, Missouri. GROWTH OF AVIATION EDUCATION IN THE 1930'S In April of 1931 a similar conference was held in Detroit, Michigan. In 1932 the United States Office of Education had a bulletin entitled: ""Vocational Training for Aviation Mechanics"" published. Known as Bulletin No. 142, it was written by Robert W. Hambrook, Specialist for Trade and Industrial Education. In 1936 the U.S. Office of Education published another work by Hambrook entitled: ""Aviation in the Public Schools."" During the 1920's and 1930's newly emerging airlines employed educators to help further aviation education. Western Air Express employed Professor Earl W. Hill of the University of Southern California. United Airlines employed a former college president, Dr. William A. Wheatley. These professional educators helped schools and colleges understand the relevance of aviation to education and designed, developed and published materials of instruction for students and teachers. In subsequent years airlines such as Pan American, Trans World Airlines, American Airlines and Eastern Airlines used education oriented leaders such as Ray Mertes (UAL), Dr. John Furbay (TWA), George Gardner (Pan Am), Nicholas Englehardt and Kenneth Newland (AA). The first formal federal legislation designed to promote or foster aviation was the 1926 Air Commerce Act. Current federal efforts to establish airports, provide air navigation facilities, establish airways and provide many other safety and educational programs stem from this activity that was then a part of the Department of Commerce. In 1936 the Bureau of Air Commerce working with the National Education Association (NEA) published in the November issue of the Journal of the NEA a fifteen-page article on aviation education. The suggested activities and sources of materials were widely used by teachers all over the United States.   21 In 1938 the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) evolved from the Bureau of Air Commerce that was established in 1926. In 1940 the Civil Aeronautics Authority became the Civil Aeronautics Administration. The 1938 legislation and subsequent directives laid the foundation for the CAA to provide general development and promotional work on behalf of the newly emerging aviation system of the country. Aviation education programs and activities of the CAA and its successor FAA stem from the development and promotional facets of the 1938 legislation. GATHERING WAR CLOUDS STIMULATE AVIATION EDUCATION Events of the 1930's which led to World War II featured remarkable interest in and pioneering contributions to aviation education. U.S. Office of Education Commissioner John W. Studebaker played a key role in calling the attention of members of Congress and the President and members of his staff to the strides being made both in Germany and the Soviet Union to provide aviation experiences for their youth with a view to motivating and training them to become pilots, mechanics and other aviation workers. In fact, Studebaker's interest and information helped provide the justification for the historic 1939 Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP), the largest peacetime pilot training program ever. Commissioner Studebaker provided leadership for the publication of documents such as ""AirConditioning Young American"" (May, 1942) in which it pointed out, in part: ""... to be air-conditioned means to be in a state of readiness to do something about aviation and not just feel strongly about it. The term, it should be made clear, does not imply vocational proficiency in some field of aviation. Rather, it means a saturation of the American people in aviation skills and a general comprehension of the significance of aviation."" This quotation is from Robert H. Hinckley, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Air who coauthored the publication referred to with Commissioner Studebaker. Studebaker pointed out the immediate (war-time) role of aviation in education and said, ""...first, the immediate relationship of aviation education"" is in the schools to meet ""... wartime needs."" ""... second,"" we must be aware of ""... the relationship of aviation education to the post-war world. Studebaker said: ""Aviation education is here to stay. Although military considerations must be given priority in a nation at war, the schools cannot overlook the fact that the impetus of war needs will also help to usher in a more comprehensive program ofaviation education, long overdue in American schools."" He went on to say:   22 ""We have realized in the Office of Education for a long time the need to provide all possible stimulation and leadership in this important field."" Furthermore, after pointing out the urgent war-time need to prepare high school students for possible military roles in aviation, Studebaker said: ""The objective for the longer future must be to make a functioning program of Aviation Education available to students in all secondary schools."" In early 1942, recognizing the need to greatly increase the supply of qualified potential aviation cadets for the military, Commissioner Studebaker authorized the publication of U.S. Office of Education Leaflet No. 62 entitled: Pre-Aviation Cadet Training in High Schools. This publication provided detailed course outlines and curriculum for a 1942 summer course of from 6 to 12 weeks in length and for a 4 to 6 week course for qualified high school seniors and recent graduates to be given before the end of the 1942 school term. Thousands of students participated in this effort. In May of 1942 the U.S. Office of Education published Leaflet No. 63 which was a more detailed companion booklet to Leaflet No. 62 described above. This publication was entitled: Pre-Flight Aeronautics in Secondary Schools. It provided detailed course outlines for courses ranging from one to four semesters all designed to qualify students to be successful in actual flight training for the military. It was estimated there were 12,000 high schools that offered pre-flight aeronautics to a quarter of a million boys and girls. WORLD'S LARGEST PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM One of the largest aviation education programs designed to train pilots by ground school and preflight study followed by actual flight training took place during the period 1939-1944. From 1939 when it was started as the CPTP program, described earlier, until it becamethe War Training Service (WTS) after Pearl Harbor until it was completed in 1944 this project trained over four hundred thousand pilots for our military. As the Civilian Pilot Training Program starting in 1939 it made use of private aviation contractors, schools and colleges. The academic or ground school work was done by colleges and the flight training by private aviation firms. After we entered the war the entire program was taken over by the military and it continued until our military pilot requirements were met. One of the major accomplishments of this program was the qualification of many women and minority pilots. The complete stories of the CPTP and WTS pilot training programs are told in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publication entitled: The Putt-Putt Air Force. (See the bibliography.) NEW AVIATION EDUCATION MATERIALS FOR TEACHERS Up-to-date, understandable and technically accurate teaching materials were sorely needed for the war-time and post-war needs of teachers, schools and students. In 1940 two teams of writers started and produced 10 volumes of texts that were published by the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). More than one million copies of these were purchased for the CPTP and WTS   23 programs. Meanwhile, two research groups were working to develop teaching materials for civilian schools. In 1942 a massive research and writing project was started under the leadership of Nicholas L. Englehardt of Teachers College, Columbia University with a team of researchers and writers there and at the University of Nebraska. The team producing the materials that became known as the AirAge Education Series was the Aviation Education Research Group. Their manuscripts were published by the MacMillan Company and were used during the rest of the war in many thousands of schools. In fact, they were used for many years after the war. In 1946 Dr. Paul R. Hanna of Stanford University completed the massive research project that resulted in the 900 page volume entitled: Aviation Education Source Book. The book was designed to give teachers, curriculum consultants, textbook writers and aviation educators the materials for use in subject matter areas from kindergarten to the ninth grade. TEACHER AVIATION EDUCATION WORKSHOPS BECOME POPULAR Teacher education workshops were given emphasis during the war and from the post-war era to the present time. In terms of post-war pilot training the so-called veterans training legislation or G.I. Bill provided flight training to more than four hundred thousand veterans of World War II and nearly eighty thousand veterans of the Korean conflict. In 1946 and 1948 the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in cooperation with the American Council on Education (ACE) conducted surveys of Collegiate Courses in Aviation and related fields. In 1946, 372 colleges reported programs and in 1948 there were 331. In the early 1950's the CAA cut back its support and activities in aviation education including producing educational instructional materials and sponsorship of teacher workshops. During the late 1940's and growing in the 1950's Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and the United States Air Force (USAF) expanded its interest in and support of aviation education. CAP produced high school texts and planned, and conducted national aviation education workshops for hundreds of teachers from throughout the nation. Additionally, from that time until the present CAP and USAF staff have provided assistance to hundreds of teacher education workshops each year. On October 5, 1957 the attention startled into massive educational mathematics study in particular. by the Soviet Union created near re-examine the nature and extent of the world and U.S. government officials and educators were efforts to reform and improve education in general, and science and The first ever launch by man of a man-made satellite - Sputnik I panic, consternation and high level and widespread motivation to of education in the United States.  With the creation of the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) which later became the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) starting in the 1960's huge resources for aviation - aerospace education began to become available again.   24  During the last three decades more and more aviation and space industries have dedicated staff and resources to working with teachers and students. In many states, the Department of Transportation and/or Aviation Department provide advice, material and professional consultation to interested educators and students. AEROSPACE EDUCATION MAGNET SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS While there is meager documentation of magnet schools or programs and how they have benefitted students, there are some exceptions. One of the most significant aviation magnet programs based on flight that yielded documentary evidence of positive influences of the program on students is the Richmond United School District of Richmond, California - known as Learning Through Aviation. The Richmond project is the first example of a program of aviation education designed to have a positive influence on students and use a control group to measure and compare educational and related goal attainment. The Richmond experiences and resulting data served to motivate many other school districts and communities to plan aerospace magnet programs and even entire schools. (Much of the following information is adapted from the May, 1978 paper entitled: Learning Through Aviation by Dr. Mervin K. Strickler, Jr. and Charles L. Dobson of the Federal Aviation Administration.) Basically, the so-called Richmond Project was: ""... an innovative educational experiment which used a light, single engine airplane to generate basic instructional and behavioral changes in an inner city junior high school class. The flight project involved twenty-five disadvantaged area, thirteen year old boys and their parents, four regular staff teachers, two pilot instructors and a college student tutor."" Among descriptive characteristics of the group, the project personnel described the students initially as: low and underachieving, having negative self-perception and behavior problems, poor attendance, truancy, having a high rate of suspension and grades too poor to qualify for college entrance. The Richmond authorities were interested in doing a research study to test the hypothesis that the use of actual flight and the associated study of regular class subjects in the context of preparing to fly, navigate, communicate could be verified as contributing to attainment of several worthwhile educational objectives. Thus the research study was designed with the following in view: ""Research objectives included a determination of the value of the flight program in terms of increased motivation. That is, the extent the flight program succeeded in: 1)motivating the students to achieve academically; 2)motivating the students to attend school more regularly; 3) motivating the students to become involved a greater percentage of their classroom time in instructional and less disruptive and resistant behavior; 4) elevating the level of self-esteem   25 and aspiration of the pupils; 5) improving the chances of higher education for the pupils; 6) altering the perception of the teachers and parents of these youths as regards their scholastic ability. The group selected for the flight program had the following characteristics: 1) all male; 2) 80% black; 3) average age 13.3 years; 4) a resident of the disadvantaged or 'target' area for a minimum of five years; 5) low and underachievement as assured by standardized tests and grades in academic subjects; 6) I.Q. scores ranged from a low of 78 to a high of 104; 7) one or more significant behavioral problems associated primarily with school, and/or family background. This group was matched with a control group at another junior high school. Experimental group students were found to range from average to below average in reading ability. In no case did any of the original group evidence a very good ability in reading."" The Richmond project is especially valuable because a control group of students was matched with the Flight Group. The Flight Group, as evidenced by interviews as well as attitude testing, was characterized by: disaffection with school and the education system, low self-confidence, poor self-esteem, little faith in the future, a belief that teachers are prejudiced. The control group represented a nearly opposite series of beliefs. By the end of the first year of the project, the researchers had concluded that their data and observations clearly demonstrated that the Flight Group students had: - developed more positive motivation to achieve academically and make something of their lives. - incurred fewer disciplinary problems than the control group. - attended school more regularly and earned better grades. - showed marked improvement in reading ability. From the opening of the school year in September of 1967 until the Flight Group advanced into and through junior high and high school, it was clear that the project had a profound influence on each student. Details of these effects are spelled out in various reports on the project. The real test of a program of this type is what happens to the students after graduation from high school. Fortunately, this data is available. In 1975, as a result of support by the Oklahoma State University Education and Research Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center and the National Institute of Education, Sociologist and Evaluation Consultant Lee Conway did follow-up interviews with the Richmond Flight Group. His findings are reported in the May, 1976 Journal of Phi Delta Kappa. The article is entitled:Classroom in the Sky: A Power Trip for Disadvantaged Youth.   26  Conway's follow-up evaluation led him to conclude: ""Remarkable transformation in the character and competence of these young men had occurred."" The area of Conway's follow-up included: Academic progress Employment Self-Esteem Parental Backing Sense of Mastery  Conway's conclusions include the following (as reported in the May, 1976 article in the Phi Delta Kappan): ""The many successes of the flight project and its unexpected positive results appear to be caused by the youths' involvement in a high-status activity, elimination of the fear of failure, changed expectations on the part of significant others in their lives, acquisition of unique skills, and the opportunity for significant achievement in the dominant culture. This longitudinal study has produced considerable hard data as well as qualitative results supportive of the flight project concept. Former project youths are demonstrably better off than controls in the areas of employment, advanced education and avoidance of deviance. Finally, project youths appear to have grasped the linkage between advanced schooling and career potential as their essential and available source of power. Flight brought a sense of joy to these youths and overcame their pervasive feelings of alienation and worthlessness. Their flight instructor's non-critical, non-threatening evaluation their abilities gave them a sense of 'specialness' which overcame the judgmental, negative attitudes to which they had grown accustomed. Our evaluation data appear to prove that moral and imaginative capacity, not measured achievement or tested intelligence (I.Q.) are the real defining characteristics of human beings."" Clearly, the many ways in which this program touched the lives of students, parents, instructor and others associated with them is remarkable. However, the influences this carefully researched and documented program had on other schools and communities may well be of even greater significance described in the information that follows. The concepts that were so well planned and carried out in the Richmond, California schools starting in 1967 were spread to the District of Columbia school system as early as late 1968 and early 1969 and were used in Cardozo High School under the leadership of an imaginative teacher, Mrs. Bernice Thorpe. AUGUST MARTIN HIGH SCHOOL - PIONEER AEROSPACE MAGNET During 1968 in the borough of Queens in New York City members of the community including parents, labor, education, industry and government explored how they might use or adapt the Richmond school techniques toestablish an entire high school as a magnet-aerospace-thematic   27 program. The result of the study and research in New York pointed to the feasibility of establishing a high school with the entire educational program built around aerospace. thus, the joint planning efforts of the various groups resulted in a 1969 authorization by the New York City Board of Education to convert the old, traditional and increasingly ineffective Woodrow Wilson High School into a comprehensive high school with emphasis on air-transport and related aviation, space and transportation careers. After two years of careful planning, the new school was opened in September, 1971. It was named August Martin High School. August Martin was one of the first black commercial airline pilots in the United States. He learned to fly in the CPTP-WTS flight training program described earlier. He was killed while he was a pilot in command of a volunteer relief flight to Biafra. The original Woodrow Wilson School was a vocational school with 3,100 students when it was opened in the early 1940's. By 1965 its enrollment had declined to 810 students. Average daily attendance had declined from a high of 80% to 50% of the students attending daily classes. By the late 1960's students no longer took the State and Regional Examination in subjects based on citywide tests in either academic, shop, or vocational courses. Parents, students, the Board of Education and the community knew that it was a school in name only. One of the guidelines of the task force and planning committee that set out to plan and create a new comprehensive high school to replace the traditional vocationally oriented high school was to create an educational institution that would be exciting for parents and students, but with an innovative and educationally sound program. Thus, the committee adopted aerospace first, as a magnet to attract interested students from throughout the city and, second, because aerospace, by definition, provided an outline related to all facets of the academic and occupational or career programs that it was anticipated the new high school would offer its students. Those responsible for planning the August Martin High School recognized that to be attractive the new school had to relate to the world of today and tomorrow while being tied to the real world of work. Thus it wasdecided to use aerospace as the central theme, motif or core running through the offerings. It is interesting to note that the August Martin planning committee was fully familiar with the landmark study that had been done with the Richmond, California Learning Through Aviation Project. From the time August Martin opened, it has averaged a daily attendance of more than 90%. It ranks as the highest level academic secondary school in Queens. The student body is made up of 95% minority students of whom most are black. The students come from throughout the city and it is noted for rigorous entrance and performance criteria. Records show that August Martin students are achievers. From a curriculum design point of view, all of the disciplines taught in the school are related, as appropriate, to aviation, space or transportation. Much more detailed information on this facet of the program may be found in the FAA publication entitled: A Model Aerospace Curriculum, August Martin High School which is listed in the bibliography. Excerpts from this publication describing   28 community activities and the curriculum are included in the Curriculum Options and Models section of this publication. The school is very near John F. Kennedy International Airport. Many of the aviation, industry and government agency people associated with this huge international aviation center work closely with faculty and students. While some students do get jobs at JFK International Airport, the majority of the graduates go on to post-secondary education. Among the many agencies working with the August Martin faculty and student body since the school was started is the Aviation Development Council of New York City. This small non-profit group which works on behalf of various aviation interests works with the private sector, government agencies and the local community to foster aviation via education. Among their many successful projects that use the Learning Through Aviation approach is a special program that was done under contract with the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). In this program four hundred and fifty youths, ages twelve to eighteen, were given basic ground school instruction and actual flight instruction of up to ten hours. Each participant had been referred to the juvenile court system and, exceptfor this program, would be processed through the usual correctional institutions. The results of this program have been remarkable. Young people who had previously shown no interest in school or learning demonstrated an interest in mathematics and science as these are needed tools in learning to fly. At the time this program was conducted, the per youth cost of traditional juvenile justice handling of such young people was $14,000.00 per year. By whatever criteria one wants to consider, this approach merits widespread study. The foregoing are just a few illustrative examples of what others have done based on the experiences gained and documented in Richmond, California in the program called Learning Through Aviation. Two other such examples of using that approach follow. AN UPWARD BOUND LEARNING THROUGH AVIATION PROJECT In 1974 Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University of Daytona Beach, Florida was awarded a contract by the U.S. Office of Education to conduct an Upward Bound Program using aviation as a motivational means of education. According to the final report of the Embry-Riddle project it was pointed out the overall goal of the program was to use aviation as a tool to motivate financially disadvantaged high school students to continue their educational experiences into post-secondary education. The project group met on weekends using the university dormitories, classrooms, counseling and other resources. Actual aviation oriented studies were used to stimulate improvement in reading, mathematics and science skills. The 1974-1975 group included sixty-five students who met the criteria referred to earlier. Twenty-one of the group were high school seniors. At the close of the first year project, twenty of the seniors had been accepted for college and the remaining one received post-secondary technical training in the Air Force. Progress made in other areas included: 69% of the total group showed improvement in their school grade point average, 65% of the group initially showed reading performance below grade 9 level and 22% of this group raised their reading level by   29 the end of the program, while 39% of the balance of the group raised their reading level by one year. These are clearly measurable results. This program was continued in subsequent years in both the regular school year and in a summer program. In each instance, positive results were attained. In later programs, actual flying was a part of the program to provide a flying classroom application for ground studies. Impressive advances were made in language, communication, mathematics and science areas. RANDALL AEROSPACE AND MARINE SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM (RAMS) One of the most interesting applications of the experiences learned from the Richmond, California Learning Through Aviation Program and the Jamaica, New York August Martin thematic program emerged in the District of Columbia in 1975. This project is an excellent example of how two themes may be used in designing and carrying out a magnet educational program. While many people contributed to the planning and operation of this program, the two prime movers were teachers in the school: Mr. Raymond L. Compton, Aerospace Director and Dr. Richard N. Podgorny, Marine Science Director. When the Program started, Randall school was a junior high school. After the first year of the program that was originally planned for the eighth and ninth grades the Board of Education decided to change the junior high school to a grade 9-12 senior high school. This transition complicapeople contributed to the planning and operation of this program, the two prime movers were teachers in the school: Mr. Raymond L. Compton, Aerospace Director and Dr. Richard N. Podgorny, Marine Science Director. When the Program started, Randall school was a junior high school. After the first year of the program that was originally planned for the eighth and ninth grades the Board of Education decided to change the junior high school to a grade 9-12 senior high school. This transition complicaan experienced pilot and aircraft owner and Dr. Podgorny was trained in the biological sciences and oceanography; there was, nearby, the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Administration and their professional aviation education staff who had pledged consultant help to the school. A Deputy Superintendent of the D.C. schools encouraged the principal and the two key faculty to proceed with their ideas for the thematic magnet school. The U.S. Office of Educationprovided an ESEA Title IV grant to assist in planning and evaluation of the program. One of the greatest outcomes of the RAMS project and some of the reasons it could function successfully was the help of community interests throughout the program. Among those regularly providing technical and other kinds of assistance were: Federal Aviation Administration National Capital Parks' Lightship Chesapeake National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Washington Metropolitan Police Department Harbor Section National Transportation Safety Board National Aquarium Congressional Flying Club U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary U.S. Navy Civil Air Patrol - National Capital Wing   30 Tuskegee Airmen's Association - National and Washington Chapters University of the District of Columbia Aerospace and Marine Science Departments David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center National Red Cross Kiwanis Club The RAMS staff had fine community resources to help them. In fact, all successful magnet school programs make full use of available community resources. One of the objectives of the RAMS program from its inception was to relate career opportunities to students. Follow-up studies of RAMS graduates suggest that this was an important and appreciated objective of the program. Those responsible for planning and evaluating magnet schools would do well to study the process and techniques that were designed for the RAMS program. It is probable that RAMS had the best and most comprehensive Evaluation Studies done of any similar program. Dr. Isadore Goldberg, Principal Investigator of Creative Research Associates, Inc. of Silver Springs, Maryland designed and carried out 1977 and 1978 evaluations. His studies were part of the conditions of the grant money made available to the District of Columbia Schools. His studies werecoordinated and developed for the Division of Planning, Research and Evaluation of the D.C. Schools. These reports were published and distributed by the Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Education Programs Division. For details of more magnet school evaluations, see the Section entitled: Evaluating Magnet Projects, Activities and Programs in this publication. THE FUTURE FOR AEROSPACE MAGNET SCHOOLS The November, 1991 Little Rock, Arkansas National Conference on Aerospace Magnet Schools bodes well for future aerospace magnet schools. Many excellent examples of such schools and programs were represented at the conference and their representatives generously shared their experiences - success as well as shortcomings and challenges. It is apparent that one of the newest aerospace magnet schools in the nation will be the one currently in the planning stage by the Little Rock School System. Hopefully, the Little Rock magnet school will build on the lessons learned from past programs and contemporary examples. In one major way, Little Rock has some advantages over all of the other past and existing aerospace magnet school programs. When the Little Rock project becomes a reality - hopefully sooner rather than later - it will be unique among such projects. When FAA Administrator James B. Busey visited Little Rock on April 12, 1991 he said, ""This is the first time that a magnet school and an aviation museum have been planned together from the ground up. That's never been done before."" On November 20, 1992 at the Second Annual National Aviation Magnet School Conference, in Phoenix, Arizona, FAA Deputy Regional Administrator Fanny Rivera stated:   31 ""FAA sponsorship of this conference demonstrates our resolve to promote aviation in the classroom. It reinforces our commitment to foster the development of quality high school aviation programs. The interdisciplinary, thematic approach, one that uses aviation as the key which binds together - mathematics, science, language arts, social studies, history and art - can help forge new ways to motivate students to gain the most from their education."" All who have learned of the combination of cooperative interests in aerospace and aerospace education in Arkansas in general and the Little Rock area in particular realize that a truly historic educational innovation is underway. The nation's first aerospace education magnet school in conjunction with a first class aerospace museum will soon be a reality. A site for this joint enterprise has already been selected and it will be on the grounds of the Little Rock airport. When this new museum and school program start, it will serve as a national model of what a 21st century aerospace magnet education program could become. ""In both mathematics and science, a growing body of research documents that hands-on activities, problem solving, use of technology, and student-centered learning are the most effective ways to improve students' achievement and sustain their interest, yet most course work still relies predominantly on lecturing and reliance on textbooks."" ""... those of you who have been involved in equity and in choice, especially with magnet schools, have accomplished a great deal. You are among those who have led the way out of the status quo. You have forged partnerships such as those which Little Rock, the Federal Aviation Administration and other concerned community and industry interests are developing with Little Rock's emerging aerospace magnet model."" Alicia Coro   1 SECTION V - FAA AND AVIATION EDUCATION YESTERDAY - TODAY - TOMORROW For more than thirty years FAA has had aviation education programs, activities and learning materials for students of all grade levels and for teachers. FAA aviation and educational specialists have worked with several hundred colleges and universities, thousands of school systems and dozens of aviation industries in designing aviation education programs that are appropriate to the educational institution or industry. Today FAA's aviation education programs cover the spectrum of education from kindergarten through elementary, middle, high school, community/junior college and four year college (K - 12 16). In 1993, for the first time, all of the aviation education programs are located in one office in the Washington headquarters of FAA. They are a part of the Office of Training and Higher Education. In 1978 FAA became interested in designing specialized post-secondary educational programs to educate its workforce of the future. In 1983, FAA received the approval of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Congress to start a special college program. This is known as the Airway Science Program (AWS). Following are highlights of details of the origins and present state of FAA's aviation education programs. As described earlier in the section documenting historical events in the chronology of aviation education, the federal predecessor agencies to FAA planned and carried out a variety of important and pioneering aviation education programs that covered elementary, secondary and teacher education. AUTHORITY FOR AVIATION EDUCATION PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS Various statutory and policy statements have outlined the authority for and nature and extent of FAA aviation education programs. The Air Commerce Act of 1926 encouraged the federal government to ""... foster the growth of civil aviation."" Events during the 1930's and leading to the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) grew out of Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) initiatives. The many aeronautic education programs during and right after World War II have already been described. The 1958 Federal Aviation Agency Act charged the FAA to foster and promote the growth and development of civil aeronautics and air commerce. By 1976, FAA was already a constituent agency of the Department of Transportation (DOT), and Congress passed legislation (Title 49 of U.S. Code, Section 134a) which provided: ""In furtherance of his mandate to promote civil aviation, the Secretary of Transportation acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall take such action as he may deem necessary, within available resources, to establish a civil aviation   2 information distribution program within each region of the Federal Aviation Administration. Such program shall be designed so as to provide state and local school administrators, college and university officials, and officers of civil and other organizations, upon request, with informational materials and expertise on various aspects of civil aviation."" FAA AIRWAY SCIENCE CURRICULUM PROGRAM The original idea for what is now the Airway Science Program (AWS), started with Mr. Lynn Helms, then FAA Administrator. As pointed out in the 1993 FAA publication,Airway Science Curriculum Proposal Information and Instructions, the program history is described in part as follows: ""The AWS Task Force was formed in 1981 at the request of Mr. Lynn Helms ... to design a generic curriculum for the proposed AWS program. The University Aviation Association (UAA) was asked to appoint Task Force members who would be representative of college and university programs throughout the United States. Because the AWS Program was a baccalaureate curriculum, the original Task Force represented institutions offering that degree. Shortly thereafter it was recognized that community colleges granting the associate degree might participate in the program by offering the lower division course work in the core curriculum. As a result, a community college representative was appointed to the Task Force."" On July 7, 1983, under the authority of Title VI of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Office of Personnel Management gave FAA final approval to proceed with its proposed: ""Demonstration Project: Airway Science Curriculum."" As described in the Federal Register, Volume 48, No. 137, Friday, July 15, 1983, FAA ""...has submitted a proposal for consideration as a demonstration project ... entitled 'Airway Science Curriculum Demonstration Project.'"" The FAA described this historic higher education project in the above-referenced Federal Register: ""The purpose of the project is to compare performance, job attitudes, and perceived potential for supervisory positions of individuals recruited for several of FAA's technical occupations who have an aviation-related college level education, or its equivalent, with individuals recruited for the same occupations through traditional methods. In order to accomplish this purpose, FAA, with assistance from the University Aviation Association, developed a model Airway Science Curriculum which emphasizes college level courses in aviation, science and technology, mathematics, management, and general studies. Applicants for FAA positions as air traffic controller, electronic technician, aviation safety inspector, and computer specialist who enter through the demonstration Airway Science Announcement will be rated on their possession of the knowledges, skills, abilities, and other characteristics contained in the model Airway Science Curriculum and ranked and selected from a separate register parallel to those currently in use. Additionally, applicants for air traffic controller positions must pass the air traffic control examination, and applicants for aviation safety inspector must hold listed certificates and ratings.""   3  The FAA higher education demonstration project was considered a success and after further development the Airway Science (AWS) Curriculum program was started. The goal of the AWS program is to develop a broad base of aviation technicians and managers for the FAA and private industry. The AWS curriculum program was originally under the management of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It became an FAA operational program on December 31, 1990. As of 1993, the program includes both two-year associate degree and four-year baccalaureate degree fields of study. As of 1993 fifty-three (53) AWS programs are offered in colleges granting baccalaureate degrees in five areas of specialization. Not all colleges offer all five specializations. Six do. Others offer one to four. The five areas of specialization are: Airway Science Management Airway Computer Science Aircraft Systems Management Airway Electronic Systems Aviation Maintenance Management  Each program prepares students for success in a specific career. In mid-1993 2,157 students were enrolled in the AWS curriculum program. The program is one way of helping FAA achieve diversity in the workforce - as of mid-1993 34% of the students were minority and 12% female. In addition to the decade-old four-year college program FAA, in February of 1993, announced an associate degree (2-year college) program. Degrees are offered in three areas: - Flight Technology - Airway Electronics Technology - Aviation Maintenance Technology These two-year programs use a mix of technical and general courses similar to the four-year degree programs allowing community college students who have completed requirements for an associate degree to continue in a four-year program if they wish. AIRWAY SCIENCE CURRICULUM DETAILS The Five (5) AWS curricular offerings each have two major components. The first is known as the Core Subject Area and all five specialized programs include some of the same core subjects. Other core subjects are related to specialties such as those requiring mathematics, science, technology, computer science, management or aviation. They are:   4  Core Subject Area General Studies English Composition Oral Communication Psychology Humanities and Social Science Electives Range of Credits Semester Hours 3 3 3 15-21 24-30  This area includes course work which teaches both oral and written communications skills. Specifically, written communication must include instruction in forms of expository writing. Oral communication skills include both formal and informal methods of verbal communication. In addition, course work relevant to this area will include instruction in the following topics: (i) the social, cultural, political and economic development of American and/or Western civilization; (ii) the study of human behavior; and (iii) the cultural aspects of knowledge such as philosophy, art, drama, music, literature, religion or language.

Thus, the Airway Science Program is an FAA aviation education partnership with the academic community. This partnership is forged to prepare technically qualified people for the thousands of jobs needed to support the modernization of all elements of the aviation system. Highly qualified people are needed in both industry and government. New concepts for designing, developing and operating high technology equipment as well as creating efficient procedures and new ways of solving problems require a new type of individual. The 21st century employee must be one who can flourish in a culturally diverse, technical, scientific environment - a person who can think, plan, organize and manage machines as well as people.   10 The FAA started the Airway Science Program as one method of helping prepare the next generation of aviation technicians and managers for employment in government, industry and education. The results to date suggest the program is succeeding in meeting these national needs. Any educational institution, industry, student or anyone desiring information about the Airway Science Program should consult the Resources Section of this publication. HOW THE K-12 AND OTHER FAA AVIATION EDUCATION PROGRAMS RELATE TO THE AIRWAY SCIENCE PROGRAM Specialists in career choice indicate that the earlier a child has an opportunity to become aware of any career field, the more likely a decision will be made to enter that field. Another facet of early career awareness projects and activities is that young people find careers that may be attractive as well as those they do not wish to explore further. FAA's aviation education programs, materials, partnerships with organizations and industries include emphasis on the wide range of aviation careers. FAA is currently reaching its broad-based aviation education goals via the programs and projects described below. CURRENT FAA K-12 AND POST-SECONDARY AVIATION EDUCATION PROGRAMS FAA continues a tradition of using a variety of activities, special projects and aviation education programs to reach young people and adults. The current FAA aviation education programs include: 1. Aviation Career Education ""ACE"" Academy (Secondary) ACE Academies are one-week summer aviation education programs for high school students cosponsored by the FAA and host state organizations. This program provides students with a wide range of aviation career exploration experiences. Focus is on aviation career clusters identified by FAA, with emphasis on opportunities for women and minorities. The plan is to have one program in each state and U.S. territory. This program reaches 1,500-2,000 students each summer. 2. Federal Information Exchange (FEDIX) (K-12 - Post Secondary) FEDIX is an on-line computer-based information service that links the education community and the federal government to educational information services. FEDIX provides a complete agency organizational and program profile for university administrators, professors, teachers and students. Information on aviation education programs and resources available from FAA headquarters, regions, centers, and facilities may be included in the database. Details on aviation education initiatives of aviation industry and special interest groups are also available. FEDIX is linked to the Minority On-Line Information System (MOLIS) whichfeatures current data on all Historically Black Colleges & Universities and other minority educational institutions. FEDIX currently has 22,000 users, and 2,000 new users each month. Anyone with a computer and a modem can link up with FEDIX by calling 1-800-783-3349 and log in by typing ""FEDIX."" 3. Aviation Education Resource Centers (AERC) (K-12 - Post Secondary)   11  Aviation Education Resource Centers function as information distribution centers for FAA aviation education materials and resources. They are used by educators, the media and the general public. Resource Centers are located at colleges, museums and state aviation authority offices. Resource centers maintain and provide quantities of FAA printed materials, videotapes and computer educational software. Center personnel also answer general information requests, conduct workshops and make aviation-related presentations. In 1993 there are 82 AERC's. It is planned to dedicate 25 additional AERC locations. This program reaches 100,000 educators and others each year. 4. FAA Aviation Education Volunteer Counselors (K-12 - Undergraduate and Graduate) FAA will select, provide orientation and appoint volunteer resource personnel to coordinate with headquarters, region and center aviation education officers to implement FAA aviation education programs. FAA volunteers are designed as official Aviation Education Counselors. Counselors assist FAA in promoting aviation education and fostering a wider knowledge, and better understanding of FAA, the National Airspace System and civil aviation in America. It is planned to conduct a counselor workshop in headquarters and one in each FAA region and center. Each volunteer counselor will be provided a specially prepared guide and other aviation education curriculum and guideline materials. 5. Government-Industry-Education Partnerships (All Levels) Industry partnerships such as with: General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), American Helicopter Society/Helicopter Association International (AHS/HAI), National Association of State Aviation Officials (NASAO), Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), Aircraft Electronics Association (AEA), National Air Transportation Association (NATA) and the Opportunity Skyway program increase public awareness and enhancement of the role of aviation and support aviation education programs at alllevels of the educational system. These private sector/public or government education partnerships are increasingly important in working toward increased excellence in education. Each partnership yields additional resources to support the FAA's aviation program initiatives. In 1993, FAA plans to formalize six new industry and education partnerships. 6. National Congress on Aviation & Space Education - NCASE (All Levels) In partnership with NASA and USAF-Civil Air Patrol, FAA participates annually by presenting teacher workshops and crosstalk sessions to exchange ideas on what is being done to promote aerospace education throughout the nation. The 1993 NCASE was held in Orlando, Florida, April 28 - May 1. FAA directed the 1993 NCASE. This program reaches 1,000-1,500 teachers and 25,000 students a year. 7. Aviation Magnet School Programs (Elementary and Secondary)   12  Magnet schools are a popular trend in elementary and secondary schools in America. They are excellent feeder programs for FAA's Airway Science Programs. Several Aviation Magnet Secondary schools have been funded by the U.S. Department of Education. In 1992, FAA administered the first Aviation Magnet Secondary Grant Program directed by Congress. In 1991 and 1992 FAA planned and conducted the first two National Aviation Magnet School Conferences and will conduct the third in November, 1993 in Louisville, Kentucky. These conferences provide an opportunity to exchange information and curriculum planning on a nation-wide basis. In 1993, FAA published a guide to planning aviation magnet activities, projects and programs that includes sample programs of middle schools and high schools. This publication provides models for any school system to modify or adapt. 8. DC-3/Flying Classroom/Simulator Program (Public) The vintage DC-3 aircraft, N-34, provides an educational static display at airshows and communities across the country. the exhibit now demonstrates the new microflight simulator and software. The Flying Classroom program will eventually provide schools with surplus FAA computers. This program reaches over a million people a year. 9. Aviation Education Workshops for Teachers (Graduate & Undergraduate) Principal focus is to provide teachers with information on FAA's aviation education programs and materials and to prepare them to teach aviation in the classroom. Workshops are conducted by approximately 250 colleges and universities annually. FAA provides information, materials, and/or speakers to each program. Counselor workshops are conducted at selected teacher workshops. 10. Adopt-A-School Program (K-12) The Adopt-A-School partnership in education program encourages FAA personnel to get involved to share personal knowledge and aviation experience with educators and students. The program matches aviation skills, expertise, knowledge and resources of FAA with the needs of the educational objectives of local schools. FAA is identifying adopt-a-school locations in each region. This program reaches an estimated 25 schools a year. 11. International Science and Engineering Fair (Secondary) FAA is a co-sponsor of this prestigious annual competition for more than 700 students from the United States and some other countries. FAA is joined by several aviation organizations such as the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA), Air Transport Association (ATA), Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA), Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) in providing scholarships and awards that recognize the achievements of high school science and engineering projects. (This program is managed by the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. See Resources Section of this publication for address information.) 12. International Aviation/Space Art Contest (K-12) (Ages 5-16)   13  Each year FAA cooperates with the National Aeronautic Association (NAA), the National Association of State Aviation Officials (NASAO) and the International Committee on Aviation and Space Education of the Paris, France-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI). Students ages five through sixteen may participate in categories related to their age level. National and international awards are given. Students from the United States regularly compete successfully for some of the international awards. 13. Aviation Science Instruction Program (ASIP) This is an aviation education computer software program for students in grades six to eight. It is designed to inform and to help motivate students to study science and mathematics. ASIP uses an Apple II computer with the programs written in BASIC. The educational benefits of this material include using the computer to illustrate programming, graphics display methods and simple animation techniques. ASIP includes programs on three important topics: Navigation and Flight planning Principles of Flight Aviation and Our Environment This program is available to school systems only from the FAA Aviation Education Resource Center (AERC) at University of North Alabama, UNA Box 5145, Florence, Alabama 35632-0001, (202) 844-2434. 14. Air Bear Program (K-2) This is a national partnership program done in cooperation with FAA, NASAO, the women's pilot organization known as the Ninety-Nines and the state of Illinois Division of Aeronautics. The program is designed for children in kindergarten through second grade. Students go on an imaginary flight to Disneyland when the ""Air Bear"" visits a classroom. Information on this program is available from FAA Regional Aviation Education Offices (see Resources section for nearest office).  FAA'S AVIATION EDUCATION PROGRAMS LOOK TO THE FUTURE The foregoing represents brief highlights of FAA's current aviation education activities. Basically, FAA recognizes that the 21st century National Airspace System (NAS) will be designed, operated and maintained by a highly skilled, technically and scientifically literate workforce of culturally diverse people. Educators, representatives of aviation and related industries, organizational and local, municipal, state and federal officials who see the need for new aviation education initiatives or who know about educationally attractive programs for students and teachers should communicate with FAA for possible opportunities to cooperate. FAA officials have always known they have a responsibility to work with educators and all elements of the public to help everyone understand the nature and the extent of the nation's aviation system. Furthermore, FAA plans to seek ways to help improve safety and to make education even more   14 meaningful and effective by using appropriate examples of aviation education in helping schools and colleges, as resources permit. In the process, educational excellence and a safe, efficient, economical national system of air transportation will result. ""Aerospace magnet programs are a promising development that can have a real impact on meeting ..."" the goal to ""... seek to place the United States first in the world in mathematics and science achievement."" Alicia Coro   1 SECTION VI - CURRICULUM MODELS Anyone interested in planning an educationally sound aviation education program that is relevant for preparing young people to deal with issues, be literate and introduced to various aviation, space, transportation careers will be well advised to consult the following programs. These range from historic early programs that have worked for many years to recent programs designed as magnet schools to help resolve problems of racial and ethnic imbalances and segregation as spelled out in federal standards. All four of these programs are, in the full and literal sense, magnet programs. They all attract students. Furthermore, they have in common the fact that they work. AUGUST MARTIN HIGH SCHOOL In the early 1940's, Woodrow Wilson Vocational High School was opened in the Baisley Park section of Queens, New York. By 1948, the Woodrow Wilson School had more than 3,100 students in a main building and three annexes. Within seventeen years, by June, 1965, enrollment had declined to 802 students officially listed on the rolls. Average daily student attendance had also declined from a high of over 80% to only approximately 50% of the students enrolled attending classes daily by the late 1960's. Woodrow Wilson High School students no longer took the State and Regional Examination in subjects based on city-wide tests in either academic, shop or vocational courses. In the late 1960's, parents, leaders from the aviation industry, community organizations, labor, and education formed a committee to see what could be done about the deteriorating Woodrow Wilson Vocational High School. It should be noted that the high school was located near John F. Kennedy International Airport; thus, the representatives of the aviation industry had an interest in helping assure that the program offerings took advantage of the rich vocational career and academic offerings of aviation. The key aviation leadership for evaluating Woodrow Wilson High School was provided by the Aviation Development Council of New York City. This organization represented the principal airlines and related aviation industries in the greater metropolitan New York area. The committee, looking at solutions for remedying the problems at Woodrow Wilson High School, determined that a dramatic change had to be made. Thus, on October 3, 1969 this committee obtained a resolution from the New York City Board of Education permitting ""the conversion of Woodrow Wilson High School into a comprehensive high school with emphasis on air-transport careers."" Immediately following this official action, a planning committee was created by the community of interests outlined above and a set of sub-committees was established to work on such topics as curriculum development, administrative selections, industry union relationships, work-study opportunities, needed plant expansions, program development, staff training, and public and community relations. The planning committee and the various sub-committees spent nearly two years of detailed intensive planning to create the new school.   2 One of the guidelines of the task force and planning committee was that the new comprehensive school in Queens, New York, designed to replace the traditional Woodrow Wilson vocationally oriented high school, would be exciting for parents and students, but with an innovative and educationally sound program. Thus, the committee adopted aerospace first, as a magnet to attract interested students from throughout the city and, second, because aerospace by definition provided an outline related to all facets of the academic and occupational or career programs that it was anticipated the new high school would offer its students. Rationale for an Aerospace Thematic School Those responsible for planning the August Martin High School recognized that to be attractive the new school had to relate to the world of today and tomorrow while being tied to the real world of work. Thus, the group decided to use aerospace as the central theme, motif, or core running through the offerings. THE AUGUST MARTIN PROGRAM A Comprehensive High School August Martin is a comprehensive high school. In the ninth and tenth grades, pupils take a heavy concentration of academic subjects. In the eleventh and twelfth grades they have an opportunity to continue in either college preparatory, business career, or aerospace occupational programs. Curriculum In the ninth and tenth grades, all students take the five major subjects (English, Social Studies, Science, Algebra and Foreign Language), plus Practical Arts (Ninth Grade), Typing (Tenth Grade), Independent Study, and Health Education. In the eleventh and twelfth grades, students may follow either of the following tracks. - The College Preparation Course - continue academic subjects and electives, or - Business Education Program - training in Accounting, Secretarial Work, or Data Processing. In addition, Martinites will have the chance to take Business Management, Passenger Servicing, Marketing, Advertising, etc., or - Occupational Training in such aerospace fields as: Maintenance and Repair of Ground Support Vehicles, Avionics, Airport Maintenance, Flight Planning and Instruction, Aerospace Design, Aerial Photography, Aerospace Medical Technology, Travel and Tourism, Meteorology, Pre-Flight Attendant Training, Federal Aviation Laws and Regulations.   3  Comprehensive Guidance Program In seeking to help students make critical decisions regarding course selections, the school provides the following: Four guidance interviews a year for each student. Group guidance sessions. A concentrated tenth-grade program. Career Day. College Night.  INNOVATIVE FEATURES Administrative Features The August Martin Advisory Commission and administration have sought to institute in the school tried and tested innovative administrative and curriculum features. Among the school's special administrative features are: - A nine-period day of seven hours for all students (40 minutes longer than that enjoyed by almost all New York City high school students). - A four-cycle year (school is reorganized four times a year when students receive new programs). - Modular scheduling (time blocks of two or three 20-minute modules to permit a variety of teaching techniques). - Students have a different program every day of the week. - A computer terminal, tied to the University Application Processing Center, provides the school with daily attendance information, cyclical scheduling, personnel information, etc. - Contract or free busing to transport students living in the extremities of Queens and Brooklyn. - A daily bus for field trips to JFK Airport and the city's resources. Curriculum Innovations Among the curriculum innovations are: - Students take sequential subjects like mathematics and foreign language at different levels (4, 6 and 8 cycles).   4  - All students take Elementary Algebra and Foreign Language. - All sciences have a lab period. - All students take Practical Arts courses in the ninth grade. - All students take Typing in the tenth grade. - All students are required to take a cycle of the Principles of Flight (Science) and the Air Age (Social Studies) in their freshman year. - After completing required courses, students may choose from a wide variety of hundreds of mini-courses. - Independent Study, a part of every pupil's daily program, affords pupils an opportunity to take a Master Kit for either advance or repeat work under supervision and to obtain tutorial help. The school operates six resource centers and a multi-media library as part of the Independent Study program. AEROSPACE ACTIVITIES Supplementary to the school's aerospace curriculum, August Martin High School has developed special activities and programs which reinforce and expand upon the school's central magnet concept. Several of these activities are described below: Construction of the Wright Flyer Replica In 1976 August Martin High School and the Port of Authority of New York and New Jersey were involved in a unique bicentennial celebration activity. With assistance from the Port Authority, the students and staff of August Martin High School constructed a full-scale replica of the original ""Wright Flyer"" from blueprints supplied by the Smithsonian Institution. The flyer was the airplane in which the Wright Brothers - Wilbur and Orville - demonstrated the feasibility of heavier-than-air aircraft in flight (December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina). Constructed in one of the school's new shops, the plane (with a wing span of forty feet) was exact in every detail except for a simulated engine. The fabric and wood were treated to simulate the aging process of the original plane. The new vehicle had to be built in sections so that it could be transported from the school's shop to the International Arrivals Building at John F. Kennedy Airport. There it was reassembled; it replaced the huge Calder mobile that had been suspended from the rotunda ceiling at the International Arrivals Building. In a dedication ceremony held at Kennedy Airport on June 11, 1976, the Wright Flyer was officially installed for all visitors to see. In addition the students and staff constructed a four-panel picture story depicting the story of the Wright Flyer replica project from its conception to the dedication;   5 this was also placed on display on the mezzanine floor of the International Arrivals Building at John F. Kennedy Airport. Flying Program August Martin High School has conducted an ambitious flying program for its students since 1973. Started with Law Enforcement Administration funding and in cooperation with the State University at Farmingdale, the project has been continued with the aid of a mini-grant and federal funding. Students in the program have been organized into three main groups: beginners, intermediates and advanced. A licensed pilot and flying instructor has been conducting the ground instruction courses at August Martin High School as a regular part of the school's curriculum. Qualified students have been taken to the State University at Farmingdale where the university's instructors have given them simulator time. They then take their flying lessons in university-owned planes at nearby Republic Airport. In 1977, some 140 martinites had an average of six hours flying experience. Both in June and January of each year, students have been encouraged to take the FAA private Pilot's written examination. Students also have purchased flight jackets bearing the words Martin Pilots on the back. Several students have soloed, although the program's main aim has been to emphasize its motivational values in improving pupils' reading, mathematic, and learning skills. Civil Air Patrol In 1977 a Civil Air Patrol squadron was formed at August Martin High School. On March 21, 1977, a table of organization was developed and officers selected. To date, some fifty students have joined the squadron. The officers plan to gradually increase the membership and hope to soon have at the school one of the largest squadrons in the New York City area. Among the program's objectives are the following: training and instruction in aerospace education, civil defense, aircraft search and rescue, and customs and courtesies. Students' continued participation depends upon their response to the program's educational and disciplinary requirements and their ability to work up to capacity. Inflight Excursions and Apollo 16 Before the fuel shortage crisis, every freshman had an opportunity to take part in an airborne geography-geology lesson over the metropolitan area in a 707 jet paid for by both American Airlines and Pan American World Airways. The trips generally took the students across Long Island and the Sound, up into Connecticut, above the Catskill Mountains, along the Delaware Water Gap and the Jersey shore, and then above the lower part of Ne York City. The ship's captain provided the pupils with pertinent information regarding the principles of flight and pointed out landmarks as well as geographical and geological features.   6 In 1972, with the help of the airlines and the Aviation Development Council, the school was able to send a group of students to Cape Canaveral for a special tour of the facility and to witness the launching of Apollo 16. THE ANNUAL P.T.A. MEETING AT EASTERN AIRLINES August Martin High Association. One of that has been held at and 300 parents and presentations by the School has been fortunate to have had an outstanding Parent-Teachers the highlights of its annual program has been the general membership meeting Eastern Airlines Terminal, John F. Kennedy Airport. Each year between 250 staff members have met at Eastern Airlines to hold a brief business meeting,hear school's musical groups and listen to a special guest speaker.  The speakers, all of whom have played an important part in helping to launch an sustain August Martin, have included: Paul Gibson, Jr., Vice President of American Airlines and former New York City deputy Mayor; James Plinton, Jr., Vice President of Marketing at Eastern Airlines; and Donald Burns, Assistant Manager for the Port Authority. These memorable evenings have concluded with refreshments and champagne provided by Eastern Airlines. PORT AUTHORITY ACTIVITIES Annually, August Martinites have taken part in the Port Authority's Operation Safety. The students have acted as the ""victims"" in a simulated plane crash staged by the Port Authority at John F. Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. The August Martin Band also provided the music at the Pan American Airways Dedication of the 747 Clipper Lindbergh at its Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration of the Lindbergh Flight on May 20, 1977. USING JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT FACILITIES One of the factors that made the adoption of an aerospace magnet logical and natural at August Martin High School was its closeness to John F. Kennedy Airport. The school has a bus available daily to take classes to the J.F.K. facilities. For example: language classes visit Air France and Iberian Airlines; career education groups are taken to Allied Maintenance, the Pan American Airways shops and the Federal Aviation Administration Air Route Traffic Control Center; and business education classes visit the administrative offices of various airlines. DC-10 DEDICATION On April 10, 1975, the school dedicated its new DC-10 facility and honored those individuals who had been responsible for helping the school secure and install a mock-up of the passenger section of the DC-10 aircraft. Mr. Paul Gibson, Jr. was instrumental in obtaining the facility from the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation in California. The crated sections and equipment were shipped by naval transport through the Panama Canal to the Bayonne Military Terminal. The crated facility was then transported on four flat bed trucks, first to the American Airlines cargo center and then to the school.   7 In order to get the three huge sections into a second-story room, a whole section of wall had to be removed. The borough shops then assembled the entire mock-up, which is complete from the galley facilities down to the carpeting. The mock-up has been used for orientation, meetings and classes. AEROSPACE CAREERS DAY Periodically the school, with the help of its Guidance Department, has organized a Career Day. Students, parents, guests and staff members attend some 25-30 career workshops that are conducted by personnel from the aviation industry. The event generally is followed by a luncheon prepared and served by the teachers and students for the guests and staff. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AWARD In 1973, August Martin High School was the first school to receive the John A. Hanson Award designed ""to acknowledge achievement and to encourage outstanding public service in the field of transportation."" Nominated by the Eastern Region, Federal Aviation Administration, for the coveted ""Department of Transportation ,New York Field Coordination Group Annual Unit Award,"" the school was selected because it had ""become an asset to the community through its innovative and imaginative approach to education"" and had implemented its ""philosophy of 'learning through aviation' ..."" At a banquet held on Governor's Island on Friday, November 30, the presentation was made. STUDENTS STUDY THE EFFECTS OF TOURISM ON THE CARIBBEAN ECOLOGY In 1972 and 1973, with the help of the airlines and Dr. Towle, President of the Island Resources Foundation, groups of students were sent on trips to the Caribbean Islands to study the effects of tourism on that region's ecology. The experience was both recreational and educational. The pupils were given orientation and training sessions, visited mangrove swamps, studied underwater life, visited the botanical gardens and national park, given snorkeling and scuba-diving lessons and taken on plane and boat rides. SPECIAL GUEST AT AUGUST MARTIN HIGH SCHOOL Periodically, notable guests particularly interested in August Martin's aerospace program, have visited the school. On October 13, 1972, the school hosted a group of educators and officials from Washington, D.C., led by Dr. Mervin K. Strickler of the Federal Aviation Administration. The visitors were guests at a special assembly held for the occasion. This assembly featured a talk by Mr. Lloyd Haynes, then star of the television series, ""Room 222,"" and a question-and-answer session. The following Friday evening's ""Room 222"" show was very timely entitled ""Lift, Thrust, and Drag,"" and it dealt with the use of aerospace to motivate students. It also mentioned the Richmond, California experiment and August Martin, the man. On April 24, 1974, Mr. Charles Dobson of the F.A.A. flew five educators from Washington, D.C. to visit the school. On February 10, 1975, a distinguished group of educators from Yale, Clark and Stony Brook Universities, led by noted Yale University psychologist, Professor Seymour Sarason,   8 spent a day at August Martin High School. Representatives from the three universities, who were involved in the ""Project Network,"" adopted August Martin High School as the special inner-urban school for study. This relationship eventually led to August Martin's involvement in the Stony Brook ""Minorities in Engineering Program."" On February 25 and 26, 1975, August Martin, because of its aerospace theme, was selected as the host school for the annual evaluation meeting of the National Advisory Committee involved in the Transportation Curriculum Project for the U.S. Office of Education. Eventually, August Martin staff members also became involved in the national curriculum project. The above are illustrative of the many ways August Martin School has attracted visitors, scholars and resource persons who have taken elements of the program back to their own locale. Also, such visits have helped prompt offers of cooperation from many sources of assistance to the August Martin program.  THE AUGUST MARTIN AEROSPACE CURRICULUM AEROSPACE CURRICULUM MATERIALS This section includes highlights of the various curricular approaches used by August Martin faculty and staff. The material is excerpted from the publication entitled: August Martin High School Program with Special Emphasis on Aerospace Education, Dr. Lawrence Costello, August Martin High School. The areas covered are: English Social Studies Mathematics Foreign Languages Science Music-Art Health Education  Included are curriculum materials developed by the school's department chairmen around the August Martin aerospace theme. It includes a statement of each subject department's aerospace education philosophy, samples of model lessons and instructional materials. The pages represent only a small part of the whole body of aerospace instruction matter that the school has prepared since its opening. Teachers are urged to use the material whenever applicable or relevant to a lesson. It should be noted that certain aerospace courses, such as ""Principles of Flight"" (Science) and ""Air Age"" (Social Studies), are required of all students. Despite the importance of the central theme to the school's program, August Martin High School has found it increasingly advisable to introduce curriculum materials from areas closely related to aerospace, such as science and technology (the August Martin Institute of Science and Technology, or AMIST) and communications (August Martin Communications Center).   9 The following chairmen of academic subject departments have helped to develop the materials found in this section: English Social Studies Mathematics Foreign Languages Science Music-Art Health and Physical Education Noel Kriftcher Natalie Greenberg Steven Feldman Arthur Kesselman Frederick Haines Harold Bacon Samuel La Rocca William Bush Rosemarie Castanza James H. Kearney  THE USE OF THE AEROSPACE THEME IN ENGLISH The aerospace theme in the English/Communications Department is incorporated in an indirect manner. Preparing students for basic competency in communications skills requires a multitude of courses which are tailored to students' interests and abilities. Realizing, however, that many young people have chosen to attend Martin because of its aerospace theme, several references to aviation and its tangible fields have been incorporated within the English curriculum. The following list represents some of the aerospace-related features of English study at August Martin: 1. Vocabulary building lessons which include aviation-oriented words. 2. A communications studio which instructs students in the use and understanding of film, television and radio - the communications media of the air age. 3. Implementation of a Career Bridges and Work Experience Program which places students in aerospace-related external learning situations. 4. Special English course work within the AMIST Program. 5. A course in College and Career Experience which prepares students for standardized examinations which they will be called upon to take during their high school careers. Sample Lesson Plan ""An Irish Airman Foresees His Death"" - Yeats AIM: To learn how the airman views death.   10 MOTIVATION: How many of you have ever seen a plane from World War I? Would you want to fly one? Why? Why did the pilots of WWI go up in those planes? We're going to read a poem in which an airman expresses his feelings about being up in one of these planes. Let's look at the poem together and see if we can determine the pilot's attitude toward this dangerous work. DEVELOPMENT: 1. In the first line, the airman uses the word ""fate."" What does he mean by this? (death) 2. Why does he consider death his fate? What does this tell us about his attitude towards flying? 3. What are the reasons this airman gives for going to war? 4. How does he feel about those he is fighting? How does he feel about those he is guarding? 5. What does the airman mean by the last three lines of the poem? SUMMARY: How does the airman view the possibility of his own death? APPLICATION: If you were a fellow airman of the speaker in this poem, how would you feel about his attitudes toward flying? Those he defends? Those he fights? Would you try to make him change his mind? Why? Why not? Aerospace Theme in Written Communications CYCLE II Course Title: WRITTEN COMMUNICATION II (Effective Expression In The Flight Age)  Mandatory for all pupils, however, each student will be programmed into one of the three courses listed for this cycle. The student will be recommended for the course which best meets his needs based upon an ongoing ten-week evaluation of his weaknesses and strengths in the areas of composition and interpretation of literature. Since students will return to heterogeneous groups for Cycles III and IV, in Cycle II the difference between the courses will be based upon the depth and sophistication with which the material will be approached. All students will study, basically, the same material. English 132 - English Essentials Workshop - for students who need assistance in developing basic writing and interpretive skills. English 122 - Developmental Writing Workshop - for students who need assistance in organizing their ideas in composition writing and in developing their skills in narration, description and persuasion.   11  English 192 - Creative Writing Workshop - for students who need assistance in attempting a wide variety of creative writing activities. Basic Areas of Study: I. Introduction to a Variety of Literary types Through Reading A. Short Story B. Essay C. Poem D. Play E. Biography (and Autobiography) F. Novel G. Account of True Experience II. Vocabulary and Spelling III. Oral and Written Interpretation of Literature A. Flight Age Problems B. Analysis of Written Styles and Techniques IV. Written Communication (Dependent upon the course in which a student is enrolled) A. The Diagnostic Composition (no numerical grade to be issued). For criteria, see Cycle I B. Short Exercises for the Following Skills: 1. The Narrative 2. The Descriptive Passage 3. Supporting an Opinion 4. Persuading a Reader 5. The Character Sketch C. Creative Writing Exercises - short story, poem, essay D. Written Report (based on outside reading of a full-length literary work) NOTE: Readings are to be selected from the required textbook provided for the course (Composition: Models and Exercises). Supplementary readings (short stories, essays, excerpts from longer works) are to be selected by each teacher to provide models for class discussion of writing techniques and communication of ideas. Ongoing in-class discussion based on readings and events are essential to exchange of ideas by students. Such concepts as critical listening (and thinking), and respect for others' points of view are to be taught and emphasized. During Cycle II, the following topics will be studied (based on titles provided by the textbook): 1. 2. 3. 4. Skills of Descriptive Writing Using Sensory Details Skills of Narration Selecting Events   12 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. Using Narrative Details Using Dialogue Point of View Organization In Exposition Description in Exposition Narration in Exposition Supporting An Opinion Persuasion The Character Sketch Sentence Skills a. b. c. d. e. f. Variety in Sentence Lengths Parallel Structure The Compound-Complex Sentence Gerund Phrases Appositives Sentence Skills in Combination  SUPPLEMENTARY READINGS - CYCLE II The poet often witnesses an event and then takes the reader to view the event as though he were watching it through the poet's eyes. This poem helps you to observe a fairly commonplace event, but the last six lines shift away from what you see to what the author feels. SONIC BOOM by John Updike I'm sitting in the living room. When, up above, the Thump of Doom Resounds. Relax. It's sonic boom. The ceiling shudders at the clap, The mirrors tilt, the rafters snap, And Baby wakens from his nap. ""Hush, babe. Some pilot we equip, Giving the speed of sound the slip, Has cracked the air like a penny whip.""

ENGLISH 251 SUPPLEMENTARY READINGS (NUMBER 4)  VOYAGE TO THE MOON by Archibald MacLeish Presence among us Wanderer in our skies, dazzle of silver in our leaves and on our waters silver, O silver evasion in our farthest thought ""the visiting moon"" ... ""the glimpses of the moon"" ... and we have touched you! From the first of time, before the first of time, before the first men tasted time, we thought of you. You were a wonder to us unattainable, a longing past the reach of longing, a light beyond our light, our lives - perhaps a meaning to us ... Now our hands have touched you in your depth of night. Three days and three nights we journeyed, steered by the farthest stars, climbed outward, crossed the invisible tide - rip where the floating dust falls one way or the other in the void between, followed that other down, encountered cold, faced death - unfathomable emptiness ... Then, the fourth day evening, we descended,   14 made fast, set foot at dawn upon your beaches, sifted between our fingers your cold sand. We stand here in the dusk, the cold, the silence ... and here, as at the first of time, we lift our heads. Over us, more beautiful than the moon, a moon, a wonder to us, unattainable, a longing past the reach of longing, a light beyond our light, our lives - perhaps a meaning to us ... O, a meaning! over us on these silent beaches the bright earth, presence among us. THE USE OF THE AEROSPACE THEME IN SOCIAL STUDIES SOCIAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT The Social Studies Program Course of Study for Air Age And Related Subjects Geography and Aviation History of Flight Aviation History Aviation and Space Careers Social, Economic and Political Impact of Flight Aerodynamics Development The Social Studies Program The prime objective of the Social Studies Department is to teach Social Studies. However, there are motivational devices one can use to kindle the flame of knowledge and get the students' attention. August Martin High School has adopted an aerospace thematic approach to achieve this objective. As a means of orienting all incoming students, a special one-cycle (ten weeks) course in the Air Age is made mandatory for all ninth-year students. The course spans the areas from myths and legends to the present-day rocket age. In addition to the history of aviation, the pupils are made aware of the social, political and economic impact of aviation. In other areas throughout the four years at our school, every effort is taken to integrate aviationoriented materials into the regular curriculum. In the study of geography, one not only deals with longitude and latitude, but with great circle routes. Students are made to realize that while on a plane surface a straight line is the shortest distance between two points whereas on a sphere an arc is the most direct way of getting from one place to another. Military Aviation Aviation Categories Rocketry and Space Exploration Lighter-than-air Flight   15  Every effort is made to stress and emphasize materials that lend themselves to our aerospace theme by discussing the great artists of the Renaissance. Copies of Da Vinci's aeronautical drawings are presented and discussed. From the Eighteenth Century on, there is a wealth of material that can be introduced to stimulate students' interest. In addition to the early experiments in lighter-than-air flight, the discussion of the use of balloons in the United States Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War give students insight into the fact that aircraft have been around and used for a long time. Teachers in the Social Studies Department avail themselves of every opportunity to try and present interesting and informative materials that blend in with the school's aerospace theme. This approach not only adds interest to the course of study but, carried out over a four-year period and through all disciplines, generates enthusiasm and curiosity on the part of the student.

It has been claimed that abstractions have not provided meaningful educational experiences for students and often resulted in low interest. To increase motivation for mathematics learning, aerospace has been introduced as thematic material. The wealth of information available and its possibilities for application at all levels of mathematics education make it a well-spring of motivational sources. At August Martin High School, some of the areas of algebra that use aerospace applications include: Arithmetic drill, signed numbers, space, algebraic expressions, operations with signed numbers, verbal problems, functions, ratio and percent, Pythagorean theorem, proportions, similar triangles, trigonometry, literal equations, scientific notations, conic sections, evaluating formulas and logarithms. Aerospace applications in geometry at August Martin High School are included in the following topics: Angle measure, congruent triangles, alternate-interior angles of parallel lines, similar figures, Pythagorean theorem, trigonometry, angle of elevation, angle of depression, longitude and latitude, circumference of circle, area of circle, length of arc, area of rectangle, square, equilateral triangle, regular hexagon, circle, zone, sphere, cylinder and volume of rectangular solid, sphere and cylinder.

If wind direction is considered to be horizontal the angle of attack of an aircraft is the angle between its airfoil (such as its wing) and the wind direction. If this angle is too great the aircraft will not be able to fly. This angle, called the critical angle of attack (or burble point) causes turbulent flow of air and will produce no lift. If the burble point of an airfoil is 42 degrees which is 4 more than twice the angle of attack, what is the angle of attack? 26. A spacecraft is being prepared for launching.

The clockwise angle NYB, between a true north ray from New York and the direction of flight, is called the course of the plane. Find the angle measure of this angle with a protractor to determine the course the pilot would follow.  2. A pilot flying from New York to Washington would follow the direction represented by ray YW. The clockwise angle NYW, as indicated in the diagram, would be the course the plane would follow. Use a protractor to determine his course. The magnetic compass is used to show the direction of flight. There are 360 degrees in the compass circle. North is 0 degrees. East is 90 degrees. South is 180 degrees. West is 270 degrees. Express the following directions in degrees of the compass: 3. Northeast 4. Southeast 5. So uthwest 6. Northwest  Magnetic forces in the earth and in each aircraft affect the magnetic compass. The difference between true north and magnetic north is called variation. Compass error caused by magnetic forces in the aircraft itself is known as deviation. If, for example, a pilot desires to fly a true course of 90 degrees in an area where the variation is +10 degrees and his compass variation is -5 degrees, he must fly a compass heading of 95 degrees to achieve his true course, since 90 + 10 - 5 = 95. Determine the magnetic and compass headings for each of the following flights: True Course 7. 082 deg 8. 274 deg 9. 350 deg Magnetic Heading Compass Heading  Variation -4 degrees +9 degrees +7 degrees  Deviation +2 degrees -5 degrees -4 degrees   31  CONGRUENT TRIANGLES An angle of parallax is the change in direction when a star is viewed from two different points. It may be the angle subtended at the star by the radius of Earth.  For distant stars a heliocentric parallax is used. This is an angle formed by rays from the Sun and Earth.  10. If the heliocentric parallax of a star is 2 degrees on September 1, what will it be on March 1, six month's later? Assume the orbit of Earth about the Sun is circular. ALTERNATE-INTERIOR ANGLES OF PARALLEL LINES Many people claim that Columbus proved that Earth is round. However, a Greek scholar, Eratosthenes, who lived about 200 B.C., which is almost 1700 years before Columbus, did more than that. He found the approximate circumference of Earth. Eratosthenes first selected two places in Egypt to gather his information. One of these places was a well in Syene (now the city of Aswan). The other place was a pyramid in Alexandria. The well in Syene and the pyramid in Alexandria were approximately 500 miles apart. He waited until a certain day of the year when he knew the Sun was directly overhead because he could see its reflection on the bottom of the well. On that same day an observer in Alexandria noted the shadow cast by the pyramid and measured the angle formed by the Sun's ray and the pyramid as approximately 7 degrees 12 feet.   32  11. Assuming the rays of the Sun are parallel, what was Eratosthenes' measure of the circumference of Earth. TRIGONOMETRY A sweeping light beam is used with a light source detector to determine the height of clouds directly above the detector, as illustrated in the diagram.  The light beam sweeps from the horizontal (angle x = 0 degrees) to the vertical (angle x = 90 degrees). When the beam illuminates the base of the clouds directly above the detector, the angle x   33 is read, and with d, the distance between the light source and the light source detector, known, the height of the clouds can be computed. 12. If the light source is 1,000 feet from the light source detector and the light beam is reflected from clouds when angle x = 63 degrees, find the height of the clouds. 13. Find angle x if the clouds are 1,200 feet high and the light source is 900 feet from the light source detector. At many United States National Weather Service stations two light sources are used to gain more reliable data. One light source is 800 feet from the detector and the other light source is 1,600 feet from the detector. 14. If the angle at the 800-foot light source is 51 degrees when a cloud is 1,000 feet high, what is the angle at the 1,600-foot source? THE USE OF THE AEROSPACE THEME IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES FOREIGN LANGUAGES DEPARTMENT Foreign Language Program Samples of Foreign Language Materials  FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROGRAM The supersonic jet and swifter forms of worldwide communications have contracted the globe; consequently the need to communicate with our neighbors abroad has become all the more imperative. our international relations are constantly expanding as we endeavor to build and maintain alliances for securing the peace, to provide technicians and material assistance to underdeveloped countries, to engage in international cooperation in science, technology and business and to promote large-scale cultural exchanges of students, teachers, artists, musicians and leaders in many fields. The importance of acquiring a working knowledge of foreign languages is constantly increasing as our far-flung activities and our destiny grow more and more intertwined with those of other peoples. In foreign languages, each student is permitted to work at his own pace. After a first ""common cycle,"" students are screened and placed into one of the three separate tracks: A ""fast"" track where students will be able to cover the year's work in threecycles; an ""average"" track where four cycles will be needed; and a ""slower moving, more conversational"" track where students will cover the year's work in six cycles. The rewards of such an arrangement are apparent. There is no failure attitude but rather a moving forward constantly at the student's own rate of speed. Success is guaranteed! The use of modular scheduling techniques in class programming will provide the time flexibility for a wider variety of instructional approaches; the teachers and students will be able to engage in skits and dialogue routines and variations; there will be greater time available for the use of the language laboratory; and visual aids will become an integral part of classroom activities.   34  In all foreign language classes at August Martin High School, the students have the opportunity to engage in off-campus laboratory work at airport facilities and will be additionally rewarded via field trips to the world's largest airport where the languages they are studying will ""come alive"" as the youngsters hear and speak with the many people who speak the very languages the Martinites are learning. PERSONAL INTERESTS 1. Vocational In a world where travel by jet plane is a reality, the demand for men and women with training in a foreign language is ever increasing. There is a growing need for government employees, diplomatic and consular representatives, and industrial personnel who are bilingual or who have a working knowledge of two or more languages. American-trained skilled workers with a good foreign language background are always sought by companies involved in business and industrial enterprises in foreign languages. There is a need for engineers, scientists, teachers, bankers, military men, and businessmen who can travel and live abroad. To make them more effective in their work, a knowledge of foreign languages is essential. There is every indication, therefore, that opportunities for employment are greater and more varied for the individual who has mastered a language other than his own. Some fields in which a knowledge of foreign languages is advantageous are: Diplomatic Service Aerospace Medical Technology Careers on Operatic and Concert Stage Import and Export Trade Passenger Servicing Foreign Banking Newspaper and Magazine Editing Museum Work Flight Attendant Teaching of Foreign Languages Scientific Research Avionics Publishing Library Science Airport Vehicle Technician Travel and Tourist Agencies Intelligence and Security Agencies Translating and Interpreting Bilingual Stenography Radio Broadcasting Employment at the United Nations Headquarters or Specialized Agencies 2. Avocational   35 Even when the study of foreign languages is not a requirement for a specific career or job, the ability to understand and speak it may be an asset to any individual. Many personal interests and leisure time pursuits are associated with an appreciation of the language, life and customs of the people whose language is studied. Some avocational activities involving a knowledge of a foreign language are: - travel - speaking the language of the country visited makes the trip more worthwhile - reading literature in its original form - enjoyment of foreign language films, plays, opera, etc. - listening to foreign language broadcasts - communicating with visitors from foreign lands - engaging in ""Pen Pal"" correspondence AIMS OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION General Aims The general aim of instruction in foreign languages is to develop in pupils the skills needed for effective communication in the foreign language. A concomitant aim is to develop in pupils an understanding of the foreign people, of their country and of their culture. Linguistic Aims To understand the foreign language when spoken by a native at normal tempo and on a topic within the pupil's experience. To speak the foreign language on topics within the pupil's experiencewith sufficient clarity to be understood by a native. To read with direct comprehension material within the pupil's experience. To write in the foreign language on topics within the pupil's experience. Cultural Aims To develop an enlightened understanding of the foreign people through a study of their contemporary life, their patterns of behavior and their national customs and observances. To acquire specific knowledge regarding the geography, history, economic life and educational and political institutions of the foreign people. To acquire attitudes conducive to intercultural harmony through a study of the contributions of the foreign people to the development of the United States and of world civilization. To develop cultural and esthetic appreciations through a study of the foreign country's art, music, literature, science and contemporary art forms, such as drama, film, dance and design. To promote growth in the language arts through the development of language consciousness.   36 SAMPLES OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIALS Viaje en avion El avion es un medio rapido de transportacion aerea en nuestros dias.

THE USE OF THE AEROSPACE THEME IN SCIENCE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT The Science Program Sample Science Materials   41  Biology The Science Program  Principles of Flight  Science educators have long held the belief that they hold an advantage over their colleagues in other disciplines because students come to school with an innate interest in science. Youngsters grow up fascinated with the physiology of the human body, space travel, astronomy, life in the oceans and the planet Earth itself. With this inherent pupil interest in mind, the science staff at August Martin High School was ecstatic with the thought of using aerospace as a motivational theme - a golden thread with which to link various topics in the science curriculum. Our view of the motivational theme concept is that it is multifunctional in nature. It serves to: 1. 2. 3. 4. Unify all subject areas within the school. Relate subject matter to potential career opportunities. Enrich the course of study. Heighten pupil interest in education.  Our task was to first provide basic interdisciplinary instruction in aviation or aerospace technology early in the student's high school experience, preferably in the ninth year. This was accomplished through such mandatory courses as ""Principles of Flight,"" ""History of Aviation,"" ""The Air Age"" and ""Aircraft Model Building."" Equipped with this basic knowledge the student, in subsequent grades, could be expected to relate the experiences of an aircraft pilot to a scientific principle. For example, the mechanical process of external respiration can be presented in the classroom within the framework of a pilot's physiology as his aircraft rises from sea level to an altitude of fifteen thousand feet. How does a reduction in atmospheric pressure effect the process of breathing? How does atmospheric pressure at sea level compare with atmospheric pressure at high altitudes? Is sufficient oxygen available at high altitudes to carry out internal respiration? What is the role of oxygen in internal respiration? Can Dreb's Cycle possibly be affected by a deficient oxygen supply at high altitudes? How is blood pressure and pulse rate affected by high altitude flight? The answer to one question suggests another question. Our overall appraisal of the use of aerospace as a motivational theme, wherever possible in science instruction, is that the excitement, glamour and magnetic appeal of this subject has grasped the imagination of the vast majority of our students and has enabled a substantial number to achieve a level of success in strictly academic subjects that had not previously been attained. We heartily endorse and recommend its inclusion in high school programs.   42 Sample Science Materials BIOLOGY Lesson 1 AIM: Physiological Problems in Flight: Respiration  OUTCOMES: 1. As altitude increases the air becomes colder, thinner and lighter. 2. Atmospheric pressure decreases as altitude increases. 3. A partial reduction in the amount of available oxygen can cause serious illness. MOTIVATION: Review the composition of air. (Nitrogen 78%, Oxygen 21%, all other gases 1%). Using models, charts, etc., review the structure and function of the human respiratory system. Ask, ""What force causes air to move from outside the body into the respiratory system?"" DEVELOPMENT 1. Respiration is possible because, at sea level, atmospheric pressure is high enough to drive oxygen through the membranes of the lungs into the blood. Atmospheric pressure is reduced at high altitudes. 2. At altitudes above 10,000 feet the effects of hypoxia (partial lack of oxygen) become increasingly visible. At altitudes of 15,000 to 25,000 feet prolonged exposure to hypoxia results in paralysis, unconsciousness and eventually death. 3. Ask: ""What causes hypoxia at high altitudes? What effect will a reduced supply of oxygen have on the mitochondria in the cells of the body? How will the pilot be affected by a reduction in the number of ATP's produced?"" a. Pulse rate, breathing and blood pressure all increase. b. Sense of touch and pain become dull. c. Vision is seriously impaired. d. Muscular control is decreased. e. Movement is slow and awkward. 4. DANGER: The pilot is in a state of drunkenness and has a feeling of well-being and is quite relaxed. Lesson 2 AIM: Physiological Problems in Flight: The Eye  OUTCOMES: 1. Vision is fundamental to flight.   43 2. Certain vision skills can be improved. 3. Advances in aviation medicine have helped to alleviate some visual problems. MOTIVATION: Ask students: ""Of all the organs in the body which one, if only slightly impaired, would preclude the possibility of flight?"" DEVELOPMENT 1. Using models, charts, etc., review the structure and function of the eye. Define and discuss the following: iris, lens, pupil, retina, optic nerve, rods and cones. 2. Define Depth Perception - ability to judge distances. Since depth perception depends upon learning and experience it can be improved. 3. Night Flying - Review function of rods and cones. a. Night vision depends largely upon rods. b. Strong light has a deleterious effect upon rods and must be avoided. c. Pilots are urged to wear red-lensed goggles 30-40 minutes prior to night flights. These lenses permit cones to see while rods regain full efficiency after exposure to strong light. (Dark Adaptation - process which prepares eyes to see under low illumination.) 4. Discuss the dangers of night flying. a. Tendency to rely on vision rather than instruments. b. Mistaking stars for lights. c. No definite horizon.

Lighter-than-air Gliders Propeller-driven aircraft Jet-powered aircraft Helicopters  2. Different types of aircraft serve the various needs of individuals, business and government. LEARNING ACTIVITIES 1. Exhibit picture and models of various types of aircraft. Have students group the aircraft by their flight principle. 2. Elicit how the various types of aircraft serve different purposes based on their flight principle. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR TEACHERS 1. Lighter-than-air - Weather observations, astronomy, advertising. 2. Gliders - Pleasure flying. 3. Propeller driven aircraft - Transportation, airmail, air express, patrol and survey, crop dusting, wildlife management, forest fire control, aerial photography, prospecting, air rescue, business flying, recreation flight training, military functions. 4. Jet-powered aircraft - Commercial aviation, business flying, military functions. 5. Helicopters - Interairport flights, industrial flying, disaster relief, law enforcement work, airport to city center service. What factors determine the amount of lift a wing will produce? OUTCOMES   46 1. An increase in the relative wind increases lift. Increasing the angle of attack causes a decrease. The pressure on the upper surface of the wing also increases lift. 2. If the angle of attack becomes too great, air moving over the upper surface of the airfoil will break away from the surface and lift will be decreased. 3. When lift is decreased so that it cannot support the weight of the airplane, the airplane is said to be in a ""stall."" LEARNING ACTIVITIES 1. Using the airfoil on the balance from the previous lesson, increase the velocity of air striking the airfoil. 2. Point out the meaning of ""angle of attack;"" slowly increase the angle of attack of the airfoil. Obtain data on the amount of lift in relationship to the angle of attack. 3. By means of diagrams, show what happens to the flow of air if the angle of attack becomes too great. Introduce the term ""stall."" SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR TEACHERS 1. Angle of attack is the angle between the chord of an airfoil and the relative wind. Relative Wind Angle of Attack 2. Other factors that influence the amount of lift force are the design of the airfoil, surface area of airfoil and density of air. What is the Relationship Between Velocity and the Pressure of Fluids? OUTCOMES The pressure in a moving fluid is less when the velocity is high and greater when the velocity is low. LEARNING ACTIVITIES 1. Establish that both gases and fluids are called liquids. 2. Students will do laboratory worksheets. 3. Discuss the applications of Bernoulli's principle in spray devices, passing a large trailer truck in a car, standing near the edge of a subway platform when a train passes. 4. Demonstrate Bernoulli's principle by using a venturi and a manometer.   47  How is an Airplan Controlled in Flight? OUTCOMES 1. The airplane is controlled in flight by the moveable control surfaces. 2. The ailerons control movement about the longitudinal axis. 3. The elevator controls movement about the lateral axis. 4. The rudder controls movement about the vertical axis. 5. The pilot controls these moveable surfaces from the cockpit.  LEARNING ACTIVITIES 1. Point out, by the use of models, the location of the ailerons, elevator and rudder. Demonstrate that they are hinged to the trailing edges of the wind and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. 2. Elicit that a movement of any one of the control surfaces changes the shape of the airfoil it is attached to. 3. Demonstrate, with a wind tunnel and model, various positions of the control surfaces and how the model reacts. 4. Discuss how the pilot uses a stick or wheel and pedals to operate these control surfaces. Point out that, to properly execute a turn, a pilot must use all 3 control surfaces simultaneously. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR TEACHERS 1. The ailerons are so arranged that as one moves up the other automatically moves down. 2. In order to effect a turn, the airplane must be banked as well as pointed in the desired direction, just as highway curves are banked to prevent skids.  THE USE OF THE AEROSPACE THEME IN MUSIC-ART AND HEALTH EDUCATION MUSIC AND ART DEPARTMENT Sample Art Lesson Sample Music Lesson HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   48  Family Living Drug Education Health Music and Art Department Through the development of aerospace, many parts of the world have become easily reachable within shorter periods of time. As a result, the people of the world have become closer, and there is a constant interchange of culture and ideas. Music and art can be considered universal languages with a similar purpose - bringing the people of the world together and developing a better understanding of each other's cultures. By taking an imaginary flight, we can land in different countries and study the music and art which are a part of the heritage in each place, thereby instilling a sense of appreciation for the cultures and backgrounds of different people. For example, through the years, many composers and artists have expressed their nationalistic feelings through their works. Smetana's ""The Moldau,"" Grieg's ""Norwegian Dances,"" Respighi's ""Fountains of Rome,"" Villa Lobos' ""Train to Caipira,"" Sibelius' ""Finlandia,"" and Tschaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" are some of the musical works which can be used to give some insight to people's political and social conditions as they travel through the countries. Goya's ""Disasters of War,"" Picasso's ""Guernica,"" Daumier's ""Uprising"" and Diego Rivera's ""Murals"" are examples of art works which can be studied as part of a unit on imaginary travels to study the cultures of the world. Folk music and folk art are a journey through different studied through their songs lives, such as tragedy, war, other areas to be incorporated into the music and art curriculum. Taking countries, the conditions of the people as reflected by the layman can be and art works. These works have been inspired by many events in their romance and occupations.  From the performance level, or ""active"" involvement of the students, many songs and works of art can be created using aerospace as a means of motivation to develop skills and discover talents. For the vocal and instrumental classes, songs such as""Up, Up and Away,"" ""2001 Space Odyssey,"" ""Fly, Robin, Fly,"" ""Fly Me to the Moon,"" ""Lucky Lindy,"" and ""Star Wars"" can be taught. The school song, ""Upward Bound,"" is based on the theme of aerospace. In art, aerospace is an excellent theme. Aircraft, missiles and space vehicles are popular subjects for painting, crafts and sculpture classes. Issues that surround the aerospace community are appropriate subjects for painting, cartooning and advertising design classes. Noise pollution, aircraft mishaps, baggage mishandling and traffic jams are excellent aerospace themes available for exploration in the art class. In ceramics, it is possible to create aerospace-oriented ash trays, dishes and pottery. In fashion design classes, clothing of airline personnel can be studied. The architecture and interior design of airplanes and buildings at airports are other aerospace subjects to be studied by the students. They can study what has been created by artists already, as well as create new ideas of their own.   49 SAMPLE LESSON:ART AIM 1. To relate art to everyday activities. 2. To develop a specific skill by learning to render distance in a realistic manner through one-point perspective. 3. To use buildings and runways at an airport as a means of teaching perspective. MOTIVATION 1. Show slides of buildings drawn in perspective by the artist Utrillo. 2. Show pictures of buildings drawn in perspective by architectural draftsmen. 3. Demonstrate the process on the blackboard. METHOD The class is instructed to draw a complex of buildings and runways as imagined by them at an airport. Give students 15 minutes for the creative work. Then spend five minutes making comments and showing them samples of what is being done by others. Then permit students to complete their work. MATERIALS Rulers, pencils, erasers and white paper. SUMMARY Evaluate the student works at random. Why are some works successful in showing one-point perspective? Why did some students fail to show this perspective? Does a building or runway look realistic if it is out of perspective? Why? SAMPLE LESSON: MUSIC As part of a unit which involves an imaginary flight around the world to study the different musical cultures, we arrive in Russia. AIM 1. To show how national traditions have enriched musical literature. 2. To reveal certain characteristics which are typical of Russian music. MOTIVATION   50 1. Give the historical background which inspired Tchaikovsky to write this music. Discuss the war between France and Russia and how the French were defeated primarily by the Russian winter. ""1812"" is Tchaikovsky's gesture of homage to his homeland. METHOD 1. Teach the Russian and French national anthems. When they can recognize the melodies, they will be able to hear how Tchaikovsky used them in the Overture. 2. Discuss the sequence of events which are depicted in the music and the themes used for each. For example, the Chorale in the beginning is like a prayer in time of need. Then a military theme is used to symbolize the Russian army. At the end, there is a blaze of glory represented by the bells and cannons. 3. Play the recording, asking students to raise hands as they recognize different themes and anthems discussed. MATERIAL 1. Recording of the ""1812 Overture"" by Tchaikovsky 2. Rexograph sheets with main themes written SUMMARY 1. How did Tchaikovsky represent both the French and Russian in the music? 2. What effects in orchestration did he use to create the feelings of need? of strife? of victory? 3. What melodic and rhythmic idioms did he use? 4. Which musical characteristics seem typical of Russian music? 5. What are some of the reasons for a composer to write nationalistic music? Health and Physical Education Department The fields of Health and Physical Education are perhaps the more difficult curriculum areas in which we may effectively utilize the aerospace motivational theme. If the premise is correct, use of the aerospace theme should prove effective in stimulating the student to put forth a greater effort in the active educational process. In Physical Education, we have utilized the Canadian Royal Air Force exercise program with success. We have also begun use of the Air Force Aerobic jogging/running program to improve the cardio-respiratory endurance of our student body.   51 Initial screening of our incoming freshmen and sophomores has revealed a particular weakness in general fitness levels. A primary cause of this poor general fitness level is our growing cultural aversion to daily exercise. Our students are a valid reflection of this general social malady. To motivate them to want to improve their general fitness level, we embarked upon the aforementioned fitness programs. In the area of Health, we have also incorporated the aerospace theme in our lesson development whenever feasible. Several topic areas have been effectively explored as valid aerospace theme topics. For example, the areas of jet lag, drug abuse (and the causative agent - stress), environmental education (the effect of noise pollution, as in the case of the SST), and social adjustment (divorce among the members of aviation occupations) are several of the areas in which we have achieved success with the aerospace motivational theme. SAMPLE LESSON: HEALTH - FAMILY LIVING I. Topic: Divorce among the aviation occupations. II. Aim: Why do airline pilots and air traffic controllers have such a high divorce rate? III. Objective: To have students learn the problems that are inherent in the aeronautic occupations and what they might do to better the situation. IV. Motivation: Captain's salary - $70,000, Air Traffic Controller's salary - $38,000. Why aren't these individuals who have all this money per annum able to be happy and live a stable life? V. Pivotal Questions: 1. How might we define divorce? 2. What problems lead to divorce? 3. How can a certain occupation affect the stability of a marriage? 4. How might traveling constantly affect a marriage? 5. How might we prevent or cut down on the high divorce rate among aeronautic occupations? (Suggestions) VI. Reasons for Divorce 1. Shift work and the marriage. 2. Traveling and the marriage. 3. Why would you become a pilot if you were married? VII. Homework 1. What are the requirements in order to become a pilot? flight attendant? air traffic controller? etc. 2. What are the benefits of working in the aeronautics field? 3. Would you think going into an aviation occupation worth the possibility of getting a divorce?   52  4. How might open communication and trust fit into a successful marriage? 5. What else is important in a stable marriage? Information from The Family, J. Ross Eshlemian Human Sexuality, J.L. McCarey LESSON - HEALTH - DRUG EDUCATION I.

Since its inception, the aviation program has been enormously successful, attracting students from all over the city. Currently the curriculum provides the students with a basic education in the theory and the practical aspects of flight. Starting in the freshman year, the students are given the Aerospace Workshop in which they build model planes while learning the basic principles of flight and what actually makes a plane fly. In addition to the above, classes are offered in Flight Theory and flying lessons at Republic Airport. State University of New York (SUNY) at Farmingdale provides the practical component of the program. Our flight students log an average of 8 hours flying time per year and become quite proficient in take-offs, landings and flight maneuvers. The course culminates with the written portion of the FAA private pilot's examination. Approximately 100 students per year take advantage of our flying program. One basic requirement is that a student must be passing in all his/her subjects or he cannot go flying. The actual flying takes place at Republic Airport where our students fly under the tutelage of FAA certified flight instructors. All our students keep an official log book and their flying time is credited toward earning their private pilots license, if they choose to pursue that route after graduation. We are quite proud of the accomplishments of our students. Some have earned scholarships to Tuskegee, where they participated in a two week workshop of intensive flight training and classroom activities. Some of our graduates have gone on to study aviation at Florida Institute of Technology, Embry-Riddle, Dowling, the Academy of Aeronautics and SUNY Farmingdale. Over the years, we have won many first and second prizes in the yearly ""Fly-In"" citywide competition among the high schools, and many of our graduates have gone on to pursue careers in engineering, business and the aviation industry including, FAA and American Airlines. After the ninth grade our students take courses in Technical Drawing, Aerodesign, Computer Aided Drafting and Design (C.A.D.D.) and Communications Systems. Our C.A.D.D. labs are under constant improvement to provide more computer work stations for more of our students. Within the past year, the number of work stations we support has doubled and some units have been upgraded. In addition, the software has been upgraded to the latest version. The Communications System Lab is a new offering. At present the curriculum is being adapted for our student population including a bilingual component. The communications system course   55 requires a significant amount of hands-on activities along with reading, writing and math skills. As a result we are using an interdisciplinary approach in conjunction with the English Department to implement the curriculum. One project will be an individual writing assignment for each student which will be done in the English class and typeset, printed and produced in a booklet in the shop. (This information on recent additions to August Martin High School options was provided by Mrs. Leslie Gurka, Principal.) Clearly, the August Martin program gives eloquent testimony to the practical value of using a pervasive theme around which to build an educational program. Aerospace, in this instance, is a means to educational ends. Obviously, other themes can be used successfully. For example, following the early success of the August Martin program, a Marine Science High School - Beach Channel School - was developed using the environment of the local water-marine influence on Long Island. The key point to consider is that an aerospace or other thematic approach to education is feasible. Moreover, the behavior changing impact of such programs yield remarkable benefits for the students as well as the total community. Any school system that feels there is an opportunity and need to design either a part of an aerospace oriented program or a portion of it, will do well to look at the experiences gained in planning and operating August Martin Comprehensive High School. While not all of the community, industry, and motivational factors that combined to make the August Martin program successful exist everywhere, clearly the Richmond, California experiment (cited in the Aerospace Magnet Schools - Past - Present - Future section of this publication) proves that much can be done with few resources if the initiative, motivation, and determination are present.   56 SECTION VI - HISTORIC AVIATION HIGH SCHOOL In Long Island City, New York the oldest high school in the nation with a continuous program of educating high school students as Aviation Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) operates successfully today as it has since its inception in 1936. Aviation High School has served as a model for other secondary schools. Some of them have adopted parts of the approach used in New York and a few plan for similar comprehensive totally aviation maintenance oriented programs. The South Mountain Aerospace Technology Program in Phoenix, Arizona and the Shawnee High School program in Jefferson County Public School District in Louisville, Kentucky plan parts of their offerings to include aviation maintenance technology. The largest similar program currently being planned is the Castlemont Aviation High School program in the Oakland, California Unified School District. For any community planning a predominantly aviation maintenance technician-oriented high school aviation program it would be well to consult the schools noted above. The current Aviation High School brochure describes their program as follows: GLOSSARY Aviation Maintenance - The application of mechanic's skills necessary to maintain and repair aircraft. Avionics - Electronics as it pertains to aircraft systems. Airframe - The study of the structure of aircraft and all its systems. FAA - (Federal Aviation Administration) is the governing agency which issues all Airframe and Powerplant licenses. FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is the governing agency which issues the Avionics license. Powerplant - The study of aircraft engines and all their systems.
