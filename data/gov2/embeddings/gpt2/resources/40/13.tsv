It's important to reserve the equipment well in advance. Be sure to             right down the confirmation number when making reservations over the             phone.               Most rental packages require a             deposit. Many companies now allow customers to start the rental             reservation process on line. Still it's best to call the company and             inquire about equipment availability.

This is a time to explore yourself. Principles             and traditions that are important to you. An opportunity to express             the depth of your love and trust in your husband to be.                             Your wedding takes on special meaning when you surround yourself             with your most precious relationships. Besides the husband to be             you'll want to keep close contact with family and best friends.             Remember that you cannot please everyone. What's most important is             who this most honored occasion is for, the uniting of Bride and             Groom as husband and wife.                             Brides Maids and Groomsmen                            When putting together your choice of brides maids and groomsmen you             may wish your wedding party could be twice it's size. Fear not,             there is way to go about the selection while giving              others  a major part in the wedding program.  Choosing Wedding Party                               So Many Friends and Relatives!                The longer the list the higher the expense.

Your budget is important because it is next to impossible to know what you can afford for each major part of the wedding if you don set an overall cost that is comfortable for you. You will probably find that deciding the budget is the hardest job to do because, of course, you want to have the best and most memorable wedding you can possibly have. The days when the wedding was paid for by the parents of the bride are almost gone now. Parents will often contribute to the wedding cost as a gift to the couple, but it is pretty rare for parents to cover the whole cost of the wedding. Usually this is because the parents simply can afford it. But couples today often prefer to pay for their own weddings because it ensures that they can plan them the way that they want to without interference. These days, 4 out of 5 couples pay for their own wedding and it helps to know how your budget should be broken down. When creating your budget, you will first begin with the overall amount that you can afford to spend. The average wedding today costs approximately $19,000. This is not a definite, but this is what the statistics currently show. Now you will need to take that overall budget amount and split it percentage-wise for each major aspect of your wedding e.g. how much to spend on the wedding clothing, the rings, catering, decorating the venue etc. If you are not good at percentages, you can always utilize the Internet and check with the various websites that offer you free or cheap wedding budget calculators that will do it for you. With these calculators, all that you have to do is input the total budget amount and then they will calculate for you how much money in dollars you will be able to spend on each component of your wedding. Once you have figured out the dollar amount that you can spend on each component of the wedding, you can then begin to create a list itemizing everything. You will need to put together a list of all the areas of your wedding that are important to you and make sure that you allocate a sensible proportion of the total budget to each. This is necessary so that you can see if the wedding of your dreams is a realistic expectation given what you can afford to spend. If you come up short, here are some ideas to enable you to trim the expenses: Reduce the size of the guest list Forego some of the services Reduce the size of the wedding party Forget the extras like limos It is only by setting down on paper a budget you can afford and listing all of the areas that you have to spend money on that you can begin to refine your ideas on the type and scope of wedding that it is realistic for you to aim for. Afterall, you will have plenty of expenses to cover after the wedding when starting out on your married life together. It just doesn make sense to create problems by over-stretching financially on the wedding.

clueweb09-enwp03-21-19882	"                     Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Whose Wedding Is It Anyway )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?  is an American  reality TV  show on the  Style Network . Season 1 began in 2003, Tuesdays, 10 p.m. [ 1 ]  Each episode runs 60 minutes [ 2 ]  and follows two different couples who plan their  weddings  in different states and sometimes a destination wedding in a foreign country.   Each episode begins with the  bride  and  groom  meeting the wedding planner to discuss theme and what plans might already have been made. The episode then chronicles the wedding planner at work, coordinating the details of the pre-wedding festivities, including rehearsal, the actual wedding, and the  reception . Each  affianced  couple have unique requests, from flowers, invitations, placecards, the cake, the wedding venue, and the reception.   While the brides are followed to bridal boutiques to pick out the perfect  wedding dress , some select two dresses, one for the wedding and one for the reception, to honor special cultural  wedding traditions and customs , or simply for a different reception look. The wedding planners help couples, including  same-sex couples , explore and celebrate their individuality and personal style, as well as addressing difficult family circumstances.   Voice-over  narrators have included  Shari Albert  and  Masasa Moyo .   Those couples featured on the show usually receive a few nights paid accommodation at a resort or hotel as a wedding gift from the Style Network. Couples can apply on-line for consideration. The Web site also provides a list of wedding planners and budget tips.     [ edit ]   References       ^   ""Here Comes the Bride"" . washingtonpost.com.

Making Your             Wedding A Most Memorable Occasion                            The key to making your wedding meaningful and memorable is all in             the planning itself. This is a time to explore yourself. Principles             and traditions that are important to you. An opportunity to express             the depth of your love and trust in your husband to be.                             Your wedding takes on special meaning when you surround yourself             with your most precious relationships. Besides the husband to be             you'll want to keep close contact with family and best friends.             Remember that you cannot please everyone. What's most important is             who this most honored occasion is for, the uniting of Bride and             Groom as husband and wife.

Fear not,             there is way to go about the selection while giving              others  a major part in the wedding program.

Thing No. 1   You will go over budget but you might as well have one.  Show us somebody who doesn’t go over budget on their wedding and we’ll show you someone who can eat just one Lays potato chip.  We don’t claim to be www.theknot.com but we know a few things to get you prepped for this undertaking and the first is that you need to decide how much you and your loved ones are prepared to spend on this ordeal.  The average couple – well, let’s call a spade a spade – the average bride (a white spade) spends almost $30,000 on a wedding these days.  This always seems slightly odd to us since those same average couples go on to struggle for years to put together a down payment for their first home.    It generally breaks down as follows:   Catering        40%   Reception Facility    03%   Florist            08%  Music            10%   Gown/Tuxes        14%   Photography        07%   Invitations        04%   Gifts            04%  Transportation        02%  Misc.            08%    There are a multitude of wedding budget calculators available out there including www.theweddingchannel.com       Thing No. 2    The more discriminating you are about whom you invite, the more your costs will come down.  There are a variety of ways to reduce costs but the fastest way is to reduce your guest list.  That average cost of $30K is based on an average of about 150 guests.  Most people pay close $80- $100 for every mouth they feed at these things so make sure you want to buy Aunt Dixie’s BFF a $100 dinner before you let Dix whine you into putting her on the guest list.  Don’t assume everyone gets a “plus one.""      Thing No. 3   You’re going to want a checklist.  The big items that you’ll need to have a wedding are a date, (do be flexible and plan well in advance) a location (ceremony and reception) and a guest list.  Beyond that, checklists are also widely available but here’s a handy list of things to which you should give some thought to help you start budgeting:  •    Gown  o    Hair/Makeup  o    Preparation Room  o    Pre-Wedding Pampering  •    Attendants  •    Minister  •    Florist  o    Ceremony decorations  o    Bridal bouquet  o    Bridesmaids bouquet  o    Boutonnieres  o    Corsages  o    Reception centerpieces/decorations  •    Invitations/Save-the-Date  •    Cake  •    Menu   •    Music  o    Ceremony  o    Cocktail  o    Reception  •    Photographer/Videographer  o    Prints  •    Tuxes/Groom Accessories  •    Attendant Gifts  •    Parent Gifts  •    Favors  •    Rehearsal Dinner  •    Programs  •    Rings  •    Tips (limo drivers/caterers/photographers)  •    Wedding Night Accommodations      Thing No. 4   Go down the list in Thing No. 3 and slash costs.  Location/Date – go off-season – Saturday nights in June are not a good idea.  A Monday night on the beach in January is a great idea.  Perhaps you can settle on something in between.  A single location for ceremony and reception will save money.    Time – Brunch/late afternoon is cheaper than dinner especially since people booze a little less.    Flowers – Go in-season – tulips in September doesn’t work.  Also, if you or someone you know has a special knack, by all means buy the flowers and arrange them yourself.  The florist cost is in the labor.  Fill up on the greens and be judicious about the blooms.  Be creative with centerpieces – sea shells, candles, rocks, even fishbowls have all been done with much aplomb.      Invitations – Go Green.  Minimal paper is the key and only the real old-school does engraved anymore.  Even if you want that look, it is more cost-effectively achieved with thermography, It’s really more fabulous to just design and print something snappy.  Maybe www.evite.com is pushing it (although it is green!) but even if you’re not feeling snappy, you can download lovely DIY templates at  myjeanm.com   and  thepapermillstore.com   If you really want to be green, do without the save-the-date and the program. You can also skip the reply card – provide an email address to which guests can reply and maybe a regular address for Granny – let her use her own stationery and stamp.    Cake – this is an oldie but a goodie – fake bottom tiers.  We guarantee you have been fooled by this ruse before and never knew it.  Have the baker make a small cake that will serve as the top tier which, you will cut into.  The trick is, after the bride and groom cuts the cake and all that hoopla ensues, it is whisked away to the kitchen where the staff cuts into a big ole’ sheet cake and serves to the unsuspecting guests.  Some people don’t even bother with the ruse – apparently in the interest of full disclosure they simply have a small decorative cake on display and the real sheet cake for eating is in the kitchen.  The youngsters are skipping the cake altogether and serving cupcakes (much cheaper).  In any case, cut desert from the menu – the cake is plenty.    Do us all a favor and skip the favors – nobody really wants these tschotchkes nor do we need to be reminded of where we are and why on napkins, matchbooks etc.    Photography – Try to buy the negatives not the prints and get the prints developed on your own.  Ask a friend to videotape.  Ask an even better friend to edit.      Thing No. 5    All the old, charming rules are indeed old and no longer charming.  Unless the bride is being delivered to the groom along with a certain amount of livestock, don’t assume that all the old customs about who pays for what still hold.  In this day and age most couples foot at least half the bill for their weddings and if you’re over 35 – unless your parents are the Trumps or the Hiltons – you really should pay for the whole thing.  (Feel free to accept a lavish gift however.) Attendants usually pick up the cost for their own clothing and out-of-town guests generally pay their own expenses.  (Again, Trumps and Hiltons exempted.)       Thing No. 6   Bargain shop for that gown.  We know this whole wedding gown thing is a deep, psychological issue with the ability to turn an otherwise sensible woman into someone resembling Lil’ Bo Peep whining “it’s my day!” for weeks on end.  There are so many ways to get a wedding gown (and bridesmaid dresses) for a fraction of the full retail cost, it’s beyond irrational to dump a fortune into this article that will be worn for 6 hours.

Miscellaneous expenses may include your marriage                 license, blood tests, officiant's fees, gratuities, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Percentage Estimated costs  for $20,000  budget Estimated costs for $24,000 budget Reception 49% $9,800 $11,760 Photography 10% $2,000 $2,400 Flowers 8% $1,600 $1,920 Bride's gown  (Including Accessories) 7% $1,400 $1,680 Videography 6%    $1,200 $1,440 Music 6% $1,200 $1,440 Wedding bands 4% $800 $960 Invitations 2% $400 $480 Transportation 2% $400 $480 Groom's attire (Including Accessories) 1% $200 $240 Miscellaneous 5% $1,000 $1,200 TOTALS 100% $20,000 $24,000                                                                                                                                                        Now remember, these are just  estimated                costs and percentages. Perhaps you may spend more in one area and               less in another area. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate               some of these expenses.                                                                                                                                                                  For example, you may be wearing your       mother's               wedding dress . This will eliminate, or at least reduce, the               estimated cost of your bridal gown. The wedding dress of your dreams may be more than your               budget allows. If that is the case, ask yourself where your               priorities are. Would you rather spend more on your wedding dress               and less on your photographs?                                                                                                                                                                    Another way to reduce costs is               to use  flowers that are in season on your wedding day . Obviously               if you use flowers that are not in season, it is going to cost you               more. Cutting corners in one expense can               save you in another. These are just a few examples. You can decide               what is best for your budget. Be flexible, if you spend more in               one expense, reapportion it to another expense.                                                                                                                                                                  Creating a budget with your fiance will probably               save you a lot of headaches. Being realistic about costs and               actually seeing the numbers written down on paper will help you               from spending out of control.

And though theyll likely cost a good chunk of change, they dont have to break the bank.  After you, your fianc, and your respective parents agree to a set budget, youll need to take a few extra steps to make sure you dont blow it when pushy sales persons and pricy wedding amenities come your way. Toa void a total breakdown and bankruptcy, consider the following:                                 Be reasonable.                                 While planning, youre going to come across the crme de la crme of wedding options. But these luxury upgrades can run you somewhere in the thousands, and place you well over budget. When looking at wedding invitations, ask yourself if you really need letterpress or if the thermographic (more budget friendly) option is just as nice looking. If at every turn youre wanting top notch wedding dcor and arrangements, check your budget and assess how many of these number one options are realistically feasible.                  As much as the wedding is about you, your fianc and your big day, be sure to put extra money into things that both you and your guests (and your parents) can enjoy, like music or food. Or, consider saving some extra dough to splurge on your honeymoon.                                         Compromise                                      Youre going to want certain things in the wedding that your fianc may not and vice versa. Being flexible and compromising about where and how much money you should spend; it will encourage you and your fianc to share in making your dream wedding together, rather than competing over two individual visions for the big day.                                     Be realistic.                                    Wanting a dream wedding and creating a realistic budget are often irreconcilable tasks. Its no secret that the budget is the most challenging aspect of wedding planning. With money being one of the top causes for divorces in America, it wouldnt come as a surprise if it was also the cause of many a never-to-be weddings; when the budget gets tight or blown way out of proportion, fights may ensue, leaving a sour taste in both of your mouths regarding planning the rest of the wedding. To avoid premarital divorce (if there is such a thing) consider the following tips about making a budget and sticking to it.                  Stay firm with your Guest List.                                      Though its tempting to squeeze in an extra person here and there, the truth is people equal money. With the average cost per head totaling up to somewhere between $50-100 a head, forgoing your headcount to make room for those suddenly extra friendly family members and acquaintances will likely blow your budget for people you wont even remember being there when all is said and done. Was it worth it? Probably not. Make sure and only invite people who mean a lot to you now and who you know will mean a lot to you in the future (think at least five years or so).                                     Also, when it comes to inviting guests who have been casually dating someone you may not be acquainted with, dont feel pressured to invite them. Simply address the invitation in your guests name only and dont create a space for them to respond +1. Should inquiring minds want to know if they can bring their fling of the month, politely tell them that its simply either that its not in your budget or that youre trying to keep the guest list down to the closest most important people in your life.                                     Manage Your Money Wisely                                    Rather than arguing over whose account wedding finances are coming out of, consider opening a joint wedding account. Decide on an amount of money both of you will contribute to the account monthly, and record and save all receipts related to wedding purchases as your wedding planning unfolds. That way, planning becomes a team effort in every respect and you can work as a team to keep each other accountable for expenses you may make individually.                                    If youve been saving up money in CDs, stocks, or other short-term loans, consider pulling a set percentage to contribute to the budget. Anything you dont spend put back in your respective investment accounts after the wedding.                                     When paying for wedding expenses try and use a credit card that has rewards and benefits like air miles, cash back rewards, etc. You can then put this free money towards your honeymoon expenses or use it as a cushion when trying to get back on track after the wedding splurge mayhem subsides. Also, consider adding family members, like parents, to the card so you can benefit from their financial contributions as well.                                     Find the Hidden Costs                                    Want a cake but didnt plan on having to pay a $3-4 per head cake cutting fee? Want tray                   passed hors de oeuvres but didnt plan on having to pay extra hourly wages for the wait staff? Did you remember that youll have to tip the wait staff, and the DJ, and the wedding planner, and all the other people who may have helped on the big day and will be waiting for the handout at the end of festivities? All these hidden costs significantly dent the budget, so be sure and factor them in beforehand so you stay realistic when deciding between Gerbera Daisies and Slipper Orchids (sure, most brides will want the latter, but with all these unforeseen costs, can you still afford them)? And when budgeting for invitations, dont forget to calculate postage costs for both invitations (which may cost more based on weight and shape) and of course, the response cards.                                     Get Crafty                                    Rather than relying on wedding vendors to supply you with everything overpriced, consider doing some of the decorative work yourself. Not only will it make the wedding more personal, and all the more special because of it, it will also save you tons of money. From linens to flowers to centerpieces, getting creative and crafty and opting to make these things yourself could save you thousands of dollars.  And, when you get compliments on how beautiful everything looks, youll feel all the more gratified. Lastly, dont be afraid to get the family and wedding parties, particularly the bridesmaids, involved.                                     Plan for a Planner                                    Though it may seem initially counter intuitive, hiring a wedding planner can actually save you money in the long run if youre smart about how you use them, which should be as your number one resource. Wedding planners plan weddings for a living. Consequently, they know all the ins and outs about weddings, budget dos and donts, and when and where and how to best spend your money. In short, theyll be the best resource you have in trying to make your dream wedding a reality on your humble budget.                                      Leave Cushion Room for Overages                                    No matter how careful you are, youll probably go over your budget, unless, that is, you try and account for overages with a cushion account. The typical budget overages for a wedding is somewhere around %5-10.                                    These overages sneak up by way of unforeseen costs such as tipping vendors, last minute flower and/or dcor changes; weather precautionary expenses (such as renting a canopy tent for rain or heaters for the cold); last minute oops like wedding gown stains or cufflinks for the grooms suit; and of course, all those little things you often forget to account for in your budget, such as the guest book pin, sashes for the bridesmaids, those extra rounds of cocktails youll buy family and friends at the rehearsal dinner, that extra hour youll order the night of the reception&                                     Plan on encountering some of these overages yourself and set some money aside in an emergency fund; that way, when fate or circumstance rears its ugly head, youre already covered.                                     Find a System and Use It                                    Whether youre going to use an online wedding budgeter or buy a wedding planning book and use the resources allocated in it, plan on using any, all, or some of these free resources to your advantage. Were a fan of electronic wedding budgeters because they not only break up budgets by typical expense percentages (e.g. you should spend x% on your gown, y% on your food, z% on your venue&you get the point), but as you make purchases the budgeter will instantly reflect the new percentage breakdown and available budget finances. If an online system isnt for you, consider a spreadsheet, like Microsoft Excel.

You might consider an elegant ice sculpture for your reception or balloons to lend an air of festivity. Party supply stores can provide you with a wide assortment of decorations for your reception and your bridal shower. If you're considering an outdoor wedding, one call to a well-established party rental company will assure you that all of your needs can be met. From tents, dance floors, chairs, tables, linens, even a gazebo...if you want it, you can probably rent it! But be sure to get all of the details in writing: the costs, the quantity and size of each item, and the times for delivery, setup, and knockdown. And be sure to ask for references.

Try shopping at a consignment store or renting your wedding dress. Also look for used dresses in the classifieds or college bulletin board.        Looking to cut back on some reception expenses? Use a small decorative cake for the cutting and then use inexpensive sheet cake to serve your    guests.                                     Home  |  About  |  Advertise With Us  |  Contact                Temple Marriage  |  Articles & Advice  |  Wedding Planning Checklists  |  Bridal Showers  |  Honeymoon  |  Now What?

Enjoy an Organized Holiday This Year                                  1. Keep a stack of directions TO your place for people who need to know how to get to your home or office. This prevents you from having to write them out every time you are asked. Type the directions and save them on your computer. This way you can email, fax, or mail them the directions. Make copies and keep them accessible. It is also helpful to keep directions FROM your place for future visits you need to make. 2. Rather than add to someone else's clutter with a gift you are not sure they would like, give 'consumable' items for Christmas such as: special coffees or teas, cookies, or gift certificates. 3.      Keep a Christmas idea file. Keep a folder and insert recipes, magazine clippings, gift ideas, and other ideas you might like to use for the holiday. 4. A COUNTDOWN is super effective for any event such as weddings, holidays, and parties. Start by creating a master to-do list of everything that needs to be done for your special event. Then, transfer a couple of to-dos onto each day preceding your event. Cross off items when finished! 5. AVOID shopping during busy times like the weekend and after-work. Shop online, by catalog, or in an area with several stores-in order to consolidate your shopping trips. Ask for gift-wrapping! 6. Spend your time on what you LOVE to do. If you love socializing, why waste your time cooking? Order from your favorite restaurant. If you hate decorating, hire an interior decorator or an art student. Exchange tasks with friends. 7. Pack your decorations away with care. Do not throw everything in a box. Take time to pack fragile items carefully. Store your decorations and lights in proper containers. Inventory what you have with a list and a list for what you need next year. LABEL all of your boxes!

After all, dad is the pillar of the family unit, the one who made us feel safe, loved to tickle and tease, and above all gave us a sense of security.                              Christmas Mourning         Deecember is a cruel month. Christmas sales, decorations, advertisements -everyone seems so happy and cheerful - it's easy to feel alone.                              Samanthas Bay Leaf Ritual for the New Year         HI would like to share with you a ritual I do every New Year's that is quite involved and requires a lot of thought and meditation time. It is derived from an ancient Greek ritual for prosperity and fertility.                              Mother's Day Crafts         Make these quick and easy crafts with your children for Mother's day.

Surviving Those Holiday Blues         Not everyone shares in the celebration and joy associated with the holidays. Many people feel stressed and unhappy in response to the demands of shopping for gifts, spending large amounts of money, attending parties and family gatherings, and entertaining houseguests.                              Valentine Gifts From The Heart         One of my fondest childhood memories is of my mother helping me make a Valentine's box to take to school. We pulled out white paste, an old shoebox, scraps of doilies, and construction paper.                              How Parents Can Win the Battle To Keep Your Child Safe From Strangers This Holiday Season         When we think of Holiday shopping, we think of all the glowing lights at our area malls and the various eye-catching decorations in shopping centers. Along with distractions with our 'to do' list in our heads, we get preoccupied with carrying bags and scoping out gifts.                              Event Planning 101         One of the tools I use as a professional organizer are countdowns.What exactly is a countdown? To put it simply, anytime a special event, party, or holiday is anticipated (okay maybe dreaded :), create a MASTER list of EVERYTHING you need to do.                              Maybe This Christmas Will Be Different....         Have you always dreamed of a Norman Rockwell Christmas - where everyone is singing Christmas carols and there is joy in the house? Alas, your Christmas memories are often filled with Uncle Joe getting drunk and your parents ending up in a fight. By the end of Christmas day family members are mad and no one is talking to one another.                              Dear Santa: Christmas Sucks!         Christmas time is finally here, and most people during this holiday are happier than a fat kid eating a Krispy Kreme donut. Christmas brings so many great things to the table; the caroling, the NO SCHOOL, the snowmen and hour long snowball fights that ends with bloody noses, the eggnog and drunken relatives, the presents, holiday parties, and the drinking hot coco next to a roaring fire while cuddling up with your loved one.                              Taking Back Christmas         John Grisham wrote a book called SKIPPING CHRISTMAS.  Amazon.                              Jewelry Christmas Gifts That Sparkle and Shine         The joyous season of Christmas is steeped in tradition, and gift giving is one ritual that is inseparable from this holiday. Who hasn't had difficulty at one time or another in choosing a suitable present for a beloved family member or a dear friend? Fortunately, jewelry Christmas gifts are widely available and there is an endless variety of styles from which to choose.                              Saint Nick to Santa, the MOST extreme makeover?         It's the holiday season, and the first thing that comes to so many minds is presents, and who better to deliver these presents than Jolly Saint Nick himself. Chris Cringle, Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus, etc.                              Ready to Skip This Holiday?  Why No Just Make It Your Own?         Do you feel panicked, or exicted?  Are you experiencing joy or depression?  Do you have childlike visions of toys and celebration with the people you love?  Or pressure, loneliness, alienation and annoying relatives?Sometimes we really can't help but ask ""What is celebration?  Do we really need it?""I can tell you there were times after my divorce and my daughter's death that I asked myself those questions.  My kids had moved out.                              Choosing A Great Gift For A Polar Bear Lover         Do you know someone who is absolutely crazy about polar bears?   Choosing a polar bear gift for a friend or loved one can be a lot of fun because there are so many choices out there, and luckily the price range is wide enough so that anyone can choose a great polar bear gift.Of course, sometimes having a lot of choices can be a problem, too.                              Halloween Safety Tips         Halloween is an exciting night for children and a busy time for their parents.  With such excitement, it's easy for children to forget basic safety rules.                              Celebrating the ME in MumME         Another Mother's Day is upon us.  A day in which our loved ones bestow us with handmade gifts, breakfast in bed, supper out and sometimes even jewelry!!!  It is a day for our family to show how much they appreciate the job we do.                              The Origins of  Mothers Day         Most people mistakenly believe that Mother's Day is an invention of the greeting card manufacturers and flower shops - a cynical ploy to make the nation spend millions of dollars each year on greetings cards and flowers.  However, the roots of the holiday are more elevated than this and go back much further, right back to the times of the ancient Greeks and Romans.                                                                             website translator       home  |  site map   Powered By:  Free Work At Home Business Opportunity!         © 2006            "

Over the years our DJs have played at just about every possible type of function imaginable. Therefore gaining experience in knowing what makes people get off their seats and onto the dance floor, coupled with the correct attitude, attire and courtesy to the client, making our DJs completely professionals. The process of booking a mobile DJ can be a difficult one as there are so many factors involved with making the right choice for your function.    The main things to consider are experience and reliability.   There are lots of things you need to find about when booking a mobile DJ for your function. Here are a few things we can tell you about us:       Experience - We have over 20 years in supplying DJs. All of our DJs are experienced in running many different events, be it a wedding reception, dinner/dance or birthday party and understand how to make yours run smoothly.       Ability to read dance floors and change music accordingly. There's nothing worse than a DJ playing music for half an hour that no one is dancing to. Equipment - Appropriate for your venue. There's absolutely no point in having enough equipment to fill a stadium if you are arranging an intimate dinner/dance for 50-100 guests. This would look out of place and be very intimidating for guests. On the other hand if you do have a bigger function, we would come with enough sound and lighting equipment to fill the venue with distortion free sound and effective lighting.  Music -  We can play almost any style of music you wish, but we do know generally what gets people on the dance floor and moving. When you book one of our DJs we will always ask for any styles that are required and most of the time customers will leave it up to the DJ to play a selection appropriate for the guests at the function. This is where the ability to read a dance floor comes into play. All DJs come prepared with a selection of music second to none, starting with music from the 1940s and carrying on right through 50s, rock 'n' roll, Motown and 60s, 70s glam, disco and soul, through to the 80s, and then up to date with top dance floor fillers, R&B, and all those top cheesy pop tunes if you want those.   We do not supply the kind of DJ who wont play a song because it will ruin his street credibility or is not 'cool' enough. If we think it is appropriate and people will enjoy it or dance to it, then we will play it.   Your DJ will also play requests as long as he thinks they will fit in with the style of the party.       Attitude -  We have listened to the opinions of lots of clients over the years who have been to different functions and one thing that stuck in our minds was the attitude of some DJs. Some who don't understand or want to understand the clients needs in regards to music. Perhaps playing the wrong kind of music at the wrong volume or even being rude to guests at the party or function. This is usually what occurs when you get an inexperienced DJ. There is no need for this. Any reasonable request can be adhered to.  In summary your dj will be:   Experienced  Polite  Helpful  Friendly  Reliable  Dressed appropriately  Willing to play requests  Able to read the dance floor  Able to play music from 1940s to the current charts  Playing music at the right volume for you and your guests  Able to use a microphone in the correct manner   In addition to DJ Services we can provide: Special Effect Lighting, Event Coordination, Event Promotion & Website Ranking and Design.
