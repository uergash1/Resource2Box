The Chesapeake Bay Trust was created as a nonprofit organization by the General Assembly in 1985 (Chapter 789, Acts of 1985). The Trust's mandate is to promote public awareness and participation in restoring and protecting the water quality and the aquatic and land resources of Chesapeake Bay.   To accomplish its mission, the Trust seeks contributions from the business community and private citizens which it distributes to groups undertaking projects to help the Bay. Grant recipients are nonprofit organizations, civic and community groups, schools, and local public agencies that have conducted stream cleanups, tree and marsh grass plantings, erosion control projects, water quality studies, and habitat restorations. The Trust also has supported enhancement of environmental education centers and development of educational materials to inform people of all ages about the Bay.   In addition to grants from businesses and private citizens, the Trust receives the proceeds from sales of the commemorative Chesapeake Bay license plate. Voluntary donations to the Chesapeake Bay and Endangered Species Fund, via the tax check-off on the Maryland State income tax return (line 37), also support the Trust. The tax check-off, created in 1989, enables Marylanders to contribute for Bay cleanup and programs that aid endangered species.   Although established as an instrumentality of the State, the Trust operates with independent financial and policy-making status. It is not subject to the legislative appropriation process and receives no public tax dollars.    The Trust is governed by a nineteen-member Board of Trustees. The Governor appoints fourteen of its members to four-year terms. Five members serve ex officio (Code Natural Resources Article, secs. 8-1901 through 8-1910).

The grant will be used by the Schuylkill         County Conservation District and the Pocono Northeast         RC&D to construct diversion wells at four sites in         Schuylkill and Dauphin counties. The wells will reduce         acid loading to Swatara Creek by 1,000 pounds per day and         iron and aluminum concentrations by as much as 25         percent. Depending on site limitations, aeration/settling         ponds and small wetlands will be constructed. Water         chemistry and aquatic life will be monitored to evaluate         the success of the diversion wells. (June 6, 1996)                         Site Navigation

RIDGE ANNOUNCES FIRST BROWNFIELD INVENTORY GRANTS    Governor details PA’s land recycling successes during NGA meeting in St. Louis    Ridge says nearly 500 old industrial sites now ""recycled"" in PA      ST. LOUIS (Aug. 8)  – Calling it a critical step forward    in identifying old and abandoned industrial sites in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom    Ridge today announced $1.5 million in grants to 32 communities across the state    to inventory brownfield properties in their region.    Gov. Ridge made the announcement as part of his presentation on    Pennsylvania’s nationally recognized Land Recycling Program during the National    Governor’s Association (NGA) Annual Meeting in St. Louis.        ""One of the most critical issues facing us today is how we    develop our land,"" Gov. Ridge told the NGA’s Committee on Natural Resources.    ""Our brownfield and environmental initiatives will leave a more lasting    and worthwhile legacy to the Pennsylvanians of tomorrow.""        The Brownfields Inventory Grants are the latest tool introduced    under Pennsylvania’s Land Recycling Program. The grants provide $50,000 to municipalities    and economic development agencies to inventory and promote their brownfields    properties.        ""These old industrial sites used to be a burden for communities    – eyesores, locked up behind fences and avoided,"" Gov. Ridge said. ""That    picture has changed after four years of our successful Land Recycling Program.    Nearly 500 sites have been put back to productive use and through these new    grants, communities will be able to promote even more brownfields sites as assets    for redevelopment.""         Under the program, if the properties are available for redevelopment,    the grantee will gather information about the property and post it in the Pennsylvania    Brownfields Directory available on the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental    Protection (DEP) website.        ""This brownfield database will be the foundation of Pennsylvania’s    smart growth planning as we work to blend environmental and business progress    with the preservation of all of our precious resources,"" Gov. Ridge said.        Gov. Ridge signed Pennsylvania’s Land Recycling Program into law    in 1995.        ""I can proudly report that almost 1,000 sites have submitted    their clean-up plans, with more than 475 sites completed and more than 15,000    people working on cleaned up sites,"" Gov. Ridge said.        ""With the help of the Land Recycling Program, Pennsylvania’s    communities are banding together to take back the reins of their economy. They    are now empowered to transform useless locations into vital centers of commerce.    And they have filled empty spaces of desolation with bustling centers of activity.    It’s the beginning of a new trend – a trend we in Pennsylvania are proud to    tout!""        In 1997, the Ford Foundation and the John F. Kennedy School of    Government at Harvard University selected Pennsylvania’s Land Recycling Program    – from among 1,540 competitors – for a ""Top 10 Innovations in Government""    award. The Council of State Governments selected the program as its 1997 Innovations    Award winner; and the American Legislative Exchange Council adopted the program    as the national model for industrial site recycling.        NGA is the nation’s bipartisan national governor’s association.    Its members are the governors of all fifty states, the commonwealths of the    Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico and the territories of American Samoa,    Guam and the Virgin Islands.         Each year, NGA the annual meeting allows both Democratic and Republican    Governors to discuss common state problems, solutions and to help shape and    implement national policy.

Ridge    today are:        Adams County: Adams County Office of Planning & Development;    Allegheny County: Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh;    Southwestern Pennsylvania Corporation; West-to-West Coalition;        Bedford County: Bedford County Development Association;        Berks County: County of Berks;        Blair County: Southern Alleghenies Planning and Development Commission; Altoona-    Blair County Development Corp.;        Bucks County: Redevelopment Authority of Bucks County;        Butler County: Community Development Corporation;        Cambria County: Cambria County Redevelopment Authority; Johnstown Redevelopment    Authority;        Cameron County: County of Cameron;        Chester County: Chester County Development Council;        Clearfield County: Clearfield County Industrial Development Authority; City    of DuBois Redevelopment Authority;        Columbia County: Columbia Alliance for Economic Growth Inc.;        Cumberland, Dauphin and Perry counties: Capital Region Economic Development    Corporation;        Elk, McKean and Potter Counties: North Central Pennsylvania Regional Planning    and Development Commission;        Erie County: Economic Development Corporation of Erie County;        Greene County: Greene County Industrial Development Authority;        Jefferson County: Jefferson County;        Lancaster County: County of Lancaster;        Lawrence County: City of New Castle;        Lehigh County: Lehigh Valley Land Recycling Project of Phoenix Land Recycling    Co.;        Luzerne County: County of Luzerne;        McKean County: City of Bradford Office of Economic and Community Development;        Montgomery County: Redevelopment Authority;        Philadelphia County: City of Philadelphia;        Somerset County: Somerset County Economic Development Council;        Susquehanna County: Department of Economic Development; and        York County: York County Economic Development Corporation.

Seif today announced the award of nearly $750,000 in construction contracts to restore five abandoned mine sites in Clearfield, Fayette, Greene and Washington counties.    ""Pennsylvania's 200-year mining history has left us with 250,000 acres of abandoned mine land. Restoration of these five sites will eliminate hazardous conditions and ease the environmental debt created by early mining practices,"" Seif said.     The projects are funded either by the federal Abandoned Mine Land Grant Program or the state Bond Forfeiture Program, both of which DEP administers. The federal funds come from a tax on each ton of coal produced. The state program is funded through bonds forfeited to the state by mine operators who failed to reclaim the lands they have mined. Mine operators are required to purchase bonds before they receive their mining permits.    The Clearfield County contract went to Saupp's Excavating & General Contracting of Smithmill. The $79,074 project includes water line improvements, installation of two fire hydrants and replacement of a road in Beccaria Township.    Two contracts were awarded in Fayette County: a $101,077 contract to the Gralan Corporation of West Fort Ann, New York to grade and seed 31.5 acres in North Union Township; and a $95,874 contract went to Utilities Forestry Services Inc. of Clearfield to grade and seed 31.5 acres in Saltlick Township.    Both sites were abandoned by the Hopwood Construction Co.    M. Lawrence Franty t/a Franty and Sons of Pittsburgh received the Greene County contract. The $249,400 project involves the removal of two bridges and a building and sealing 10 deep mine portals at a site abandoned by the Shannopin Mining Co. in Dunkard Township.    Casselman Enterprises Inc. received the $162,012 Washington County contract to grade and seed 30 acres in Somerset Township. The site was abandoned by the Penn Sherman Corporation.

Most (about 80%) of the county is located in the piedmont plateau with gently rolling hills. The remaining 20% is in the coastal plain region with flat sandy soils. Within its beautiful valleys are located many   thoroughbred horse farms  . It is the third largest county in the State.        Baltimore County was formed by 1659. At that time it was made up more than one quarter of present-day Maryland and included parts of (or all of) today's Harford Co., Cecil Co., Frederick Co. & Carroll Co. The original county seat was at Spesutia Island, located in Joppa Town. In 1768, the county seat was moved to Baltimore Town. When Baltimore was incorporated as a city, the county seat was moved to its present location in Towson. Since 1851 Baltimore City and Baltimore County have been    two completely separate entities.        The county was named for the proprietor's Irish home, and today it is the home of the state's leading wine and horse industries.

Each schedule requested the following information: name of the veteran (or if he did not survive, the names of both the widow and her deceased husband): the veteran's rank, company, regiment or vessel, date of enlistment, date of discharge, and length of service in years, months, and days; post office and address of each person listed; disability incurred by the veteran; and remarks necessary to a complete statement of his term of service. Practically all of the schedules for the states Alabama through Kansas and approximately half of those for Kentucky appear to have been destroyed, possibly by fire, before the transfer of the remaining schedules to the National Archives in 1943.

GX268-90-8613704	"Prepared by: The Connecticut Department Of Social Services Elderly Services Division 25 Sigourney Street Hartford, CT 06106  Patricia A. Wilson-Coker Commissioner  May 2000   TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Housing Contracts Housing Definitions Financial-Assistance Programs Home Care Programs Important Facts About The Directory Housing Communities By Region Southwestern Connecticut South Central Connecticut Eastern Connecticut North Central Connecticut Western Connecticut 1 17 39 66 102 i ii iv xi xvi xx  Appendices Connecticut's Planning Service Areas State Unit on Aging and Area Agencies on Aging Regional Offices of the Long Term Care Ombudsmen Adult Home Share Programs   INTRODUCTION Older adults and their families routinely request information from the Elderly Services Division of the Department of Social Services (DSS) about elderly housing options in Connecticut. Securing the most appropriate housing in relation to peoples' needs is typically a challenge. The Elderly Services Division prepared this directory to help elderly consumers and their families select appropriate living environments and identify where they are located. This directory provides a list of communities by housing type and municipality. It also describes different housing options and outlines various programs that can help elders live independently and stay in their communities. These programs provide both financial assistance and supportive services. As older individuals age, their living arrangements and availability of supportive services become increasingly important considerations. Elderly individuals and their families should take the necessary time to research sufficiently available housing environments and to prepare adequately for a move to a new residence. Individuals contemplating changes in residency, together with those advising them, should devote considerable thought to their current and future needs. A careful analysis of these needs should be made before a crisis develops. Too often people delay making housing decisions until their health deteriorates to the point where they cannot safely stay alone, and their families cannot adequately care for them. Postponing these decisions until a crisis develops often reduces individuals' housing options. Persons who are no longer ambulatory or who have certain health conditions may be restricted in the types of housing communities they can enter. Some communities may have the necessary supportive services, but they may only be available to individuals who already reside in the communities. Communities may require that residents be able to maintain themselves in their units and may not directly admit residents to units that provide care. In addition, individuals may select communities that do not have immediate openings and may have long waiting lists for admission. Making choices under the time constraints and emotional stresses that are typically associated with emergency situations can force individuals into making hasty decision that may not lead to the best alternatives. Older persons and their family members should begin learning about elderly housing options and supportive services before there is an actual need for such services. The more knowledge elderly individuals and their families have when making housing decisions the greater the likelihood that they will choose a community that is the most appropriate for their current and future needs and lifestyles. Individuals who consider changing residency are frequently interested in specific areas of the State; therefore, a regional directory was prepared for each of Connecticut's five planning and service areas (PSAs). PSAs divide the state into five regions; namely, Southwestern, South Central, Eastern, North Central and Western. PSAs are mandated by the Older Americans Act and are used by the   Elderly Services Division to coordinate services for the state's elderly citizens. A map of Connecticut illustrating these areas is shown in Appendix I. The Elderly Services Division attempted to prepare a directory that was as comprehensive and accurate as possible. In this effort the Division utilized multiple sources of data. The Division asked the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA) and the Connecticut offices of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Rural Housing Service (RHS) for lists of their elderly housing properties. The Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) supplied a list of elderly housing communities associated with the Housing for Elderly Persons program and the Congregate Housing For The Elderly program. Connecticut Independent Congregates (CIC) provided names of congregate communities that are members of their organization. Lists of nursing homes and residential care homes were obtained from the Department of Public Health's most recent annual report Nursing Home Facilities Licensed by the State of Connecticut 1999-2000. Names of assisted living services agencies and managed residential communities were also gathered from the Department of Public Health's records. The Elderly Services Division also surveyed public housing authorities, various management companies and each municipality's social service department to identify current lists of their age-restricted communities. In addition, the Division investigated real estate sections of local newspapers and advertisements in magazines specializing in aging issues to ascertain names of elderly housing communities. Persons using this directory should understand that the housing designations assigned to particular housing complexes were not always identified by staff members who represented the communities. Some sources the Division relied upon for developing the directory not only supplied names of elderly housing communities, but they also categorized them by housing type. Furthermore, the Division used some discretion in grouping housing communities. If staff members associated with any of the communities listed in this directory wish to make changes to data related to their properties, they should notify the Elderly Services Division (see Appendix II). Likewise, the Division would appreciate being notified of any available communities that are not listed in the directory so that it can better inform elderly consumers of their full range of housing options.   HOUSING CONTRACTS Elderly individuals may be required to enter into different types of contracts depending upon the living environment in which they wish to gain admission. Prospective residents of most age-restricted communities are offered one type of contract; a few, however, are offered a choice. For instance, some communities offer prospective residents the option of buying or renting units. Persons who live in age-restricted communities generally enter into rental, ownership or continuing-care contracts. Nursing homes, on the other hand, require prospective residents or their guardians to sign admission agreements. Rental Contract: Rental contracts usually require leases to be signed between unit owners and residents. Leases can be on a monthly, yearly or multi-yearly basis. These agreements give residents the right to occupy living units for a charge; this charge is commonly referred to as rent and is generally paid monthly. Leases typically outline issues that include: a description of the property being rented, the length of time the resident is allowed to live in the unit, the names of the resident and housing provider, the amount of required rent and other fees, the date rent is due and any late charge requirements in cases when rent is not paid on time, housing management's rules and regulations, resident's rights and responsibilities, identification of who is responsible for maintenance chores related to the unit and building, provisions of utility services and the amount of security deposit, if any. Before signing leases, residents should carefully review them. Residents should not rely upon management's oral promises regarding services and housing policies. Residents generally enter into rental contracts when they reside in certain retirement communities, residential care homes, assisted living communities, congregate housing and communities designated, in this directory, as independent living. Ownership Contract: Ownership agreements require that residents purchase their living units. Residents sign purchase and sales agreements and deeds that give them ownership of their homes or living units. Residents are usually responsible for the maintenance of their units and are typically able to remodel them as they desire. Unit owners generally pay their own property taxes and are responsible for selling their units when they move. Owners of units may gain or lose some of their investment depending upon the market value of their units when sold. Individuals who hold ownership agreements usually live in condominiums, mobile home parks or planned communities with single-family homes. Continuing-Care Contract: Any person wishing to reserve a living unit or reside in one of Connecticut's continuing-care retirement communities must enter into a continuing-care contract. Providers cannot offer or enter into such contracts without being   registered with the Connecticut Department of Social Services. Continuing-care contracts may also be referred to as residency agreements. The contract represents the continuing care provider's long-term commitment to the resident. It is a legally binding agreement between the resident and continuing-care provider that stipulates the specific duties, obligations, rights and privileges of both the continuing care community and the resident. It identifies the amount of the entrance fee and monthly fees. It also specifies whether an entrance fee refund is available and, if so, the term of the refund. This agreement is the resident's guarantee that the continuing care provider will furnish lifetime housing and access to health-related services in exchange for an entrance fee and monthly fees. Prospective residents should take the time to review carefully the details of this agreement, preferably with a retirement counselor or attorney, before signing it. Admission Agreement: Prospective nursing home residents or their guardians must sign admission agreements upon entering nursing facilities. These agreements can also be called financial agreements, entrance contracts or admission contracts. They are legal agreements between nursing homes and residents that specify the conditions under which residents are accepted into nursing homes. They stipulate the services that are provided as well as the costs residents must pay. These agreements cannot require, as a condition of admission, any request for advance payment or deposit from individuals who rely upon Medicare or Medicaid to cover the costs of their nursing home care. Medicare beneficiaries may be requested to pay coinsurance amounts and other charges for which such beneficiaries are liable. Nursing homes are required to inform residents of their right to Medicare or Medicaid coverage and to assist them in obtaining this coverage. Upon admission, residents should be given the Patients' Bill of Rights which identifies the rights individuals are entitled to when they live in nursing homes. Before any person signs an admission agreement, he or she should fully understand it and obtain the advice of a lawyer or Long-Term-Care Ombudsman (see Appendix III) if anything is unclear.   HOUSING DEFINITIONS Although there may be some overlap in the services provided in different housing environments, there are some distinct differences. Housing environments may differ regarding the services they are required to provide as well as the services they are prohibited to offer. In addition to providing different types of services, housing communities can offer varying degrees of the same service. Housing communities can also vary in terms of: 1) the residents they serve, 2) whether they are required to be licensed to operate, 3) their conditions for requiring when residents must move to another level of care and 4) costs. Assisted Living: An assisted living designation in this directory is reserved for managed residential communities that provide supportive services to residents with an entity that is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Public Health as an Assisted Living Services Agency (ALSA). A managed residential community may hold a license as an ALSA, or it may provide supportive services through a contract with a licensed, assisted-living provider. The managed residential community and the ALSA each have specific responsibilities that are mandated by Connecticut statute. Residential communities must provide core services that include laundry, transportation and housekeeping services, meals, recreational activities and maintenance, including chore services for routine domestic tasks. Communities are also responsible for installing emergency call systems in every unit, employing a resident services coordinator, providing 24-hour security and having on-site washers and dryers. The ALSA provides residents with assistance with daily activities, nursing services and medication supervision. It is also responsible for staffing a registered nurse that is on call 24 hours per day and ensuring that the managed residential community provides the required core services. The ALSA does not usually provide skilled medical services. Residents of assisted living communities may be independent or may have chronic and stable conditions as determined by a physician or health care practitioner. These conditions are not limited to medical and physical ailments, but may also include chronic and stable mental health and cognitive conditions. Staff associated with assisted living communities monitor residents, develop individualized service plans and are available 24 hours per day to meet residents' unscheduled needs. Residents typically live in apartment-style units and pay monthly fees. Additional fees may be charged for extra services. Individuals should understand that the ALSA license pertains to the provision of services in a managed residential community; it does not pertain to the housing community itself.   Condominium: Residents who live in condominiums generally own specific living units within a particular condominium structure. Unit owners usually jointly own the land on which the housing structures are located and the common areas. Common areas typically include: exterior walls, parking areas, walkways, halls and stairways, elevators, outside grounds, basements, and in some cases, recreational areas such as swimming pools and tennis courts. Living units can be free-standing homes, townhouses, garden apartments or apartments in highrise buildings. Residents are responsible for paying the mortgages and property taxes on their units. Condominium communities govern themselves by unit owner's associations. The main function of these associations is to pay for repairs, maintenance and taxes of common areas. Each association elects a governing body, typically a board of directors, to manage and establish rules for the community's property. Residents usually pay monthly fees to the association, in addition to their mortgages, for the upkeep of common areas. Condominium communities in this directory are age restricted; they are listed under the section entitled ""retirement community.""  Congregate: Congregate housing provides residents private living arrangements with moderate supportive services and common areas for dining, socialization and other activities. These communities furnish at least one daily meal, which is usually included in the monthly fee, housekeeping services and a variety of social and recreational activities. They are generally meant for individuals who are basically self-sufficient but need a few services to help them to live independently. Congregate housing does not generally offer in-unit assistance or health care services. Individuals who must be supervised, who require the provision of three meals per day or who need daily assistance or extensive services are usually not candidates for congregate housing. Congregate communities may have a resident services coordinator on staff to help residents arrange for services that are not provided by the housing community. To be considered a congregate site in this directory, the community must minimally provide one meal per day in a communal setting, housekeeping services and 24hour security. Congregate Housing For The Elderly: Some of Connecticut's congregate communities are publicly sponsored and are associated with the State's Congregate Housing For The Elderly program. This program mandates that communities provide specific services and that residents meet certain eligibility criteria. Connecticut regulations require that communities provide residents with individual apartments that have private kitchens and private baths. They must provide one main meal per day in a communal dining area, housekeeping services and 24-hour security. Arrangements may be made by housing staff to help residents access personal care and transportation services. These communities do not provide rehabilitation services, nursing   services or supervision of the administration or monitoring of medications. Residents must be at least 62 years of age, have incomes no greater than 80 percent of their area's median income, have temporary difficulties with one or more daily activities and meet the established criteria of a local selection committee that is approved by the Department of Economic and Community Development. There is no asset limitation for this program. Income residents receive from their assets, however, is included in gross income and, therefore, considered when determining rent. Residents are required to pay rent and a congregate services fee. Certain deductions for personal expenses, food and medical costs are used to calculate these charges. Residents may receive subsidies for one or both of these fees. Communities in this directory that are associated with the Congregate Housing For The Elderly program are listed under the congregate housing section and are identified by ""state congregate"" next to their names. For more information call the Audit and Asset Management Division of the Department of Economic and Community Development at (860) 270-8190.  Continuing-Care Retirement Community (CCRC): Continuing-care retirement communities (CCRCs) are also sometimes referred to as life-care communities. These communities are designed and operated to assure residents, through contractual agreements, lifetime living accommodations and a wide variety of services, including a specified package of long-term health and nursing services. Each resident must enter into a contract with a continuing care provider in order to obtain residency. These contracts are often referred to as residency agreements. A resident's entry into such an agreement requires the payment of an entrance fee. The residency agreement guarantees that the continuing care provider will supply housing and access to health-related services for the life of the resident in exchange for an entrance fee and monthly fees. CCRCs offer various types of care, which enable residents to remain on campus and move from one level of care to another as their needs change. Prospective residents must be able to maintain themselves in their apartments at the time of admission and are usually asked to complete a health screen as part of the admission process. Prospective residents must also supply the continuing care provider with personal financial statements that show their ability to meet the community's fee obligations. Connecticut's CCRCs are not licensed but they must adhere to certain statutory requirements (Chapter 319hh of the Connecticut General Statutes, Management of Continuing-Care Facilities). Various components of their health care packages such as assisted living services, residential-care and nursing-home beds, however, are licensed by the Department of Public Health. Housing units can be apartments in high-rise or low-rise buildings, townhouses, garden apartments, cottages or free-standing homes. Units can range in size from studios to three bedrooms. Fees residents pay vary depending upon the community, the type of living unit chosen and whether an individual or couple is the occupant. Continuing-care communities   have different policies regarding the availability and terms of entrance-fee refunds. Residents do not have equity interest in their units. Cooperative: Cooperatives are associations that own and operate housing communities for the benefit of their occupants. Associations may be incorporated and may be for profit or non-profit. Each resident owns shares in the cooperative corporation, which in turn owns all the living units and common spaces associated with the community. Shareholders are required to cooperate in ownership and management. Declarations, or corporate charters, determine how the cooperative will be operated. It also stipulates limits on the use and occupancy of individual units as well as rules for governing common areas. Residents lease apartments from the cooperative corporation; only individuals who own shares in the cooperative are allowed to lease units. Cooperative leases grant residents the right to occupy units. They do not create a landlord tenant relationship between the cooperative and resident, and they do not stipulate rent. Residents are instead required to pay maintenance charges that are set annually by a board of directors. Leases may hold residents responsible for assessments and non-routine expenses. Residents do not carry mortgages and, as shareholders, are responsible for the debts of the cooperative. Cooperatives may decide with whom they wish to share ownership as long as they do not violate existing fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination. Residents who wish to move are required to sell their shares in the cooperative to buyers who must acquire approval from the board of directors. Similar approvals are also required for subleasing units. Cooperatives are listed under the retirement section of this directory. Independent Living: Communities designated in this directory as independent living are rental housing communities that are age restricted. Some communities may allow occupancy to younger persons with disabilities. Individuals typically gain residency in these communities by entering into rental contracts, or leases, for fixed periods of time. Living units are usually apartments that can vary in size. These communities generally do not have the range of amenities found in many upscale retirement communities. Services, amenities, house rules and occupancy requirements vary by community and are influenced by housing managers' decisions as well as by federal, state and/or local laws and policies. These communities are not licensed, but they must comply with building and safety codes regarding the design, construction and safety features of their buildings. Publicly-assisted housing communities may be mandated to conform to additional requirements that are not required in the private market. These communities are generally meant for individuals whose health and physical mobility enable them to live independently with minimal assistance. Supportive services may be used by residents to maintain independent lifestyles; however, residents or their family members may be responsible for acquiring such services. Some communities   may employ resident services coordinators who can enhance residents' abilities to live independently by helping them access community-based services. Manufactured/Mobile Home: Manufactured homes can refer to mobile homes or prefabricated houses that are manufactured off site. Prefabricated houses can be transported to housing sites as one unit or in separate sections and completed on site. After being placed on lots, some mobile homes are configured with peaked roofs and ""skirts"" to give them a permanent appearance. Most mobile homes are located in mobile home parks. Residents of these parks usually own their homes and site them on lots they rent from park owners. Because these homes are usually not moved after they are sited, individuals may have the choice of buying new homes or alreadysited, used homes. Residents must maintain their homes while park owners generally maintain the grounds, pay property taxes on lots, make site-specific improvements and provide common facilities such as laundry and recreational areas. Connecticut's mobile home parks are licensed by the Department of Consumer Protection. They must conform to requirements of the State Building Code, Fire Safety Code and local ordinances or zoning regulations. Every park must have a caretaker in charge at all times to keep the park and its facilities and equipment clean, orderly and in sanitary condition. Each resident must receive a written rental agreement from the park owner before a home or lot can be offered. Park owners are not allowed to charge residents entrance fees. Manufactured homes are usually less expensive per square foot than housing that is built completely on site. The quality of these homes have increased since federal housing requirements have mandated compliance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. These standards specify how strong, durable, fire and wind resistant and energy efficient a home should be. Notwithstanding these requirements, the cost of casualty insurance may be higher for manufactured homes than for homes built on site. Manufactured homes may be restricted from residential districts because of local zoning ordinances. Communities comprised of manufactured homes in this directory are age restricted. Nursing Home: There are two types of nursing facilities that are licensed by the Connecticut Department of Public Health: chronic and convalescent nursing homes and rest homes with nursing supervision. Nursing homes can elect to be licensed in one or both of these categories. Before entering nursing homes, prospective residents or their guardians must sign admission agreements. Nursing homes provide residents with nursing care, meals, recreational activities, help with daily living and protective supervision. Residents live in private or semi-private rooms. They usually have physical or mental impairments that keep them from living   independently. Unlike many other communities, nursing homes employ medical and nursing personnel to provide health care to residents. Some facilities provide sub-acute care, which is medically more sophisticated than traditional nursing home care. Nursing homes can usually provide this care at a lower cost than hospitals. The costs associated with residing in a nursing home vary by facility. The options residents have for paying for their care may include private resources, long-term-care insurance, Medicaid, Medicare or Medicare Supplemental Insurance. Many nursing homes accept Medicare and/or Medicaid as payment. Along with meeting stringent standards, Medicare-approved facilities agree to participate in the Medicare program and limit the rates they charge Medicarereimbursed residents. Nursing homes can elect to qualify all of their beds for Medicare reimbursement or allocate only some beds for this purpose. NonMedicare beds can be charged rates above the Medicare limit. Long-Term-Care Ombudsmen help protect the health, safety, welfare and rights of individuals residing in nursing homes. Ombudsmen receive and attempt to resolve complaints made by or on behalf of residents against nursing homes. The Ombudsmen may also refer complaints related to residents' care to the Department of Public Health. Individuals wishing to make complaints or receive clarification on residents' rights, should contact the regional Ombudsman office in their area (see Appendix III). Ombudsmen and their support staff respect the privacy and confidentiality of persons making complaints or requesting information. Rest Homes With Nursing Supervision: Rest homes with nursing supervision are for individuals with chronic conditions who are unable to live independently but do not need constant skilled nursing care. These individuals typically have controlled and/or stable chronic conditions that require minimal skilled-nursing services, nursing supervision or assistance with personal care on a daily basis. Residents are normally not confined to a bed and usually have a greater degree of mobility than those individuals who reside in chronic and convalescent nursing homes. Nursing supervision under medical direction is provided 24 hours per day. A full range of medical, social, recreational and supportive services are provided. Chronic And Convalescent Nursing Home: Chronic and convalescent nursing homes are designed for individuals who need continuous skilled-nursing services and/or nursing supervision; these individuals have uncontrolled and/or unstable and/or chronic conditions. Individuals can also have chronic conditions that require substantial daily assistance with personal care. Skilled-nursing care is provided under medical supervision and direction to carry out non-surgical treatment and dietary procedures for chronic diseases or convalescent stages of acute diseases or injuries. Residents of these facilities need nursing care, but they do not require hospitalization.   Residential-Care Home: Connecticut's residential-care homes are licensed by the Department of Public Health. Residents of these communities do not require the extensive medical care offered in a nursing home. Residents may require some assistance with daily activities, special diets and supervision of medications. Residential-care homes provide a communal living environment. Residents live in private or semi-private rooms and use lavatories and bathing areas that can be private or shared. Residents pay monthly fees that vary by the community and by the type of room that is chosen. Some communities may allow residents to use government assistance to help pay for their care. Owners of some of the smaller homes often provide services to residents with the assistance of other staff, which helps contribute to a home-like atmosphere and family environment. State law requires that residential-care homes provide three meals per day, housekeeping and laundry services, recreational activities, 24-hour supervision and that there is a mechanism in place for residents to obtain help in emergencies. Staff members can supervise medications that residents selfadminister and may help residents schedule their doctors' appointments. These communities are not licensed to provide nursing services. Some homes, which are part of extended care facilities, may have a nurse available; other communities may assist residents in arranging for community-based nursing services when necessary.  Retirement Community: Retirement communities are age restricted but the age requirement may vary by community. These communities are typically designed for older individuals who are in reasonable good health and can live independently. Some communities offer rental units, while others require residents to purchase their units. Units can exist in any form in which housing is created, for example, single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, cooperatives or mobile homes. Retirement communities vary in terms of the kinds of services they provide and the fees they charge. Communities may feature extensive recreational and leisure activities; they may also offer supportive services. Communities may offer a few supportive services or they may offer a more comprehensive service package that provides residents a spectrum of health care and supportive services. Some retirement communities are strictly geared for independent living, and they do not assist residents in obtaining supportive services. Residents of these communities must arrange and pay for the supportive services they use. Retirement communities are usually moderate to high priced depending upon the services and amenities they provide. Communities may have strict rules regarding maintenance and compliance with the design of the community.   Residents may, in some cases, be assessed for the management of common areas. The retirement community's section in this directory identifies communities as rentals, condominiums, cooperatives and single-family homes. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS Programs are available that financially help older individuals and that assist elderly homeowners with the costs of home certain types of renovations. These programs are aimed necessary assistance to help people remain in their homes and to obtain housing maintenance and at providing the avoid relocation.  Apartment Conversion for the Elderly (ACE): The Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA) offers the ACE program to homeowners who are at least 62 years of age. ACE provides loans to homeowners to help them make renovations or build additions to their homes that will provide rental income. Additions can be constructed or space in homes can be converted into accessory apartments. This program is intended to provide rental income for elderly homeowners who want to continue to live in their homes but need financial assistance. For additional information contact CHFA at (860) 571-3502. CHOICES Program: The CHOICES program is coordinated by the Department of Social Services and is operated through the State's five Area Agencies on Aging. CHOICES refers to Connecticut's programs for Health insurance assistance, Outreach, Information and referral, Counseling and Eligibility Screening. The purpose of the program is to enable older persons to understand and exercise their rights, receive benefits for which they are entitled and make informed decisions about quality of life issues. It provides free information and assistance about Medicare choices, Medicare Supplemental Insurance, Medicare Managed Care, Medicaid, LongTerm-Care Insurance and other related state and federal programs. CHOICES coordinators in every Area Agency on Aging provide interested individuals with written information, advice and, when appropriate, referrals to trained volunteer counselors for additional assistance. Volunteers meet with elders, other Medicare beneficiaries and family members at different sites throughout the state including adult day centers, meal sites and various housing communities to discuss insurance-related issues. The program also disseminates important information through educational seminars, senior fairs, senior centers and public libraries. Area Agencies on Aging serve as a ""one stop,"" central information source for senior services, a referral service to local providers and a counseling resource for individuals who need assistance with health insurance, nursing homes or other alternative care placements. CHOICES also offers free preliminary eligibility screening for more than 20 state and federal benefits and/or support programs. For more information, contact the statewide toll-free   telephone number, 1-800-994-9422, or the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI). Congregate Housing For The Elderly: Refer to page seven for a detailed description of the Congregate Housing For The Elderly program. Energy Assistance Programs: The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) and the State-Appropriated Fuel Assistance Program (SAFA) help individuals pay their winter heating bills. Households receiving SAFA assistance must have a person who is at least 60 years of age or a person with disabilities living in the household. These individuals must be responsible for paying the heating bills. Benefits are not available to households that have heat included in their rents. Under CEAP, however, eligible renters who have heat included in their rents may receive cash benefits if they pay more than 30 percent of their incomes toward rent. There are both income and asset requirements for the SAFA and CEAP programs. The application period for these programs is from mid-October to March 15. For more information, contact the Department of Social Services, Energy Services Unit at 1-800-842-1132. Housing For Elderly Persons: The Housing For Elderly Persons program provides assistance to non-profit housing developers and public housing authorities in order to develop housing for elderly individuals. Grants and loans are issued for this purpose by the Department of Economic and Community Development. To qualify to live in developments created under this program, residents must be at least 62 years of age or be certified as totally disabled by a federal board or agency. They must also have incomes that are no higher than 80 percent of their area's median income, which is adjusted for household size. The program has no asset limitations. Income residents receive from their assets, however, is included in gross income and, therefore, considered when determining rents. Each resident pays as rent the greater of the following two amounts: (1) a base rent, which is the minimum rent each facility can charge residents and still meet its operating expenses; or (2) a percentage of his or her adjusted gross income, minus a utility allowance. The percentage of income paid cannot exceed 30 percent. A utility allowance is each community's estimate of residents' average monthly utility costs. These estimates only include those utilities that residents pay directly; thus, if all utilities are included in rent, there is no utility allowance. Ten percent of the units in these buildings must be designed to be accessible to persons with disabilities. For more information, contact the local public housing authority. Telephone numbers for local authorities are listed in the blue pages of the telephone directory.   Loans For Accessibility Program and Grants For Accessibility Program: These programs provide low-interest loans and grants to individuals with physical disabilities who need to make renovations to improve the accessibility of their homes. These programs are financed with funds made available through the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. Loans and grants help pay for renovations such as adjusting electrical outlets and switches and installing ramps, grab bars, wide doorways, roll-in showers, lever handles on doors and call-for-aid systems. Loans are made to eligible individuals who have incomes that are at or below 150 percent of the area's median income. Grants are available to eligible persons who have incomes that are at or below 80 percent of the area's median income. In addition to income requirements, both programs require that individuals either have a physical disability and own their own homes, or are parents who own their home and have a child with a physical disability or are renters who have their landlords' written consent to make accessible renovations to their units. Loan and grant amounts can range from $1,000 to $20,000. Annual interest rates on loans may be up to seven percent and are repayable over a maximum of 30 years with a mortgage used to secure the loan. Grants also require that a full lien be placed upon the program participant's home. These lien amounts are reduced automatically by 10 percent annually. At the end of the tenth year, the grant is fully forgiven and the lien removed. In addition to offering grants and loans to promote accessibility, the Corporation for Independent Living provides accessibility services (Homes for Living) to individuals who can afford to pay privately. For more information about these programs, contact the Corporation for Independent Living at (860) 5636011. Low Income Public Housing (LIPH): Low Income Public Housing (LIPH) is a federally subsidized housing program that is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It was originally conceived to provide safe, affordable housing to persons with low incomes and to aid working families. Low-income elderly individuals have been eligible for housing under this program since 1956. Low-income elderly persons are defined as those who are 62 or older with annual incomes less than or equal to 80 percent of their locality's median income. Residents generally pay specified percentages, usually 30 percent, of their adjusted incomes as rent. Public housing communities are owned and administered by local public housing authorities. For more information, call the local public housing authority. Telephone number for local authorities are listed in the blue pages of the telephone directory. Rental Assistance Program (RAP): The Rental Assistance Program (RAP) is a state-administered program that helps low-income individuals pay their rents. This program is comprised of two components; one part assists families and the other helps elderly individuals. The Department of Economic and Community Development administers the portion of RAP that helps older persons through assistance agreements with   local housing sponsors. This part of the program provides rental assistance to eligible residents living in state-financed, rental housing for the elderly. Eligible residents must pay at least 30 percent of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent and utilities. Communities that can provide RAP assistance to elderly individuals include those operating under the Housing for Elderly Persons and Congregate Housing for the Elderly programs. For more information contact the Department of Economic and Community Development at (860) 270-8205. Reverse Annuity Mortgage (RAM) or Home Equity Conversion: Reverse annuity mortgages are a type of home equity conversion plan that allows elderly homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes. Homeowners must own their homes and can borrow up to a predetermined credit limit, based on the fair market value of their homes. The mortgage is not repaid until the sale of the house or the death of the homeowner. Homeowners can receive lump-sum loans or collect fixed, monthly, cash payments. Funds are set aside for RAMS by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA) and by private lenders. Borrowers must be at least 62 years of age to receive loans from most private lenders. Specific features of the programs sponsored by these lenders vary. CHFA loans require borrowers to be at least 70 years of age and have expenses associated with long-term care. When there is more than one borrower, at least one of the parties must have such expenses. Independent social service agencies assess borrowers' needs for long-term-care services. These services should be expected to be needed for an extended period of time, usually more than six months. Long-term care describes a wide range of medical and supportive services provided to persons who have lost some or all capacity to function on their own due to a chronic illness or condition. Homes associated with CHFA loans must be located in Connecticut and be owner-occupied. They can be single-family homes or condominiums. The payment term for these loans is either five or ten years. More detailed information on CHFA loans and a listing of private lenders can be obtained from the Department of Social Services by calling the toll-free number at 1-800-443-9946 or by calling the Elderly Services Division at (860) 424-5283. Rural Rental Housing Loans: Rural Rental Housing Loans are made primarily to assist in building, purchasing or repairing apartment-style housing and providing decent living environments for rural residents. Loans are made to individuals and to both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. They help provide housing in rural areas for persons with low and moderate incomes, for persons who have disabilities and for individuals who are at least 62 years of age. Residents must meet income requirements for occupancy. Residents pay either 30 percent of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent and are granted utility allowances or they pay basic rents plus utilities. Basic rents are determined for each community and are set so that charges are affordable to persons with low incomes. Eligible residents, who pay   more than 30 percent of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent, may reduce rental costs through the Rental Assistance program administered by Rural Housing Service. Funds for this program are limited; all eligible persons may not receive assistance. Rental Assistance (Rural Housing Services): Rental Assistance helps to reduce expenses residents pay for rent and utilities. It is designed for very low- and low-income rural families, including elderly households. Eligible participants must be residents of rental housing that is financed by RHS. They also must meet income requirements. Individuals' incomes must be no higher than 80 percent of their area's median income, which is adjusted for household size. Participants pay no more than 30 percent of their adjusted annual incomes for rent. Funds for this program are limited; assistance may not be available for all eligible individuals. Property Tax Relief for Homeowners and Renters Rebate Program: Elderly homeowners and renters who are eligible for this program receive tax relief benefits. To qualify, individuals must be at least 65 years of age, or be disabled or be a surviving spouse of an approved applicant and be at least 50 years old. Individuals must also meet income eligibility requirements and must have been a Connecticut resident for one year. Homeowners must apply for this program through their local tax assessor between February 1 and May 15. Individuals who rent must apply for rebates between May 15 and September 15. Renters usually apply for rebates at their local senior centers. They also sometimes apply at the Community Action Program Agencies, their town's Department of Social Services or their local tax assessor's office. Where renters can apply for rebates is dependent upon the arrangements that are made by the towns in which they live. Section 202 Housing Assistance: Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 was originally created to help finance the construction and rehabilitation of rental housing for low-income elders and lowincome persons with disabilities. Elderly housing complexes that were built with this assistance before 1991 can have elderly individuals or young persons with disabilities as residents. Although not required, these complexes may provide residents with supportive services. The Section 202 program was recently modified and currently provides housing assistance exclusively to elderly individuals. Housing for persons with disabilities is now funded under a similar program, Section 811. The revised Section 202 program provides residents with supportive services that may include housekeeping services, meals and transportation. The types of supportive services that are provided vary by community. Elderly individuals who live in Section 202 housing must be at least 62 years of age. Any family with a head of household who is at least 62 or a spouse of a head of household who is 62 or older are also eligible. In addition, persons must have very low incomes, which are defined as less than 50 percent of their locality's median income. Residents typically pay 30 percent of their   adjusted monthly incomes toward rent and utilities. For more information call the Department of Housing and Urban Development at (860) 240-4800 or the local public housing authority. Telephone numbers for local authorities are listed in the blue pages of the telephone directory. Section 8 Rental Assistance: Section 8 provides rental assistance to low-income individuals and families. Although this program mainly provides assistance to individuals whose incomes are below 50 percent of their locality's median income, it can in some cases, provide assistance to people who have incomes up to 80 percent of their area's median income. Section 8 is not specifically designed for elderly individuals, but they can be eligible if they meet the income requirements. Individuals may also need to comply with additional requirements. Residents can select the privatelyowned housing in which they want to live and vouchers to subsidize their rents. Dwellings that are chosen must meet HUD's quality standards. Residents who use vouchers must select units with rents that are within the limits set by HUD for fair market rents. These limits may vary in different areas of the state. Vouchers pay the difference between 30 percent of residents adjusted monthly incomes and the established fair market rent. Owners of housing complexes must be willing to accept Section 8 vouchers in order for them to be used. Vouchers can be used anywhere within the state or metropolitan statistical area in which they were issued. Applicants must have incomes that do not exceed 80 percent of the area's median income. Depending upon the costs of the units they choose, residents with vouchers pay different percentages of their incomes toward rent. There are usually waiting lists for Section 8 assistance. For more information, call the local public housing authority. Telephone numbers for local authorities are listed in the blue pages of the telephone directory.   HOME CARE PROGRAMS Adult Family Living: Adult Family Living is an adult foster care program that matches adults who need housing and personal care services with approved host families or individuals. The program allows individuals who are challenged with difficulties related to aging and/or mental or physical disability to live in the community in a family setting and receive supportive services. Participants must be unable to live independently and must demonstrate that they have difficulty in at least one of the following areas: 1) planning and preparing meals, managing personal finances and housekeeping and laundry services, 2) taking medication in proper doses at the correct times (to the extent it prevents a person from living independently) and 3) social or personal adjustment, most often as a result of mental disability or acquired brain injury. In exchange for a monthly financial contribution, the host family provides participants with meals, assistance with daily activities, housekeeping and shopping services and, when necessary, 24hour supervision. For more information call Sage Services at (203) 777-7401. Adult Home Share Programs: Home share programs match suitable individuals as housemates, one of whom must be at least 60 years of age. Individuals share their homes with other persons in exchange for financial payments, services, companionship and/or other contributions. These programs can help elderly individuals receive the assistance necessary to remain in their communities and avoid institutionalization. Program staff screen participants, identify housemates with complementary needs, introduce individuals who are compatible, help develop home sharing agreements, offer follow-up counseling and refer persons to other appropriate services when necessary. The Department of Social Services currently funds home share programs in North Central, South Central and Eastern Connecticut. For more information, contact the program coordinator in the appropriate region of the state. Appendix IV provides a list of programs and their coordinators. Companion Services/Friendly Visitor Programs: Companion services and friendly visitor programs provide outreach to frail elders who are homebound. Trained individuals and volunteers, working under the direction of social service agencies, regularly visit older adults who either live alone or are socially and/or geographically isolated. Visitors may provide elders with friendship, companionship and some assistance with tasks. Regular telephone contact with older adults may also be offered in order to provide them with reassurance, social contact and security. Some programs may help elderly individuals with their grocery shopping and basic errands. Assistance with light chores, letter writing, light meal preparation and escort services may also be   offered. These programs do not generally provide hand-on care or medical assistance. For more information, contact the town's Department of Social Services or the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI). Connecticut Home Care Program for Elders: The Connecticut Home Care Program for Elders helps frail, older adults stay in their homes by providing a wide range of home-care services. Available services include: adult day care, homemaker, companion, chore, home-delivered meals, respite, emergency response systems, case management, home-health services, mental-health counseling and adult foster care. The program's three-tiered structure gives individuals the opportunity to receive home care services in amounts that correspond to their financial resources and functional dependence. The Department of Social Services Alternate Care Unit screens applicants to determine eligibility. Eligibility requirements vary by the different tiers. Eligible individuals are referred to Access Agencies for independent and comprehensive assessments. Access Agencies determine participants' needs and develop their care plans. If necessary, they may provide ongoing case management to coordinate and monitor the services participants receive. Individuals must be at least 65 years of age and meet income and asset requirements. Participants may be required to contribute toward the cost of the services they receive. Participation in the program depends on the availability of funds; enrollment may, at times, be temporarily suspended and a waiting list for services may be initiated. For more information, contact the Department of Social Services at 1800-445-5394. Elderly Nutrition Program: The elderly nutrition program provides nutritionally balanced meals to elderly individuals and their spouses. Nutrition services include home-delivered and congregate meals. Home-delivered meals are provided to homebound elders and are generally delivered on weekdays; however, meals may also be delivered in the evenings and on weekends. Congregate meals are served in senior centers, elderly housing complexes, schools, churches, synagogues and other community settings. These meals are usually served five days a week, although, in some cases, they may be served more often. Meals are provided to eligible participants free of charge; donations are encouraged, however, and are used to provide additional meals. Participants must be at least 60 years old or be a spouse of a participant. To qualify for home-delivered meals, persons 60 and older must be homebound and may have to meet certain assessment criteria. Emphasis is given to serving those individuals with the greatest economic or social need. Persons with disabilities who are not 60 years of age may receive congregate meals if the housing communities in which they live provide such meals, and if the communities are primarily occupied by elderly residents. For more information, contact the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI) or the Department of Social Services at 1-800-443-9946.   Emergency Call System: An emergency call system enables elderly individuals to secure help in medical and physical emergencies. Individuals are usually linked to local hospitals, nursing homes or other emergency response units by a small alarm that is typically worn either around the neck or on the wrist as a bracelet. When individuals activate alarms they receive help from the response unit. The unit may contact nearby relatives or friends or, depending upon the situation, dispatch an ambulance. Private service organizations or health care facilities generally manage emergency call systems. Individuals, in most cases, must pay for the services the systems provide. Many elderly housing communities have emergency call systems installed in residents' units. Pull cords associated with such systems are usually installed in bathrooms and/or bedrooms; systems may also be installed in residents' telephones. These systems are typically linked to staff-monitored stations or offices within housing communities and are generally covered under the residents' monthly fees. Home-Health Care: Home-health care provides services to individuals that enable them to receive certain kinds of medical care while residing in their homes. A team of specialists who work in collaboration with a physician provides care. Members of the team may include nurses, health aides, therapists and/or nutrition providers. Payment for services can be made privately by individuals or by insurance companies. Medicare, Medicaid or Older Americans Act funds may also pay for services.. For more information contact the town's Department of Social Services or the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI). Homemaker/ Home Chore Services: Homemaker services assist older persons who need help with household functions because of temporary illnesses or chronic disabling conditions. Services include help with cooking, light housekeeping, laundry, grocery shopping, meal preparation and light household chores. Services can be arranged through private, home-health agencies or by the town's Department of Social Services. For more information, contact a local home health agency, the town's Department of Social Services or the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI). Resident Services Coordinators: Elderly housing communities and management companies may employ resident services coordinators to help individuals residing in their communities. Resident services coordinators perform an array of functions that help improve the quality of residents' lives. Most importantly, they help residents receive the supportive services they need to live independently in their apartments. Functions performed by resident services coordinators may include identifying residents who are in need, determining necessary or desired services and coordinating and monitoring service delivery. In addition to assisting individual residents with   supportive services, services coordinators address broader concerns that affect entire housing communities. They serve as resident advocates and may organize social activities. Resident services coordinators can work full or part time; they can work exclusively for one community or have the responsibility of providing service coordination for multiple housing sites. Transportation: Community-based transportation services allow eligible individuals to make appointments to be transported to such places as medical facilities, shopping areas, financial institutions, meal sites and other locations. Individuals are picked up at their homes and taken to their destinations. For more information, contact the town's Department of Social Services, the local senior center or the regional Area Agency on Aging (see Appendix VI).   IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT THE DIRECTORY A designation is provided in the directory that gives consumers information about housing communities that offer residents more than one type of care. These communities may offer independent living and supportive care, or they may provide different levels of supportive services. Communities that have more than one kind of care available are listed under each type of living environment that is offered. The names of these living environments are not always the same and, therefore, not always easily recognized as being part of the same housing community. Communities that offer more that one type of care are indicated by a "" "" to the left of the communities' names. Many programs are available to help elderly individuals with housing costs. These programs provide people with assistance in different ways. Eligible individuals may use a combination of existing programs to help make housing more affordable. Programs can help persons by providing direct rental subsidies or by helping in various ways to establish below-market rents. Some programs stipulate that residents pay certain percentages, usually no more that 30 percent, of their adjusted gross incomes toward rent. Other programs establish fixed charges for rent that are considered affordable to persons with limited incomes. Housing communities associated with such programs are identified by a ""3 "" to the right of the communities' names. Communities that are associated with the state's Congregate Housing For The Elderly program have ""state congregate"" written next to their names. Some housing communities listed in the directory are either not yet available for occupancy or have not yet been approved to provide a particular kind of care. These communities have dates specified when they anticipate opening or delivering certain types of supportive care. Some communities, such as those that intend to use assisted living services agencies to provide supportive services, may already be operating under different living environments. The dates specified for these communities indicate when the provision of services by an assisted living services agency is anticipated. Most managed residential communities listed in this directory under ""assisted living"" do not offer residents assistance with monthly charges. Residents of these communities generally use private resources to pay for housing costs and supportive services. A few managed residential communities listed in the directory are associated with government programs that provide reduced rents to eligible residents. Residents who receive assisted living services in these communities may incur additional charges for services; these charges may not be subsidized. All residents, including those who receive supportive services, are required to comply with the conditions of communities' lease agreements.   Retirement communities listed in the directory are specified as being rentals, condominiums, single-family homes and/or cooperatives. Some communities may offer residents the option of renting or owning units. Single-family homes may be in planned communities where residents own their homes or they may be in complexes that are managed by condominium associations. In addition, some communities are comprised of different housing structures. They may have any combination of attached housing, multifamily housing and/or single-family cottages. A contact name is not specified for every retirement community. Any number of realtors can be used to determine the availability of units in certain communities, especially those in which residents own units and are responsible for selling them when changes in residency occur. The contacts for these communities are identified as ""local realtors."" In certain cases, developers may have agreements with specific realtors to sell units in their developments. The directory may, therefore, list individual realty companies. Such a listing does not designate a recommendation or endorsement of any realty company of behalf of the Department of Social Services.   Housing Communities Elderly Housing communities listed in this directory are sorted alphabetically by housing type and municipality. The information is limited to data that was compiled during the period of inquiry and is subject to change. A number of different resources were used to prepare this inventory; data was not always gathered directly from specific housing communities. A listing in this directory does not indicate a specific recommendation or endorsement of any community by the Department of Social services. Individuals who are interested in additional information about a particular community should directly contact the person, housing community, management company or housing authority that is specified under ""contact.""   Southwestern Connecticut Bridgeport Darien -Noroton -Noroton Heights  Norwalk -East Norwalk -Rowayton -South Norwalk  Easton Fairfield -Southport  Stamford -Glennbrook -Springdale West Stamford  Greenwich -Byram -Cos Cob -Glensville -Old Greenwich -Riverside  Stratford Trumbull -Nichols  Weston Westport -Green Farms -Saugatuck  Monroe -Stevenson  New Canaan  Wilton   1  ASSISTED LIVING Bridgeport u 3030 Park Avenue 3030 Park Avenue Bridgeport, CT 06604 Contact : Stella Dima (203) 374-5611  Darien Stony Brook Court 50 Ledge Road Darien, CT 06820 Contact : Wendy Wheat (203) 662-1090  Greenwich u The Mews 1/2 Bolling Place Greenwich, CT 06830 Contact : Bernice Kolosowski (203) 869-9448  Stamford u Atria Courtland Gardens - Stamford 59 Courtland Avenue Stamford, CT 06902 Atria Town Center 26 Mill River Street Stamford, CT 06902 Brighton Gardens of Stamford 59 Roxbury Road Stamford, CT 06904 u Edgehill Health Center 122 Palmers Hill Road Stamford, CT 06902 Sunrise Assisted Living of Stamford 251 Turn of River Road Stamford, CT 06905 Westfield Court 77 Third Street Stamford, CT 06905 Contact : Josephine Short (203) 359-2000  Contact : Marilyn Mahoney (203) 978-1666  Contact : Marilyn Chamberland (203) 322-2100  Contact : Debra Crilley (203) 323-2323  Contact : Elaina Whiteside (203) 968-8393  Contact : Julie ForesterAlexandre (203) 327-4551  u = Community has more than one type of care.   2  ASSISTED LIVING (Cont.)

GX246-40-0000000	Maryland in Focus HOME     County Pages    Allegany   Anne Arundel   Baltimore City   Baltimore County   Calvert   Caroline   Carroll   Cecil   Charles   Dorchester   Frederick   Garrett   Harford   Howard   Kent   Montgomery   Prince George's   Queen Anne's   St. Mary's   Somerset   Talbot   Washington   Wicomico   Worcester         Maryland State Archives   Photographic Collections          Montgomery County was created from Frederick County by resolve of the Constitutional Convention of 1776. It is bordered on the northwest by Frederick County, the northeast by Howard County, the south and southeast by the Prince George's County and the District of Columbia, and the southwest by the Potomac River. The county is named for General Richard Montgomery (1738-1775) of the American Revolution.   Rockville has been the county seat of Montgomery County since 1777. County officers first met at Hungerford's Tavern here, then in a house owned by Thomas O. Williams that was improved with public funds to function as a courthouse. Williams laid out lots for a town around the courthouse in 1784, naming it Williamsburg. The boundaries of the lots were disputed, so in 1801 an act was passed by the Maryland General Assembly requiring a new survey and changing the town's name to Rockville. Today, Rockville is a thriving suburban center in the Washington metropolitan area. In addition to extensive commercial development that serves residents of the area, Rockville has developed into a center of computer, communications, and nuclear energy industries.   Visitors to Montgomery County enjoy the numerous parks and historic houses in the county. At the Great Falls of the Potomac, the Potomac River descends from the plateau down to tidewater in a spectacular series of rapids and cataracts. the falls are part of a park that includes restored portions of the C&O Canal and the Great Falls Tavern. Numerous ruins and artifacts date from the period when water power was harnessed for industrial purposes before it was replaced by steam and eventually electricity. The Clara Barton House, located near Glen Echo, was a gift to Clara Barton by the city of Johnstown, Pennsylvania in appreciation for her humanitarian work in the aftermath of the great Johnstown flood of 1889. Much of the lumber used in this construction was salvaged from emergency buildings put up after the flood. The house was the headquarters of the American Red Cross until 1904.                        Cabin John Bridge was begun in 1857 and completed in 1864. At the time it was constructed it was the largest single arch span in the western hemisphere, two hundred feet in length. This photograph was made in 1859.   MSA SC 1477-4748               A nationwide Depression in 1893 inspired five hundred unemployed workers to march from Ohio to Washington, D.C. Seen here as they passed through Montgomery County, the group became known as Coxey's Army because of their leader (seated and looking toward the camera), Jacob Schler Coxey.    MSA SC 1477-6770               By the early twentieth century, commercial use of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal had slowed and many, like these swimmers and boaters, considered the waterway a recreation spot.   MSA SC 1477-6045               The Glen Echo Lock was the eighth of a total of seventy-four locks on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal which raised it from seal level to 610 feet in Cumberland.

GX246-86-5379474	"Site Navigation                  DEP Preparing To Reclaim Abandoned Mines    HARRISBURG (May 22)  -- Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary James M. Seif today announced $8.2 million in construction contracts to reclaim abandoned mines in 11 counties.    The projects will restore 14 abandoned mine sites in Allegheny, Butler, Cambria, Clarion, Columbia, Elk, Fayette, Jefferson, Montgomery, Somerset and Westmoreland counties.    ""These projects are just one part of a comprehensive mine reclamation strategy to reclaim abandoned mines by encouraging remining, use of innovative reclamation technology and cooperation with county conservation districts and others,"" Seif said.    The projects are funded either by Pennsylvania’s appropriation from the federal Abandoned Mine Land Trust Fund or the state Bond Forfeiture Program, both administered by DEP. The federal funds come from a levy on current coal operators. The Trust Fund has a current unappropriated balance in excess of $1.2 billion, and typically appropriates $141 million annually to the states, about $100 million less than annual income into the fund.     The state program is funded through bonds forfeited to the state by mine operators who failed to reclaim the lands they have mined. Mine operators are required to purchase bonds before they receive their mining permits.    Following are descriptions of the 14 projects.    Allegheny County    * G&K Construction of Prospect: $51,107.10 for stream rehabilitation work at an unnamed tributary to Streets Run Stream near Baldwin, including replacement of a 135-foot wall.    Butler County    * IT Corporation of Monroeville: $3,143,756 for soil remediation in Bruin, including removal of asbestos waste, building debris and coal refuse; fencing; soil cover and revegetation.    Cambria County    * Greenley Energy Holdings of Pa. of Greensburg: $744,221 to remove a coal refuse pile near Little Paint Creek in Richland Township.    Clarion County    * E&M Brown Inc. of Clearfield: $363,767 to reclaim 27 acres of mine land abandoned by R.E.M. Coal Co. in Limestone Township, including grading, adding soil and reseeding.    * Utilities Forestry Services Inc. of Clearfield: $224,437.98 to reclaim 28 acres of abandoned mine land in PerryTownship, involving grading, wetland mitigation and seeding.    Columbia County    * Earthmovers Unlimited Inc. of Kylertown: $2,239238.71 to backfill strip pits, grade and seed 127 acres of McCauley Mountain in Beaver Township.    Elk County    * Michael H. Holt T/A Hugh Water Services of Brockway: $13,011 for mechanical maintenance and $6,918 for electrical maintenance at the Toby Creek acid mine drainage treatment plant in Fox Township.    Fayette County    * Earthmovers Unlimited Inc. of Kylertown: $97,479 to reclaim 15 acres of mine land abandoned by the Ren-Lau Coal Co. in North Union Township.    Jefferson County    * W. Ruskin Dressler T/A Dressler Coal of Rockton: $71,265.57 to reclaim 9.6 acres of mine land abandoned by Roseville North East in Union Township.    Montgomery County    * SJB Services Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y.: $4,470 for subsurface exploration in preparation for channel improvements to Plymouth Creek in the Borough of Conshohocken.    Somerset County    * Casselman Enterprises Inc. of Somerset: $738,020 to seal deep mine openings on the east side of Oven Run, grade excavate line and seed 56 acres of abandoned mine land in Shade Township.

There are four separate water districts, three separate fire departments and four separate village centers. In addition, there are some agricultural areas. The villages began to develop their distinctive characters in the 18th century, and by the 19th century when two rail lines and a trolley line opened the town to population growth, newcomers generally migrated to the village that appealed to them. John King was the first settler in Palmer, building his home in 1716 on the banks of the Chicopee River. He was followed by a large group of Scottish-Irish Presbyterians who arrived and put down their roots in 1727. Depot Village has been the main commercial and business center for 125 years. Bondsville is the site of much of the town's industry, beginning in the 18th century when the first saw and grist mills were established. By 1825, textile production began in town with a woolen mill. The Blanchard Scythe Factory, Wright Wire Woolen Mills and the Holden-Fuller Woolen Mills developed major industrial capacity in Palmer and constructed a large amount of workers housing. By 1900 a company like Boston Duck which made heavy cotton fabric, had housed 500 employees in the town in workers housing which remains as part of the town fabric. (Seal supplied by community.

GX271-38-3971750	"UXBRIDGE Worcester County NARRATIVE GEOGRAPHY GOVERNMENT DEMOGRAPHICS HOUSING_CHARACTERISTICS TRANSPORTATION CULTURE AND RECREATION MISCELLANEOUS  NARRATIVE Narrative The Town of Uxbridge lies on the southern border of Massachusetts at the Rhode Island line. The community is industrial, agricultural and residential in nature and both the Blackstone River, two of its major tributaries and several large brooks run through town. Established as a town in 1727, Uxbridge's bountiful water power provided the basis for large scale industrial development beginning as early as 1775. Uxbridge was the site of a Nipmuck Indian village as well as of one of the Christian Indian settlements established to protect Indian converts. Quakers from Rhode Island established a colony in the town and built the earliest meetinghouse in Uxbridge in 1770, a building which still survives. Residents established the Uxbridge Social and Instructive Library in 1775 and a grammar school in 1788. Good quality iron ore, which had been mined since the 1730's, supported a forge and a triphammer. In that era the town was primarily a prosperous agricultural settlement with dispersed farms, but it was also the site of saw and grist mills and a gin distillery. 0, textile manufacturing had been introduced when Daniel Day erected a small carding and spinning mill, which was the second textile mill on the Blackstone River and the third one in the state. Capron Mills in 1820 introduced power loom weaving of woolen cloth in their factory on the Mumford River, the first such looms ever constructed. In 1827, major industrial complexes such as the massive granite Crown and Eagle Mills assumed great economic importance. The Crown and Eagle boasted a large-scale water power system and clusters of worker's duplexes. But agriculture remained a basic component of the town's economy and residents also grew grain and potatoes, managed apple orchards, dairy farms and cattle herds. Settlers traded their agricultural produce and manufactured and forest products for foreign goods in Providence and their commercial ties with that city were strong. The Blackstone Canal, completed in 1828, facilitated the transport of agricultural goods, raw materials and finished products to all points between Worcester and Providence. Since Uxbridge was halfway between the two, it became an overnight stopping place for canal boats. Immigration grew, primarily of people from Ireland, to work the mills and make shoes and boots and by 1855, 560 people produced 2.5 million yards of cotton and woolen cloth in Uxbridge mills. The town's stone quarries produced the stone to rebuild Boston after the Great fire, and during the Civil War several of the town's mills ran on 24-hour shifts to fill government orders. In the First World War the town's economy boomed again as the mills worked to produce khaki overcoat cloth for America, France and Italy. As late as 1983, Calumet Mill was still making fancy woolens in Uxbridge. The town retains over 60 handsome Federalist houses as a legacy of its history. Seal supplied by community.

GX271-19-12736491	"HARDWICK Worcester County  NARRATIVE GEOGRAPHY GOVERNMENT DEMOGRAPHICS HOUSING_CHARACTERISTICS TRANSPORTATION CULTURE AND RECREATION MISCELLANEOUS  NARRATIVE Narrative The Town of Hardwick, a rural industrial hill town in the highlands northwest of the Ware River corridor, lies on the western border of Worcester County. The town is part of a tract of land purchased from the Indians in 1686 by a group of settlers from Roxbury. The first European settlement occurred around 1730, and Hardwick became an agricultural community with grazing and orchards on well-watered lands. Seasonal work for residents came from lumbering, potash and charcoal making and mining of bog iron. As industry grew and changed in Hardwick, the community developed into four distinct villages: Furnace, with saw, grist and fulling mills and furnaces; Gilbertville, with its textile company that built company housing and mill buildings; Wheelwright, which was essentially built to house and employ paper mill employees; and Hardwick Village. In 1832, the iron foundry at Furnace Village used 180 tons of ore and 36,000 bushels of charcoal from Hardwick's forests to produce hollow ware castings. Those not employed in agriculture or iron works staffed a tannery and made palm leaf hats. Jobs and prosperity brought growth to the town and over 2,200 people were recorded in the community by the 1870's, many of them Irish and French Canadian immigrants. By the beginning of the 20th century, there was a large Polish immigration and the total foreign born population reached 44% of the residents. In the early 20th century, the Quabbin Reservoir depopulated the western upland areas of Hardwick and flooded some valleys. With a decline in industrial activity, Hardwick was left with a robust agricultural business involved in poultry raising, market gardening and dairying. Hardwick Center remains an unusually intact example of early 19th century highland meetinghouse village. (Seal supplied by community.
