Little is known of his life other than the fact that he taught at Alexandria, being associated with the school that grew up there in the late 4th cent.  B.C.  He is famous for his  Elements,  a presentation in thirteen books of the geometry and other mathematics known in his day. The first six books cover elementary plane geometry and have served since as the basis for most beginning courses on this subject. The other books of the  Elements  treat the theory of numbers and certain problems in arithmetic (on a geometric basis) and solid geometry, including the five regular polyhedra, or Platonic solids. The great contribution of Euclid was his use of a deductive system for the presentation of mathematics. Primary terms, such as point and line, are defined; unproved assumptions, or postulates, regarding these terms are stated; and a series of statements are then deduced logically from the definitions and postulates. Although Euclid’s system no longer satisfies modern requirements of logical rigor, its importance in influencing the direction and method of the development of mathematics is undisputed. One consequence of the critical examination of Euclid’s system was the discovery in the early 19th cent. that his fifth postulate, equivalent to the statement that one and only one line parallel to a given line can be drawn through a point external to the line, can not be proved from the other postulates; on the contrary, by substituting a different postulate for this parallel postulate two different self-consistent forms of  non-Euclidean geometry  were deduced, one by Nikolai I. Lobachevsky (1826) and independently by János Bolyai (1832) and another by Bernhard Riemann (1854). A few modern historians have questioned Euclid’s authorship of the  Elements,  but he is definitely known to have written other works, most notably the  Optics.                The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.

Depending on the type of joint, such separated elements may or may not move on one another. This article discusses the joints of the human body—particularly their structure but also their ligaments, nerve and blood supply, and nutrition. Although the discussion focuses on human joints, its content is applicable to joints of  vertebrates  in general and  mammals  in particular. For information about the disorders and injuries that commonly affect human joints,  see   joint disease .                 Joint movements       In order to describe the main types of joint structures, it is helpful first to summarize the motions made possible by joints. These motions include spinning, swinging, gliding, rolling, and approximation.   Spin is a movement of a bone around its own long axis; it is denoted by the anatomical term  rotation . An important example of spin is provided by the radius (outer bone of the forearm); this bone can spin upon the lower end of the humerus (upper arm) in all positions of the elbow. When an individual presses the back of the hand against the mouth, the forearm is pronated, or twisted; when the palm of the hand is pressed against the mouth, the forearm is supinated, or untwisted. Pronation is caused by medial (inward) rotation of the radius and supination by lateral (outward) rotation.   Swing, or  angular movement, brings about a change in the angle between the long axis of the moving bone and some reference line in the fixed bone. Flexion (bending) and extension (straightening) of the elbow are examples of swing. A swing (to the right or left) of one bone away from another is called abduction; the reverse, adduction.   Approximation denotes the movement caused by pressing or pulling one bone directly toward another—i.e., by a “translation” in the physical sense. The reverse of approximation is separation. Gliding and rolling movements occur only within synovial joints and cause a moving bone to swing.

Uranus , from Gk.  Ouranos  lit. ""heaven,"" in Gk. cosmology, the god who personifies the heavens, father of the titans. Cf.  Urania , name of the Muse of astronomy, from Gk.  Ourania , fem. of  ouranios , lit. ""heavenly."" Planet discovered and identified as such in 1781 by Sir William Herschel (it had been observed before, but mistaken for a star, cf. 1690 when John Flamsteed cataloged it as 34 Tauri); Herschel proposed calling it  Georgium Sidus , lit. ""George's Star,"" in honour of his patron, King George III of England. ""I cannot but wish to take this opportunity of expressing my sense of gratitude, by giving the name of Georgium Sidus ... to a star which (with respect to us) first began to shine under His auspicious reign."" [Sir William Herschel, 1783] The planet was known in Eng. in 1780s as the  Georgian Planet ; Fr. astronomers began calling  Herschel , and ult. Ger. astronomer Johann Bode proposed  Uranus  as in conformity with other planet names. However, the name didn't come into common usage until c.1850.

Woodson              Americans have recognized black history annually since 1926, first as ""Negro History Week"" and later as "" Black History Month ."" What you might not know is that black history had barely begun to be studied-or even documented-when the tradition originated. Although blacks have been in America at least as far back as colonial times, it was not until the 20th century that they gained a respectable presence in the history books.    Blacks Absent from History Books   We owe the celebration of Black History Month, and more importantly, the study of black history, to  Dr. Carter G. Woodson . Born to parents who were former slaves, he spent his childhood working in the Kentucky coal mines and enrolled in high school at age twenty. He graduated within two years and later went on to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard. The scholar was disturbed to find in his studies that history books largely ignored the black American population-and when blacks did figure into the picture, it was generally in ways that reflected the inferior social position they were assigned at the time.    Established Journal of Negro History   Woodson, always one to act on his ambitions, decided to take on the challenge of writing black Americans into the nation's history. He established the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (now called the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History) in 1915, and a year later founded the widely respected Journal of Negro History. In 1926, he launched Negro History Week as an initiative to bring national attention to the contributions of black people throughout American history.    Woodson chose the second week of February for Negro History Week because it marks the birthdays of two men who greatly influenced the black American population,  Frederick Douglass  and  Abraham Lincoln . However, February has much more than Douglass and Lincoln to show for its significance in black American history. For example:      February 23, 1868:   W. E. B. DuBois , important civil rights leader and co-founder of the NAACP, was born.    February 3, 1870:  The  15th Amendment  was passed, granting blacks the right to vote.    February 25, 1870:  The first black U.S. senator,  Hiram R. Revels  (1822-1901), took his oath of office.     February 12, 1909:  The  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  ( NAACP ) was founded by a group of concerned black and white citizens in New York City.    February 1, 1960:  In what would become a  civil-rights movement  milestone, a group of black Greensboro, N.C., college students began a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter.    February 21, 1965:   Malcolm X , the militant leader who promoted Black Nationalism, was shot to death by three Black Muslims.

Did you know?     ""Confabulation"" is a fabulous word for fantastic fabrication. Given the similarities in spelling and sound, you might guess that ""confabulation"" and ""fabulous"" come from the same root, and they do -- the Latin ""fabula,"" which means ""conversation"" or ""story."" Another ""fabula"" descendant that continues to tell tales in English is ""fable."" ""Fabrication,"" however, comes from a different Latin source: the word ""fabrica,"" meaning ""workshop"" or ""structure.""     *Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

Some of these processes are mechanical, e.g., the expansion and contraction caused by sudden, large changes in temperature, the expansive force of water freezing in cracks, the splitting caused by plant roots, and the impact of running water; others are chemical, e.g., oxidation, hydration, carbonization, and loss of chemical elements by solution in water. Weathering is important because it aids in the formation of soil and prepares materials for  erosion . Construction materials for buildings and roads are subject to weathering by water, carbon dioxide, aerosol gases, freeze-thaw cycles, and salt (see also formation of  potholes ). New techniques in road construction, allowing a minimum of weathering, more weather-resistant aggregates, and better building materials have lowered costs for maintenance and repair.

Raffles, Sir Stamford         0.07 sec.         Raffles, Sir (Thomas) Stamford (born July 6, 1781, at sea off Port Morant, Jam.—died July 5, 1826, London, Eng.) Administrator in the British  East India Company  and founder of Singapore. He joined the British East India Company at age 14, and his hard work won him an appointment as assistant secretary to the government of Penang (in present-day Malaysia). There he undertook an intensive study of the Malayan peoples, and his knowledge allowed him to play a key role in 1811, when the British defeated Dutch-French forces in Java. He subsequently became lieutenant governor there and inaugurated a mass of reforms aimed at transforming the Dutch colonial system and improving the condition of the native population. He was recalled by the company, which deemed his reforms too costly; though he was popular in London (he was knighted in 1816), his authority when he resumed his service in Southeast Asia was severely restricted. Undeterred, he founded the port city of Singapore in 1819 in order to to ensure British access to the China seas; in 1824 the Dutch relinquished all claims to Singapore. Raffles is credited with creating Britain's Far Eastern empire. How to thank TFD for its existence?
