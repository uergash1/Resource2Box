One is by the front entrance and the other is in the entryway to the lower level of the building, where it can be seen by the students on their way to lunch or the gymnasium as well as by the general public using the community room. Embedded in the cement are individual clay pieces and found objects such as mosaics, stones, shells, leafs, keys, and other fascinating, simple and ordinary objects from all over the world. As many of the students as possible were engaged in the creation of the art. At a workshop the students drew on and cut rolled-out clay to make silhouettes of themselves and other images for the murals. After the workshop, the artist took the clay back to her studio and applied to it clear glaze and fired it to protect it for posterity.   Rosenberg has created numerous other Boston-area works, including a large mosaic in the MBTA Park Street subway station and another mural for the lobby of the Children's Hospital. Two of her murals can be found at the Central Square Library in Cambridge and the Miller's River Apartments in East Cambridge. Trained in architecture, sculpture, and ceramics, she studied at the Cooper Union and Art Students League (both in New York City), as well as at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She has lived in New England for most of her working life.   Commissioned through the Cambridge Arts Council's Public Art Program"

The theme selected is entirely up to the group of children who wish to       participate in the project. These murals will be linked together by       seams and grommets to create an amazing odyssey of color and       spontaneity.         Once completed, the murals will travel to major cities around the       world, as organized by the American and International Red Cross.         Please notify a  project       contact  as soon as possible       to register your mural effort. To qualify for the Art Mile       project,  murals must be completed and submitted by the date shown below for the theme       selected.

For information about the  project founders ,       see  biographies !                                                                             Project       History                                                                                     A Visual Journey         (Personal Thoughts from Joanne Tawfilis, updated June 5, 2001)         Somehow we (my husband Fouad and myself)       never dreamt the mural project would get so much attention. The reason for       creating it remains as it was meant to be: an activity that belongs to the       children of the world, one that we originated and now coordinate, and one       that surprises me for the magnitude of what is spreading and for the       symbol it now represents to children everywhere.         We can say that there is no feeling that       can compare to looking at each looming and beautiful individual mural.       Watching a twelve foot by five foot piece of blank piece canvas transform       into a masterpiece, is a delight that tingles my heartstrings and fills me       with indescribable joy. It is truly pleasurable to look at the children's       faces before they start painting, and when they stand back and look at the       final product.         With each brush stroke, the masterpiece       grows like a spring flower in an over night rainstorm. With each different       mural, and each we get to personally witness being created, we feel them       become a part of us. We are joyous that this positive energy and often       times the children's sad and lonely feelings transfers onto canvas and can       be absorbed in my soul. Sometimes I wish we could absorb the pain and hurt       as much as we do the happiness and enthusiasm. We feel helpless when we       see the portrayal of war and violence, but we know that putting it on       canvas will help them heal and eventually let go.         Fouad and I benefit the most. It's a life's       reward in a way, to be able to carry that energy, those feelings, and       those imaginations with me. We often have flashbacks of the look on the       children's faces and that's why we I talk about it a lot. Those beautiful       children's faces! And Fouad captures that through his eyes on film.         When we receive a mural by mail or       otherwise, it's also a real marvel. As we tear open a box or rip off a       plastic cover, it's like Christmas all over again. With each opening, we       feel the children's spirit jump off that canvas straight into my heart. We       can feel their laughter and teasing of one another, and feel the       reflective ness of those shy and quiet ones. We can see them too,       standing, practically leaning close to the canvas, putting themselves       hesitantly onto a corner or piece they claim as their own painting space.         And so, the Visual Journey continues, and       we feel the spontaneity and pure spirits of these young people.         We can smell the jacaranda trees and       imagine the giraffe loping through a Kenyan dusk on the Masai Mara, when       we look at the colors and figures the children and Tobias Mumbi created       for millions of children to eventually see. And we can hear the fun and       laughter of the youngsters from St. Mary's School in Nairobi as they stood       back admiring their beautiful work.         We can see Yusheng Zhao's longing for her       beloved China as she coaches the children with another wonderful Peruvian       Artist Coach, Carmen Rocios Pena de Klein, as the children paint the       lively and colorful fish-vivid and alive…like the dancing colors of Peru       and glistening fish of China.         We feel Goran's despair and the children of       Kosovo and Bosnia's pain and nightmares when we see the paintings of tanks       and grenades, of empty lands, destroyed buildings, and kerchiefed women       and children fleeing along country roads.         And from the Millennium International       Children's Conference on the environment, both Fouad and I feel the       connections to the children who care, the hundreds that came to paint       topics like ""Living in Cities, Water is Life, and Sharing the       Planet"". Oh, the connections to the Malaysians, the Palestinians, the       Israelis, the children from Ghana and Azerbaijan! We can see the       fifty-eight Korean children amassed on the floor designing together a       national mural-a magnificent mural completed in just 3 hours!         When we look at these murals, each of them,       we see something new each time, and savor the joy of children being       together unaffected by the barriers the world so readily constructs around       them. These are the moments that we seize, Fouad and me. There is no       photo, no exhibition, and no notoriety than can take those moments from       us-selfish, as it seems.         By growing up in a world of bigotry and       racism, sexism, and all the other ""isms"" that exist, this mural       project works like an electric eraser. They wash away the years of tears,       the injured heart, the clipped wings, the prisons and ropes that always       get in the way of letting us care, really care, about each other.         Working on the canvas allows each child a       little bit of time to throw away or forget the nuances that parents and       adults engrain in their children, for it is they who tend to teach them       how to draw lines in the sand, color in the lines, and separate themselves       by color. And each child affected by war and severe spiritual loss, or       those of different colors, or religion, or physical and mental ailments       get to give of each other and reach out to document what they really think       and feel inside. It is their view of the world, their flicker of       brightness that reflects in their eyes when they explore and communicate       among themselves. It is they, these children who see how different they       are, yet how much alike they be. When those differences unite them, it is       the time and place on the canvas that these children, even for a short       duration are the real peacemakers of today and our hope for tomorrow.         We are blessed to be able to coordinate a       project that was and remains a joint effort between my husband and me. It       is our love; our devotion and our common grounding that makes us believe       so much in the children of this earth. Infinity becomes understandable       when we work with these children. And through his eyes, he captures their       souls on film, making my memories more intense and lasting.         For us, the joys continue and with a       growing sense of emotional wealth, I look forward to the next twelve or       twenty four foot stretch of canvas and the brushes, the paint, the tarps,       the children. Yes, the children!                                                                                     Why                        Participate                                                                                     Children, parents and sponsors should       understand the importance of the Art Mile project and what their       contribution and participation will mean.  Their work will represent       themselves, their community, their school, organization,       town, state, AND country.  These murals will be seen world       wide and historically significant.   You and your children can make history  as       of the Mile Art project.

It dates from the Later Liang dynasty, just after the fall of the Tang. Wang was a high official who died in A.D. 923, having served both Tang and Liang Dynasty rulers. The design of Wang's tomb, though essentially in Tang style, anticipated future artistic developments.   This is one of two reliefs that framed the coffin chamber, part of a complex of rooms arranged on a north-south axis and accessed via a ramp at the south. The decoration in Wang's tomb followed the imperial Tang model, with lively painted wall murals lining passageways and tomb chambers. Tang painting was mostly figurative, and this emphasis is still evident in the marble panel. Several ink landscape paintings, which were also found in the tomb, however, were precursors of an entirely new genre.    Much of Wang's tomb art had been looted prior to excavation in 1995, but the two painted marble reliefs remained in excellent condition. The east wall relief shows a group of thirteen female attendants carrying luxury items to ensure the tomb owner's well-being. The relief on the west wall (shown here) is a lively depiction of a female orchestra, along with a conductor and two tiny dancers at the lower right. The combination of these and other paintings in the tomb indicate not only that Wang wished to surround himself with all the pleasures that he had enjoyed while living, but that he sincerely respected Tang art traditions.   The musicians have the ample proportions, full robes, and elaborate coiffures characteristic of the Tang conception of female beauty, which is said to have originated with the favorite courtesan of the emperor Xuanzong, Yang Guifei (see page 31).   The bodies of the musicians seem to sway with the tempo of the music. Easily identified are the pipe harmonica with a long mouthpiece (next to the conductor), a harp, a  zheng  (a plucked instrument), and a  pipa  (a Chinese lute). One musician also beats a large drum. The artists who sculpted these reliefs had a keen eye for accuracy.   Painted reliefs of this size and quality are rare from this period. Possibly artisans formerly employed in stone sculpture and relief carving at Buddhist sites, who had been displaced by the persecutions ending in A.D. 845, found new employment decorating tomb chambers such as Wang Chuzhi's.       previous    object 20 of 20       Table of Contents                                                   planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2004 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

This region was featured in honor       of Prime Minister Miki, who was born in Tokushima Prefecture, and is       considered the founder of Seattle’s Cherry Blossom Festival.          Performers and artists from this region were brought to the       festival to perform throughout the weekend along side Washington state       performers and visual artists.    “We       decided to invite the Awa Odori group, which originated in Tokushima       prefecture,” Yutaka Sasaki explained.          Prime Minister Miki really liked Awa Odori dance.          He thought it was one of the best dances in the nation and called       it Japan’s samba.    The first       Awa Odori dance troupe visited Seattle in 1982, and came again in 1989.          So, this year, our 20th anniversary, we invited the same dance       troupe.”         Shikoku Island is the smallest of       the four major islands in Japan.    The       name means “four countries,” and consists of four prefectures: Kagawa,       Tokushima, Ehime, and Kochi.    Shikoku       is sparsely populated with high mountains.          The Seto Ohashi Bridge, the world’s longest highway/railway       bridge built in 1988, connects the Shikoku Island to the mainland and is       helping to accelerate the island’s growth.         Artists from Tokushima and Kagawa       were featured guests of the festival.          In addition to the Awa Odori dancers and musicians, the festival       featured a Miki exhibit and Tokushima exhibit consisting of Awa puppet       heads and costumes, children’s art and Tarai Udon (noodle) making.          Tarai Udon, a part of Tokushima life, was prepared by master nookle       makers Akihiro Sakano and Katsuo Katayama.         Also featured at the festival was       Shizuo Okawahara, his son Makoto, and his group from Kagawa, who       demonstrated the art of making Tsutsugaki, hand-dyed banners.         The Miki Exhibit         The late Prime Minister Takeo Miki       of Japan is often seen as the real founder of the Seattle Cherry Blossom       & Japanese Cultural Festival.    Though       he and his family’s life was taken up with the responsibilities of       government, art was an enduring influence.          Madame Miki and the late Prime Minister are well respected artists       in their own right, as well as being well known benefactors to the arts in       general.         In addition to the Awa Odori dance       group, Madame Miki presented and exhibit of calligraphy representing three       generations of the Miki family, together with a photo display.          This exhibit served as a memorial to the man whose ambition was not       limited to leadership in government.          He has left an enduring stamp on the culture of Japan, and the       Festival here is part of his lasting legacy.         Madame Miki is also an acclaimed       potter who has taught at the University of Puget Sound.                         Awa Odori         When the Tokushima Castle was       completed about 1586, in the Tensho Era, Iyemasa, founder of the Hachisuka       Clan allowed the people to do anything they wanted in complete freedom for       a few days.    Released from the       strict social codes of that era, people in the castle town danced for joy.         This story is the most popular       explanation of the origin of the 400 year old Awa dance.          The local lord encouraged Awa dancing to stimulate the local       economy but from time to time he was forced to regulate the dance to keep       the people from getting carried away.          However, the energy of the people never weakened, and they have       continued this traditional dance.         In 1946 the Bon dance in Tokushima       was officially named “Awa Odori” by Koroh Hayashi (1877-1965),       Tokushima City’s first designated Human Cultural Treasure.          Bon is a Buddhist festival to honor the souls of ancestors.          Since 1966, the Awa dance has been held in August.         The Shamisen was originally the       main instrument to accompany Awa dancing but the instrument is difficult       to hear, so other instruments were added.          The present musical accompaniment includes shamisen, three types of       drums, gong and flute.         In Seattle, a new dance group was       formed in honor of the 20th annual Festival.          The Seattle Cherry Blossom Awa Dance Group is composed of local       people interested in learning Awa Odori and sharing it with others in the       community.    Tsutomu Kurokawa,       who first came to Seattle with the Awa Odori group in 1989, taught the       group.    “I would like to see       the Awa Odori group firmly established in this city,” Kurokawa said,       “so that it will continue after I have left.          Mrs. Miki is donating instruments to the Seattle group.          In Tokushima, everybody can dance.          They grow up watching others dance.”          Hanayagi Yosono (Mrs. Mitsuko Ito), Seattle dance teacher, danced       with the new group at the festival.    “This       was my first time to dance awa odori.          Awa odori is different,” she said.          “The timing’s different.    I       like it.”         (Awa puppet leader Minosuke Oe at       Cherry Blossom Festival – Photo by Dean Wong)         Mr. Minosuke Oe: Awa Joruri           Ningyo- Art of Awa Puppet                 Japanese puppetry is recorded as early as       the Heian Period.    It was introduced into Awaji, formerly one of the Tokushima       Prefecture islands, as well.    Hachisuka       Iyemasa, Awa leader during the 15th-16th century encouraged the art which       spread throughout Japan.    The       awa puppet first appeared in Osaka in 1684 and by the early Mejii period       there were as many as 74 puppet theaters documented.          After World War II, only doll makers survived.    Production diminished and only two professional groups have a       complete repertoire now.    Awa       puppet theatre in Osaka eventually evolved as Bunraku and flourished.         Awa and Bunraki puppet makers are       located in Tokushima.    The elder leader of the puppet makers and Tokushima’s       cultural treasure, Mr. Minosuke Oe, is continuing the tradition and was       instrumental in helping resurrect puppet making after the war.          His goal is to get the puppets on stage, not static like those       displayed in museums.    Mr.       Kenji Tada is one of the younger generation puppet makers who visited the       festival as an Awa dancer.         Minosuke Oe has been making       puppets for over thirty years.    “It takes about a month to month and a half to complete a       puppet,” he explained.    “It       takes more time to make a man than a woman – there are more mechanisms       for men.”    Oe is referring       to the various devises which allow the puppeteer to change the puppet’s       expressions.    “If I pull the       string, the eyes will close.    If       the character is angry or mad, you pull the strings for the eyebrows and       the mouth at the same time, and it will show he is angry.          The house maid can stick her tongue out when the master isn’t       looking and the wife character can have horns that come out.”         Shizuo Okawahara:Tsutsugaki       – large hand-dyed ba nners         A special treat at the festival       was the return of Shizuo Okawahara and his son Makoto, who are masters in       the art of “tsutsugaki” textile dyeing.          They are the 6th and 7th generations of a family that has operated       a dye business for nearly 300 years in the city of Takamatsu on the island       of Shikoku.    Shizuo learned       the trade from his father.    Today his son Makoto, a graduate of a prestigious art college       in Kyoto, contributes a modern sensibility to his family and this vital       tradition.           The Okawahara workshop is located       on a narrow and busy street in downtown Takamatsu.          They design and create bold and colorful banners for shops,       shrines, temples, fishing boats and festivals.          They also design and dye futon covers, happi coats and other items       ordered for special occasions.    They       employ a number of different dyeing techniques and are particularly famous       for their work using the method called “tsutsugaki.”          In this technique, a design is traced on the fabric with thin lines       of rice paste that are squeezed out of a cone shaped applicator.          The rice paste serves as a dye resist.          Dye is rubbed onto the fabric which is then immersed in the dye.          Numerous repititions of this process were used to create most of       the work on display at the festival.           The Okawaharas are particularly       famous for the colorful “shishi mai yutan” the large colorful cloth       that is used for the lion dance.    Since Shizuko Okawahara’s first visit in 1979 teaching       “tsutsugaki” at the University of Washington, he has spread knowledge       of his technique to Hawaii and has been on NHK public television.         Okawahara practices his       calligraphy daily by hanging paper in the hallway in his home and writing       each morning.    He finds that       it is difficult to do calligraphy unless he does it daily.          “Calligraphy has to come from your own heart,” he explains.          Okawahara practices in an unusual way.          As he writes, he sings shigin (right), a way of singing Chinese       poems read in Japanese.    He       sang and brushed on large paper the following Li Po poem at the Cherry       Blossom Festival in Seattle.

Index of American Design  1943.8.2654                From the Tour: Textiles from the Index of American Design   Object 11 of 17        Reflecting the English and European fashions during the eighteenth century, printed  cottons of all types were in great demand in America. Most printed textiles of the time  were imported from England, since laws prohibited the manufacture and printing of  fabrics in the colonies. By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the colonists  were defying the English bans, and cottons and linens were being printed openly by  shops in New England and in the mid-Atlantic colonies. Early printed textiles, like this  example, received their patterns through a technique of printing with wood blocks.  A design was cut in high relief on a block of wood. Colored dyes were applied to the  relief design, which was then stamped on the fabric, thus transferring the pattern.  Along with historical scenes based upon American figures and events, floral patterns  were popular. In this late eighteenth-century American printed cotton, the lavish pattern  of brightly colored flowers recalls the elaborate designs of Indian fabrics and of their  European counterparts.                 back to gallery     continue tour                                                           planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2003 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

His first artistic influences came from the canvases of his late great-grandfather, an artist from Spain. Valdez began drawing at age 3. As early as kindergarten, he realized his artistic abilities differed from others. While participating in a mural project at San Antonio’s Esperanza Peace and Justice Center at age 10, Valdez decided art would be his career.  He worked with his mentor, artist/muralist Alex Rubio, on murals around the Alamo City, eventually painting on his own.                       Upon graduating from Burbank High School, Valdez received a full scholarship to the International Fine Arts College in Miami, Fla. After one year, he accepted a full scholarship and transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, R.I., where he completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in illustration. Valdez exhibits and works on commissioned pieces and teaches art to middle school students in San Antonio.

For both murals, Galvez relied on the community for ideas, including images from local photographer Jeff Dunn. In  Crosswinds,  Galvez connects the different elements through clever composition. Poses and facial expressions guide the viewer's eye from one person to the next. For example, an elderly woman seems to smile at the young girl on her father's shoulder in the lower center of the mural. In Galvez's own words, ""I love Central Square. You hear different accents wherever you go, smell different spices in the ethnic restaurants. There's a wonderful multi-cultural spirit here, and I'm trying to capture that.""   Galvez, who makes his home in Oakland, California, studied painting at the California College of Arts and Crafts and San Francisco State University. His large-scale murals, inspired by traditional Mexican mural painting, grace exterior and interior spaces throughout the U.S. His best known works include the 63-foot  Homage to Malcolm X  (1997) in New York City and  Guardians of the Past, Stewards of the Future  (1999), a pair of murals for the U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C."

Oberdorfer and a small group of dedicated neighbors painted a mural of triple-decker houses, very much like the abutting buildings. In 1984, the mural was restored by artist Lisa Carter, who added several figures to the scene.   In 1989 a second large mural was painted by students from Massachusetts College of Art under the supervision of Professor Al Gowan. The mural shows the Rand Estate, which used to be where the shopping center is now.   Finally, in 2000, muralist Joshua Winer turned a remaining 200-foot long stretch of the back wall into a lively neighborhood street scene with houses and gardens. Designed as a response to the character of the North Cambridge neighborhood, the mural references the architectural styles and history of Porter Square, including the area's cattle yards and the famous ""Porterhouse Steak.""

They kick soccer balls, shoot basketballs, collect starfish, cuddle a cat, create chalk drawings on the street, or simply interact with one another.   The tree that stretches across the scene hints at the work's simple yet powerful main message: children ""branch out"" when they play.  They learn about their environment, themselves, and others.  They grow and develop.  In the words of the title, ""play is children's work.""   A Massachusetts resident, Inglese studied at Sarah Lawrence College, at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, and at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  She has received several grants for community-based art workshops in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico.  Her other public works include a 40-foot ceramic mural at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and pieces for numerous schools, recreational facilities, hospitals, transportation centers, libraries, and housing for the elderly.

The children's airplanes, motorcycles, ships, birds, sea creatures, rabbits, and dinosaurs combine with small squares of embedded shapes, numbers and letters. Also in the mix: ceramic ""samplers"" offering assorted bits of familiar childhood advice (""brush your teeth,"" ""say thank you,"" ""eat your spinach"") and nonsense phrases (""liver and onions,"" cats and dogs,"" ""honk if you love noise"").  Background colors unify the diverse elements, while a band running along the bottom lists the student artists' first names.   Gregory and Wye have collaborated on numerous public artworks around New England.  Gregory is a graduate and former teacher in the graphic design department of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.  Wye began her career as a painter, studying in the art students league in New York.  Later, while living in Provincetown, she began creating sculpture in bronze and wood.  She founded Belfast Bay Tilework in 1974, and in 1976 Gregory joined her as a partner. Commissioned through the Cambridge Arts Council's Public Art Program.

GX074-10-1021332	"John Devaney Danehy Park Title:  ""Wheeler Water Garden Mural"" Date:  1998 Materials:  Oil paint on bituminous surface Dimensions:  60' diameter Location:  Sherman Street Entrance In the center of an outdoor amphitheater, a painted frog pond sets the stage for a water-play area, where children can cool off during hot summer days. The challenge that faced Cambridge artist John Devaney in this unusual mural project was to transform a blacktop surface into a realistic looking waterscape with water lilies, fish, frogs, and salamanders.   Devaney studied painting at The New York Studio School of Painting and Sculpture, at Marlboro College in Vermont, and at the Boston University School of Fine Arts. He is well known for his paintings of swimmers. ""Water is a fascinating and challenging environment to paint,"" he explains, ""because of its miraculous offering of weightlessness and suspension."" Funded through a generous donation from Ms. Cornelia Wheeler.     Holly Alderman Danehy Park Title:  ""Hockney by Holly"" Date:  2001 Materials:  Acrylic paint Dimensions:  40' x 30' Location:  Sherman Street Entrance Alderman's mid-summer mural magic was done in bright colors that mimic the narrative style of British painter David Hockney. Alderman describes her painting as a ""superscenic placemaker"" that celebrates the park and reminds the viewer of local history. Depicted in the mural are lush wildflowers, a reflection pool, garden folly, picnic table with umbrella, and many other playful references to the pleasurable uses of Danehy Park.   Alderman studied art and architecture at Harvard University and graduated magna cum laude in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. She has taught at Buckingham Browne and Nichols School and Williston-Northampton School and painted several murals in the Greater Boston area.    Commissioned by the City of Cambridge through the Human Services Program."

This       project was intended to  bring children closer together , to create       an environment that fosters  communication and understanding  between        cultures , and to ultimately, through their own experiences, learn  respect       for one another . We define children as  ages 2  through  18!         The other major goal of this project was to       show kids  how to have fun  outside of the classroom or       home, and to provide them with ""space of their own..."" there is       something about a big piece of white canvas that children find inviting       and challenging!!!         To begin  with, the children should       choose a theme. Remember, there are the  Multicultural Diversity Mile ,       The  Environmental Mile,  and the  Indigenous Peoples Mile .       Some groups like to plan and design a mural ahead of time, and some rely       on the spontaneity of the children. That will be entirely up to you and       your group. We recommend consulting with the children themselves. It will       be great if you can also let them know that whatever they do will be seen  world       wide  and that  their work will represent their school, organization,       town, state, AND country.                 The only  rules  we require that you       adhere to are  1)  that children cannot paint over someone else's       work and  2)  that adults resist the temptation to draw anything on       the mural for the kids. The integrity of the mural for the  Guinness       Book of World Records  is to ensure that children completed the work.       With that in mind, we will require either photos of       children/work-in-progress and they should sign their names on the back       with permanent markers. If that isn't possible, a statement signed by two       adult witnesses that children exclusively created this work would be       required. We will also request the group (individually and/or group) sign       a release form acknowledging that by participating in this project, their       work will be publicized, as well as any photos of the children working, or       of the murals and parts thereof may be used for news articles, stories, or       publication or other media events.         We also ask that you  be cheerful and       supportive when the children are working . It's really up to you,       whether you are the coach, an art teacher, a group leader, a Mom or Dad,       or just a person who loves kids, to make their environment a happy and       positive one.                                                                        Getting  Started                                                                                                   Materials Needed:                   5 foot by 12-foot piece of cotton           canvas  light or medium weight            The canvas should be primed or a base coat applied with gesso or flat           white water-base acrylic indoor wall paint. (1/2 gallon of gesso, but           1 gallon of flat white wall paint will cover 3 canvasses!)                           Inexpensive acrylic paints  work           as well as expensive ones, so look for those sales and bargains when           buying paint. You will need:                                        2 eight-ounce bottles of black            2 eight-ounce bottles of white            2 eight-ounce bottles of primary colors            (red, yellow, green & blue)            6-8 two-ounce bottles of various colors your choice            (sold in art/hobby stores)                                     paper cups to be used for water ...only           fill them 1/4 full to keep the spills down                           small Styrofoam paper plates  to           use as palettes                           brushes                           2 buckets  or pails of water (1           for clean water, 1 to put brushes in)                           paper towels                           a large 12X18 plastic tarp  or           floor cover                                                                                Making                  it Work                                                                                       Lay down the  two ground rules  -           1) can't paint over someone else's work AND 2) no adults.                       Remind them to take their time and           remember this is an important project.                       Children can sketch in pencil and then           start painting if they like.                       They should decide ahead of time if the           design is one directional (like looking at a drawing from left to           right, or if their design will be all around the canvas and           multi-directional.                       Logos and emblems are encouraged and           allowed, but should not be the focal point of the design.                       We usually ask an adult to squeeze small           amounts of paint onto the pallets to prevent waste and to share           palettes that still have unused paint.                       Children are encouraged to use sponges           and other materials to texturize if they wish...let their creative           juices flow!                 Other hints:                    After the painting is finished they can           outline if they like...on large murals, outlining with a marker or           black paint makes their design stand out more.                           Tell them that they should put their           used brushes in the dirty brush bucket or wash them and that when they           are finished, they will be expected to clean up any spills, throw           paper towels in trash, and wash their hands and clean up the sink when           finished and of course, PLEASE no running and playing with paint!                           Ask children to remove their shoes so           they can sit on the floor.  (when paint gets on socks they can           wash them, but shoes will track paint and the shoes should be placed           out of the way against a wall so people don't trip over them).                                                                                Project  Registration                                                                             Organizers of the project should contact       one of the organizations listed below to register your mural for the       project and to seek any further assistance you may need.

GX073-97-3194453	"Daniel Galvez Pearl Street Parking Garage Title:  Crossroads  Date:  1986 Materials:  Enamel on concrete Dimensions:  28' x 46' Location:  Intersection of Pearl and Franklin Streets, facing Pearl Street. ""I see murals as a means for people to reclaim their environment and express what is important to them, and to focus on the life energies of the community. Murals are an attempt to create a vital art connected to the deepest needs of the people. The walls become a platform for the people to speak out about who they are."" - Daniel Galvez   Residents, special festivals, everyday life...the spirit of a community has been captured in this vibrant, larger-than-life mural. Daniel Galvez conceived  Crossroads  as a family portrait of Central Square and he relied on the neighborhood's ""family"" to help create it.  He invited community members to share ideas, contribute photographs and even assist in painting the mural.   The figures in the mural are based on real people. Who do you see? What are they doing? Which people do you notice first?   From Galvez's perspective, what kind of place is Central Square? How does color contribute to the overall feeling of the piece?   Stand in front of the mural and compare your size with the figures. Why are they so big?   Galvez painted this mural in 1986. As you walk around Central Square today, do you think the neighborhood has changed?   In collaborating with Galvez, residents talked about what they value in their community. How does the mural represent these values?    Why do you think the artist titled this mural  Crossroads?       What you will need:  Notebook or paper, pen or pencil.   Imagine that one of the people in the mural comes to life. Write in the character's voice. What would he or she say about Central Square?     What you will need:  Paper, pencil, glue, paint, crayons. Many artists use real-life people as their inspiration. Some artists use models and work directly from life, while others rely on photographs.   Collect photographs of people in your family, school or neighborhood. Now cut your paper in a variety of shapes and sizes. On each piece draw a picture of someone, using the photographs for inspiration. Add drawings of other objects if you wish.   Now arrange these small portraits on a larger piece of paper - make a community or family portrait. When you find an arrangement that you like, glue your drawings to the piece of paper. Add color to your piece with paints, crayon or colored pencil.    What you will need:  Large piece of white paper (22"" x 30"" or bigger), pencil, ruler, color pastels, paint, crayons.   We will explore one way in which a muralist (an artist who paints directly on a wall) translates a sketch into a wall-sized image. Download and print out the detail from the Galvez mural. Use your ruler to measure the image and create an evenly spaced grid system across it.   Now create another grid pattern with the same number of squares on the large piece of paper. This grid will be much larger because you should only draw the same number of squares as you did on the smaller paper.   Go grid square by grid square. For example, look at the upper left-hand square of the smaller image. Copy what you see in that square into the upper left-hand square of the large grid. Continue in this manner until all the squares in the large paper have been sketched in. Use color to complete your mural."
GX073-97-11809204	"Bernard LaCasse 727 Memorial Drive Title:   Beat the Belt  Date:   1980 Materials:   Acrylic on masonry  Dimensions:  13' x 75' ""It took from 1963 to 1968 to get the entire city to support us in stopping the highway. It was a full time job with weekly meetings. The first full public meeting was at St. Mary's on Norfolk St. Six hundred people were there. Frank McCann, one of our state representatives, got up and said, 'You can't beat City Hall; you can't stop the bulldozers. This is progress.' I got up and pointed my finger at him--I had never spoken in public in my life--and said, 'Not only can you fight City Hall, but you can win....'"" Asti Greene Benfield,  activist represented in mural What's going on in this mural? This is a neighborhood drama. Who are the different characters?    The ""Inner Belt"" was a proposed eight-lane highway that would have run right through the neighborhood of Cambridgeport. Local residents battled the highway for 20 years before winning the fight in 1970. Bernie LaCasse's mural commemorates this moment of triumph, celebrating the power of ordinary people to make a difference.    Notice the size of the various figures. How has the artist used scale to explain this event?    What moment in the story does LaCasse show? What is the mood of the protesters? Who has the power? How can you tell?    As you stand in front of this mural, think about your physical relationship to it. How does the artist include you, the viewer?    What colors has the artist used in the mural? Why do you think he chose them?     What you will need:  Paper, pencil or black marker.    Using pencil or marker, sketch the composition of the mural, paying close attention to the size of the figures in the piece relative to the bulldozer. Reverse the scale on another piece of paper, making the bulldozer large and the people small. How does this change the feeling of the piece?     What you will need: Roll of paper, 8.5"" x 11""pieces of paper, charcoal, pencil, paint, tape, scissors.     Muralists who choose a political event as their subject make many decisions as they communicate their ideas on a very large surface. In LaCasse's  Beat the Belt,  the size of the figures makes a statement about power and community.   Play with this idea of relative scale. Make a series of very large (larger than life) drawings of people. You can trace some friends' bodies on the large roll of paper. Cut out the figures and tape them on a wall. Now make similar drawings, but at a much smaller size (use the 8.5"" x 11"" paper). Put these drawings on the wall. Compare the impact of these two sets of images.    What you will need:  Cardboard, a piece of wood or dowel, drawing or painting materials (pens, pencils, pastels, crayons, paints).   Can you think of other artworks that have been inspired by a political event? Look at the image Pablo Picasso's  Guernica.   What is this work trying to say?       Start a collection of images that are political in nature. These can be from magazines, postcards, newspapers, etc. Now think of a situation in the world that you feel is unjust. This situation could be something affecting your friends, family, school, neighborhood, country or even the whole world. Create a sign or piece of art that expresses what you want to say."
GX063-15-14736584	"Hispanic    RR Home  >>  Hispanic    Division  >>  About    Hispanic RR  >> Coat of Arms        Columbus' Coat of Arms        At the time of the dedication of the Hispanic Room, the mural adorning its    south wall, depicting the coat of arms of Christopher Columbus and following    a broad design developed by the architect of the room, Paul Philippe Cret, had    not yet been commissioned. After deciding on the overall design for the mural    and giving much consideration to the techniques with which it could be executed,    Cret became interested in the use of stainless steel. His interest became known    to the executives of the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. of Pittsburgh, Pa., who    saw in the project not only the opportunity to experiment with the use of stainless    steel but also the chance to contribute to better inter-American understanding.    They therefore generously offered not only to provide the steel for the mural    but to provide the artist to paint it. The gift, an unusual gesture of Latin    American friendship on the part of a group of U.S. businessmen, was dedicated    on May 27, 1940.   At the time of its dedication, the work was said to be the first example of    a mural on steel in any building. In preparing it, the steel was incised in    all those sections that were to be covered by paint, and the paint itself, which    was oil based, was applied in several coats, after which the whole was covered    with a protective varnish. The basic advantages of this medium were that it    offered a surface that could be detached and moved at will and that backgrounds    of extreme brilliance would be achieved.   The artist commissioned for the project by Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. executives    was Mrs. Buell Mullen of Chicago. Mrs. Mullen had previously painted portraits    of various public figures and musicians on metal and had also decorated specially    designed trains for the Chicago Burlington and Missouri Pacific railroads.   The focal point of the mural is a large shield representing the coat of arms    itself. When the King and Queen ennobled Columbus, the symbols they chose spoke    of the high esteem in which they held him. For the first and second quarter    of his blazon they granted him nothing less than the royal arms of Castille    and León, the castle and the lion; his third quarter was to be ""a few islands    and sea-waves,"" and the last ""your arms which you used to wear."" In that Columbus'    family had been one of manual laborers, the words ""used to wear"" have led to    much speculation and debate. Still it was not unusual for commoners to claim    affiliation, either real or fanciful, to a blazon-bearing family, and there    is evidence that, as an admiral, Columbus did just that.   Under circumstances that have never been fully explained, Columbus altered    the original royal instructions by filling the fourth quarter, not with the    colors that ""he used to wear,"" but with the five anchors found on the blazon    of the Admiral of Castille. The royal instructions had been to place ""his"" arms    last, in the fourth quarter. These he relegated to a fifth division, implying    perhaps the merely formal nature of his claim to them.   In the artist's rendering of the coat of arms, one finds, at the lower extremity,    a blue band diagonally crossing a field of gold and surmounted by a cap of red    -- symbols from the Columbus family's original coat of arms. Above that and    to the right are the five anchors Columbus added to the design granted by the    King and Queen, and, to the left, golden isles resting on a silver and azure    sea. At the top of the shield and to the right is the symbol of León. For the    mural, the lion has been rendered in burgundy, though the original designated    color was purple. To its left is a golden castle, representing the second of    the two kingdoms united under Isabel. This lies on a field of green, corresponding    to the instructions of the original decree of Ferdinand and Isabel, rather than    the red subsequently mandated by Charles the Fifth.   Above the shield the artist has placed the words "" Por Castilla y por León ,""    and below it the words "" Nuevo mundo halló Colón "" [For Castille and    for León, Columbus found a new world], a slight variation of a slogan added    to the coat of arms by the descendants of Columbus. Completing the design, green    and blue scrolls have been placed in the right- and left-hand fields of the    mural, and a geometrical band of leaves serves as an outer border.

GX057-54-6349044	Although vandalism of public art is almost unheard                of in Cambridge, outdoor sculptures and murals are vulnerable to                the weather and air pollution. In 1996, CAC initiated a Conservation                and Maintenance Program to provide consistent professional care                for its collection. Following an assessment of each artwork, the                sculptures and murals most urgently in need of repairs were promptly                restored. Art conservators now provide ongoing maintenance to ensure                that any damage is rectified in a timely and professional manner.                They monitor the collection, develop annual treatment plans, and                supervise interns and technicians in cleaning the artworks as needed.                Conservators also provide artists with advice on materials, construction                techniques, and preventative measures for new public artworks. The                program was a First Place winner of the Save Outdoor Sculpture!                national 1998 Achievement Award.                                                                                                                                                                          The Cambridge Arts Council is pleased to announce the availability                of a new publication,  Conservation and Maintenance of Contemporary                Public Art,  published by Archetype Publication Ltd. This resource,                edited by Arts Council employee Hafthor Yngvason, brings together                27 papers presented at an international conference on contemporary                public art conservation organized by the Arts Council in October                2001. The publication features essays by some of the most renowned                artists, administrators, critics and conservators working in the                field of public art and highlights the City's Public Art Conservation                and Maintenance program as well as several prominent public artworks                contained in the City's collection.                The book is available through the  Americans                for the Arts bookstore  in the public art section.                                                                                                                                                                                  A decade after its installation in Canal Park,  William Wainwright's                Nevergreen Tree (1987)  had turned gray and lifeless, betrayed                by the natural elements that it was created to celebrate. The mylar-covered                leaves, designed to move gently in the wind and deflect sunrays                into prismatic light, had cracked in the hot sun and with sharp                changes in temperature. After restoration, the sculpture has regained                its former luster, the reflective surfaces shooting rays of colorful                light in all directions.                                                            In the 23 years since it was painted,  Ellary's  mural on the Inman Square Firehouse  had become an enduring feature in a changing neighborhood and a celebrated memorial to firefighters.  Over the same period the colors faded and the paint started peeling.  The mural was restored in 1999 and rededicated with appropriate grandeur at the Cambridge Fire Department's Annual  Medal Day.

In a second phase of the commission, Ruscha designed sixty related lunettes (moon-shaped paintings) for placement throughout the library's two floors. The backgrounds of the lunettes are painted black, white, and gray, contributing to a unifying theme reflecting the spirit of black ink printed on white paper. These works contain provocative and whimsical bits of language, serving to stimulate library users' thoughts about the nature of language and linguistics.

GX031-59-0160908	"""Descent Into the  Chasm"" by Pat Rawlings. In this painting made for the Advanced Space  Exploration Program, parachutes are being used to abruptly slow  the first Mars expedition vehicle's descent to the planet's surface.  Since Mars has an atmosphere (though thin), this was thought possible.  The destination depicted is the floor of Ganges Chasma.                      Members of the military  are frequently talented artists. This painting by Sgt. First Class  Peter G. Varisano of the U.S. Army shows the 101st during Operation  Desert Storm.                     Reality can often  be as beautiful as imagination. In this photo, taken by NASA's Hubble  Space Telescope on July 3, 2002, glowing gaseous streamers of red,  white, and blue - as well as green and pink - illuminate the heavens  like Fourth of July fireworks. The colorful streamers that float  across the sky in this photo were created by one of the biggest  firecrackers seen to go off in our galaxy in recorded history, the  titanic supernova explosion of a massive star.                     An aviation artist  must have a thorough understanding of the structure of the airplane  being painted.                     Aviation artist Keith  Ferris applies the final detail on his painting Global Workhorse.  The painting depicts a C-17 of the 437th Airlift Wing departing  the former MiG base at Tuzla, Bosnia. Keith flew nine of these C-17  missions to Tuzla and Sarajevo in eight days during the build up  of US forces in Bosnia in January 1996. The painting was presented  by then McDonnell Douglas to the U. S. Air Force Art Collection.  The leather covered vertical drawing board emulates an easel while  providing close access to the painting and a good surface for the  taping of necessary reference material.                     American artist Norman  Rockwell created a series of painting on the Four Freedoms theme  after hearing President Franklin Roosevelt's inspiring ""Four Freedoms""  speech on January 6, 1941. This painting focuses on freedom of speech  and urges Americans to buy War Bonds. Although the Government initially  rejected Rockwell`s offer to create these paintings on the Four  Freedoms theme, the images were publicly circulated when The Saturday  Evening Post, one of the nation`s most popular magazines, commissioned  and reproduced the paintings. After winning public approval, the  paintings served as the centerpiece of a massive U.S. war bond drive  and were put into service to help explain the war's aims.                         Aviation and Space Art in the 20th Century              Artists have depicted human flight for centuries, long before  a hot-air balloon would carry a human passenger in  1783   or the Wright brothers would successfully fly their airplane  in  1903 . At the end  of the 15 th  century ,  Leonardo da Vinci , the Renaissance artist, inventor, and inspired  genius, created detailed sketches of a flying machine with wings  like a bat. And illustrators created woodcuts and drawings of  the early balloon flights. However, aviation and space travel  would not be a significant presence in art until the 20 th   century.       The popular press of the late 19 th  and early 20 th   centuries drove the demand for aviation art. Images of  airships  and  airplanes  sold books and magazines.  Stories of  World  War I dogfights , which were more exciting when illustrated,  increased aviation art's popularity even more. Photography began  to compete with illustration for a place in the press after 1888  and the invention of roll film by George Eastman but could not  compete when it came to pure beauty. Unlike early 20 th -century  photography, illustrations were done in color. Artists could paint  imaginary situations, depict scenes that would be difficult or  dangerous to photograph, embellish a situation, change the landscape,  or add dramatic lighting.        Artists became an invaluable part of the domestic war effort  during World War II. Photography documented the war, but it was  artists who rallied people through patriotic magazine covers,  ads, and posters. ""For All the Brave,"" a poster for U.S. War Bonds,  focused on a pilot's determined face as he races to his fighter.  The Army Air Service had its own line of rousing recruitment posters.  ""Keep Em Flying,"" painted in 1942 by Dan V. Smith, featured a  formation of bombers set against pastel clouds and a rippling  U.S. flag. Warm, muted colors (the dark brown of a well-worn leather  fighter jacket, the deep red on the U.S. flag) emphasized the  seriousness of the subject matter, but dynamic lines and shapes  (the strong wings of a fighter jet against roiling clouds) also  made this art exciting and attractive.       While some artists were supporting the war effort from the sidelines,  others were witnesses to the horrors of war, and their art reflects  this experience. On April 27, 1937, during the  Spanish Civil War,  Nazi German bombers  and air fighters reduced the Spanish town of Guernica to rubble,  killing or wounding more than 1,600 civilians, at the request  of General Francisco Franco, the leader of a fascist coup that  had plunged Spain into civil war. Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), Spain's  most prominent artist, captured the violence and carnage in a  mural simply entitled "" Guernica .""  Although the painting makes no direct reference to the bombing,  the fractured bodies and screaming faces, painted almost entirely  in black, white, and gray in the angular ""Cubist"" style that Picasso  made famous, clearly expresses the fear and pain of the event  and makes a strong anti-war statement. Henry Moore (1898-1986)  sketched his fellow Londoners taking refuge in underground train  stations during the  German  air bombing raids  of 1940. These haunting pictures, rendered  mostly in browns and white, depict people huddled together in  a jumble of bodies. The sketches were so popular with the British  audience that the British government hired him to be an official  war artist in 1940.       Despite the changes that aviation has gone through in the intervening  decades, World War II airplanes and combat continue to be the  mainstay of aviation art. Today's aviation art even tends to follow  the look created by World War II artists. Keith Ferris creates  an almost romantic feel for his paintings by setting his airplanes  against pastel skies and large banks of clouds that come straight  out of war-era posters. In his mural of  Boeing B-17 bombers  (""Fortresses Under  Fire""), located at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington,  D.C., dozens of white contrails ripple across a soft blue sky  while pale rays of sunshine glint off the metal. Keith Woodcock  favors subdued colors and golden-hued sunsets reminiscent of the  color pallets popular during the 1940s. Stan Stokes prefers bolder  colors, but like aviation artists since the 1940s, composes his  paintings on the diagonal, creating dynamic movement by pointing  the airplane's cross shape, wings running perpendicular to the  body, toward one of the canvas' corners.        Paintings of modern aircraft even follow old-fashioned style  conventions. In Woodcock's ""Woodland Predator,"" a Harrier hovers  above the ground in a mist-shrouded forest. Ferris' Boeing E-6  jet (""The Vital Link"") stealthily blends with the clouds, its  wings echoing the rectangular shape of the canvas. In these artists'  hands, flight technology is poetry in motion and the lethal shape  of a fighter becomes beautiful.       While some artists have depicted aeronautic fact, a growing group  of artists have been depicting our aerospace future. The science  fiction magazines, like  Amazing Stories  and  Air Wonder Stories ,  that emerged before World War II were cheaply produced but attracted  talented artists and developed an audience for space-based art.  Up until the 1950s, this space art usually looked like aviation  art, with rocket ships resembling the  V-2 rockets  manufactured  by the Germans from 1944 to 1945, long and tapered, with a pointed  noise and small stability fins, racing diagonally across the picture.  Battles between warring spacecraft looked suspiciously like dogfights  between fighter planes, only with aliens substituting for enemy  pilots.       Space art finally found its own look in the 1950s as the space  race between the United States and the Soviet Union was heating  up and science fiction began shifting to science fact. Chesley  Bonestell (1888-1986) created a series for  Collier's  called  ""The Conquest of Space"" that broke away from the romantic look  of previous space and aviation art. In ""Assembling the Space Glider""  (1956), a chevron-shaped glider is partially silhouetted against  the blue of Earth while pressure-suited crews work around it.  The painting is dark, composed almost entirely of black and various  shades of blue, and occupied by crisp shapes either echoing or  contrasting with the curved outline of Earth in the background.  "" Saturn Seen From Titan ""  (1949), perhaps his most famous painting, depicts the glowing  outline of Saturn overtop dark, craggy rock formations. Bonestell's  art had a startling realism never before seen in the genre, making  it easy for the viewer to believe that this was a glimpse of humanity's  future in space.        Other artists followed in Bonestell's footsteps, like Robert  McCall, who first came to public attention with his illustrations  for ""America's Giant Jump into Space,"" featured in  Life   in 1964. McCall's heroic murals are on permanent display at NASA's  Johnson Space Center in Houston, the National Air and Space Museum,  Disney's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida, and the Pentagon. His  painting ""Orion Leaving Space Station,"" showing a space vehicle  darting from the lit bay of a wheel-shaped space station, was  used for the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" movie poster.               Today's space art takes inspiration from  photographs            returned from Galileo  and other planetary missions. Bonestell rendered            space in flat blacks and pale colors, reflecting images taken from the            optical astronomy of his day. ""Exploring Mars"" shows a small team conducting            work on a yellowish, smooth Martian terrain. The  Sojourner Rover , activated            in 1997, has since proven that Mars really is the red planet through            photos of taken from its rocky surface. The  Hubble            Space Telescope  (HST), deployed in 1990, has given us colorful photos            that both drop's on and defy our past understanding of celestial objects.            Although HST's photographs are false tinted, with colors used to distinguish            different gases and chemicals, they reveal that the space between stars            and planets is not empty. Artists, like Pat Rawlings, Bob Eggleton,            and Lynette Cook, have embraced this information, creating canvases            that burst with color, dynamic shapes, and action.               Space art has become a mature art form, with its own unique look and audience.            It even boasts an insider. Alan Bean, the pilot of the  Apollo 12 Lunar Module  and the fourth            man to walk on the Moon, depicts the beauty and excitement of space            travel from the point of view of someone who has been there.        Understanding the emotional power of space art, the NASA Art  Program commissions artists like Bean to document the history  of the space program, both crewed and uncrewed missions of the  past, present, and future. The collection of more than 800 works,  which also includes artists not usually associated with space,  like Andy Warhol (1928-1987) and Jamie Wyeth, can be viewed at  NASA centers, museums, and galleries around the United States.  Furthermore, the Program has donated more than 2,000 works to  the National Air and Space Museum.       Another tool of the modern era, the Internet, has permanently  changed space and aviation art. Both have spent decades as specialty  art forms whose main audiences have been reached through books  and periodicals. Most fans could never own a frameable version  of their favorite picture. Now Internet-based galleries have provided  a new market for talented artists, both professional and hobbyists,  while giving fans access to originals and high-quality reproductions.  Aviation and space art are now getting the exposure they deserve  and increased recognition as true and beautiful art forms.       -Anne Simmons       References and Further Reading:   Ballantine, Ian (ed.).

For 97 years the Library was housed in various            locations within the Capitol Building. The first separate Library of            Congress Building, known today as the Thomas Jefferson Building, was            suggested by Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford in 1871,            authorized in 1886, and finally completed in 1897.                                  The          grandiose entrance stairs and facade of the west side of the Jefferson          Building  reflect the nationalistic ambitions of the Library's planners,          architects, and builders.

Highsmith)                     When its doors were opened to the public on November 1, 1897, the new          Library of Congress building was an unparalleled national achievement;          its 23-carat gold-plated dome capped the ""largest, costliest, and safest""          library building in the world. Its elaborately decorated facade and interior,          for which more than forty American painters and sculptors produced commissioned          works of art, were designed to show how the United States could surpass          European libraries in grandeur and devotion to classical culture and to          inspire optimism about America's future. A contemporary guidebook boasted:          ""America is justly proud of this gorgeous and palatial monument to its          National sympathy and appreciation of Literature, Science, and Art. It          has been designed and executed solely by American art and American labor          (and is) a fitting tribute for the great thoughts of generations past,          present, and to be."" This new national Temple of the Arts immediately          met with overwhelming approval from the American public.            Known as the Library of Congress (or Main) Building until June 13,            1980, when it was named for Thomas Jefferson, the Library's principal            founder, the structure was built specifically to serve as the American            national library, and its architecture and decoration express and enhance            that grand purpose. The elaborate entrance pavilion and Great Hall gradually            lead to the central reading room where, properly prepared, the user            can take full advantage of the Library's vast resources of knowledge            and information. A national library for the United States was the dream            and goal of Librarian Spofford; the new building was a crucial step            in his achievement. It was a functional, state-of-the-art structure            as well as a monument to American cultural nationalism, for it used            and celebrated the latest technology to demonstrate the new role of            the library as an efficient workshop.                                  Pompeiian          panels depicting FORTITUDE and JUSTICE  flank the window at the east          end of the Great Hall's second-floor North Corridor. The artist is George          Maynard.                     The early years of planning and construction were filled with controversy          and delay. After two design competitions and a decade of debate about          design and location, in 1886 Congress finally chose a plan in the Italian          Renaissance style submitted by Washington architects John L. Smithmeyer          and Paul J. Pelz. Structurally the architects followed the basic idea          proposed by Librarian Spofford: a circular, domed reading room at the          Library's center, surrounded by ample space for the Library's various          departments. In the final Smithmeyer & Pelz plan, the reading room was          enclosed by rectangular exterior walls, which divided the open space into          four courtyards. The corner pavilions were devoted to the departments          and to exhibit space.                                Floor Plan of the first floor of the Thomas Jefferson          Building             Floor Plan of the second floor of the Thomas            Jefferson Building                               Disputes continued after the building was authorized in 1886. Responsibility          for clearing the site was debated (several buildings had to be razed)          and Capitol landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted protested the building's          location because it shut out ""the whole view of the Capitol building from          Pennsylvania Avenue--the main approach from Capitol hill."" Another controversy,          this one about the selection of the proper cement for the foundation,          proved to be architect Smithmeyer's undoing, and he was dismissed in 1888.          The building's construction was placed under the direction of Brig. Gen.          Thomas Lincoln Casey, Chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey          and his Superintendent of Construction, civil engineer Bernard R. Green,          had successfully completed the construction of the Washington Monument          and the State, War, and Navy (now Old Executive Office) Building and were          trusted by Congress. The cornerstone was laid on Aug. 28, 1890. Paul J.          Pelz, who replaced Smithmeyer as architect in 1888, was himself dismissed          in 1892 and replaced by architect Edward Pearce Casey, General Casey's          son, who supervised most of the interior decoration.                                  Plaque          on First Street S.E. in front of the Jefferson Building.  The Library          of Congress seal is above the inscription. The Jefferson Building acquired          its name in 1980.                     The building's elaborate decoration, which combines sculpture, mural painting,          and architecture on a scale unsurpassed in any American public building,          was possible only because General Casey and Bernard Green lived up to          their reputations as efficient construction engineers, completing the          building for a sum substantially less than that appropriated by Congress.          When it became apparent in 1892 that funds for ""artistic enrichment"" would          be available out of the original appropriation, Casey and Green seized          the opportunity and turned an already remarkable building into a cultural          monument.            The two engineers were infused with a nationalism that complemented            Spofford's national library aspirations. The 1893 World's Columbian            Exposition in Chicago provided General Casey, his architect son Edward,            and Bernard Green with an example of a cooperative artistic endeavor            that combined architecture, sculpture, and painting, and there are many            similarities and parallels between the Chicago Exposition and the Library            building. Both are artistic ventures on a massive scale and, for the            most part, in the same Beaux-Arts design tradition. Many of the artists            who contributed works to the Library building either helped design the            imperial facades of the Chicago Exposition or exhibited their works            within its pavilions; moreover, many of them repeated the idealistic            themes and togaed likenesses they produced in Chicago.            General Casey and Bernard Green were anxious to give American artists            an opportunity to display their talents, and ultimately they commissioned            no less than forty-two American sculptors and painters ""to fully and            consistently carry out the monumental design and purpose of the building.""            Casey and Green exercised final approval over the words and images seen            throughout the building, even though the names, inscriptions, and quotations            were chosen by many different people.            The works of art were expected to address various areas of human achievement            without getting into controversial areas such as politics and religion.            The sculptors were assigned general themes, but the muralists, with            guidance from the two engineers and Edward Pearce Casey, chose their            own themes and, it appears, most of the inscriptions and quotations            within their assigned areas. Librarian Spofford chose the authors (his            favorites) who are portrayed in the nine busts in the portico above            the front entrance, and the quotations in the Pavilion of Seals (the            Northeast Pavilion). He also chose the figures portrayed in the sixteen            portrait statues on the balustrade of the Main Reading Room and, in            all likelihood, the quotations in the four corridors on the second floor            of the Great Hall. Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University,            chose the inscriptions above the eight symbolic statues in the Main            Reading Room, and provided the Caseys and Bernard Green with advice            about other inscriptions and decorative features.            In a report to Congress in 1896, Superintendent Green stated that            the total cost of the mural and decorative painting, the sculpture,            and the three massive bronze doors at the main entrance was $364,000.            Even with the additional costs of gilding the building's dome, including            the Torch of Learning at its apex, and the construction of the Neptune            Fountain in front of the building on First Street, the building was            completed for $200,000 less than the total congressional authorization            of approximately $6,500,000.            Weather and the chemical effects of the 19th century method of tinning            the copper beneath the gold leaf dome combined to produce perforations            in the copper in the 20th century, and the leaking gilded copper was            replaced in October 1931. It was thought that gold leaf would conflict            with the appearance of the building's aging granite exterior, and the            new copper was left to acquire its current patina. In August 1993, however,            the flame of the Torch of Learning at the apex of the dome was regilded,            this time time with 23 1/2 carat gold leaf.            Since 1897, three of the four interior courtyards of the Jefferson            Building have been filled. The east courtyards have become bookstacks;            the southeast bookstack was completed in 1910, the northeast in 1927.            The northwest courtyard is occupied by two special structures: the Coolidge            Auditorium, built in 1925 for chamber music recitals and a gift of Elizabeth            Sprague Coolidge, and the Whittall Pavilion, given to the Library in            1938 by Gertrude Clarke Whittall to house five Stradivarius instruments            she donated to the Library. A plaque commemorating Mrs. Coolidge and            her gift is outside the entrance to the Coolidge Auditorium, on the            ground floor. The names of four great composers--Mozart, Beethoven,            Schubert, Brahms--are inscribed on the outside wall of the Whittall            Pavilion, above the windows and the stairs leading down to the interior            courtyard.            The east side of the Jefferson Building was extended between 1929            and 1933, providing space for a Rare Book Room, a Union Catalog Room,            and additional study rooms.            In 1924 a marble and bronze exhibit case known as the Shrine, designed            by architect Francis Bacon, was installed on the west side of the second            floor gallery in the Great Hall. There the Declaration of Independence            and the Constitution of the United States were displayed until 1952            when the documents were transferred to the National Archives. As part            of the restoration that began in 1986, the empty Shrine was removed            from the Great Hall and placed into storage.            The Main Reading Room was closed for renovation and the installation            of air conditioning on May 4, 1964, reopening on August 16, 1965. In            1984, Congress appropriated $81.5 million for the renovation and restoration            of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings, which included the cleaning and            conservation of murals in the Jefferson Building. Work started in 1986            and was completed in 1995.            The Jefferson Building is a heroic setting for a national institution.            Today it is recognized as a unique blending of art and architecture,            a structure that celebrates learning, nationalism, and American turn-of-the-century            confidence and optimism. The Jefferson Building also reflects its own            time and prejudices. It emphasizes the achievements of western civilization,            and most of the names and images on its walls evoke a society dominated            by western thought. Thus, for many different reasons, the elaborate            embellishment of the Jefferson Building is worth careful attention.            The building is celebratory, inspirational, and educational. Few structures            represent human aspiration in such dramatic fashion.                                THE WEST FRONT EXTERIOR                     The Neptune Fountain          This lavishly ornamental fountain, created by sculptor Roland Hinton Perry,          represents a scene in the court of Neptune, the Roman god of the sea.          The muscular and majestic Neptune, with his long flowing beard, is seated          on a bank of rocks. The figure is of colossal size; if standing, it would          be about twelve feet in height. On each side of Neptune lolls a figure          of Triton, one of the minor sea gods, blowing a conch shell to summon          the water deities to Neptune's throne. Sea nymphs, sea horses, sea monsters,          gigantic frogs, and huge turtles are part of this extraordinary and splendid          grotto of the sea. Hinton's name and the date he completed the work are          inscribed to the right of Neptune, at the fountain's water level.                                           The Ethnological Heads          One of the Jefferson Building's most striking exterior features are the          thirty-three ethnological heads that surround it, serving as keystone          ornaments of the first story windows. Otis T. Mason, curator of the Department          of Ethnology in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution,          was the special advisor for this project. In Herbert Small's 1897  Handbook          of the New Library of Congress , this undertaking is described as          ""the first instance of a comprehensive attempt to make ethnological science          contribute to the architectural decoration of an important public building.""          The heads themselves, created by William Boyd and Henry Jackson Ellicott,          were based on information provided by Professor Mason. The list of the          races represented, as described by Small, and the location of the keystones          follow.            Starting at the north end of the front entrance pavilion, the first            head is that of a Russian Slav, located beneath the portico bust of            Demosthenes. Continuing across the west front, the heads are: Blonde            European; Brunette European; Modern Greek; Persian (Iranian);            On the south side: Circassian; Hindu; Hungarian (Magyar); Semite,            or Jew; Arab (Bedouin); Turk            On the east side: Modern Egyptian (Hamite); Abyssinian; Malay; Polynesian;            Australian; Negrito (Indian Archipeligo); Sudan Negro; Akka (Dwarf African            Negro); Fuegian; Botocudo (South America); Pueblo Indian (Zunis of New            Mexico);            On the north side: Esquimaux; Plains Indians (Sioux, Cheyenne, Comanche);            Samoyede (Finn); Korean; Japanese; Ainu (northern Japan);            On the west front: Burman; Tibetan; Chinese                                           The Portico Busts          In the portico of the Jefferson Building's front entrance pavilion--at          second story window level--nine great men are commemorated by busts. Benjamin          Franklin was placed in the center of this grouping, because he was considered          by the sculptor Frederick Wellington Ruckstuhl to be ""one of the greatest          men of this country, and as a writer and philosopher the patriarch."" Each          last name is inscribed at the base of the bust. Franklin and the eight          others who were so enshrined are listed below, along with the name of          the sculptors of each bust.             North end of portico:            DEMOSTHENES, by Herbert Adams             Across the front (left to right)            EMERSON, by Jonathan Scott Hartley            IRVING, by Jonathan Scott Hartley            GOETHE, by Frederick Wellington Ruckstuhl            FRANKLIN, by Frederick Wellington Ruckstuhl            MACAULAY, by Frederick Wellington Ruckstuhl            HAWTHORNE, by Jonathan Scott Hartley            SCOTT, by Herbert Adams             South end of portico            DANTE, by Herbert Adams                                 Ainsworth Rand Spofford,          Librarian of Congress., 1864-1897, chose his favorite authors to be portrayed          by busts on the Jefferson Building's portico, facing the Capitol.  Pictured          here is Dante, by sculptor Herbert Adams.                       The Construction Dates          Dates marking the beginning and end of the construction of the Jefferson          Building are carved in the granite exterior at the ground level on the          north end of the portico (1889) and the south end (1897). The cornerstone,          containing documents about the history of the building, was laid without          ceremony on August 28, 1890, on the ground level in the northeast corner.          The inscription, ""AUGUST 28, 1890,"" was put on the stone on January 16,          1952.                                  The          Jefferson Building opened in 1897 , eleven years after its construction          was authorized, and 26 years after Librarian Spofford called for a separate          Library building.                      The Entrance Porch          The Main Entrance to the Jefferson Building is at the top of the imposing          front stairway and through an entrance porch of three arches into the          Great Hall at the first floor level. The six life-size spandrel figures          leaning gracefully against the curve of each of the arches were sculpted          by Bela Lyon Pratt. They represent Literature (the left-hand arch), Science          (the center arch) and Art (the right-hand arch). Of the two figures representing          Literature, the left one holds a writing tablet and the right one holds          a book while gazing into the distance. Of the two figures representing          Science, the first holds the torch of Knowledge, and the second looks          upward, thus repeating, in a general way, the distinction between the          practical and the abstract seen in the left-hand door. In the third group,          the figure to the left represents Sculpture (he's working on a bust of          Dante), and the one to the right represents Painting.                      The Bronze Doors          The three arches of the Entrance Porch end at three massive bronze doors          covered with a design of rich sculptural ornament. Each is a double door,          14 feet high to the top of the arch, and weighs about three and one-half          tons. The subjects and the sculptors are, from left to right:  Tradition,           modeled by Olin Levi Warner;  The Art of Printing,  by Frederick          MacMonnies; and  Writing,  by Olin Levi Warner, which though unfinished          at his death in August 1896, was completed by Herbert Adams. Taken together          as a sequential series, Tradition, Writing, and Printing, illustrate the          successive and, according to Small's  Handbook,  the ""gradually          more perfect"" ways that humans have preserved religion, history, literature,          and science.                                           Tradition  (left-hand door)           Tradition  illustrates how knowledge was originally handed down          from generation to generation. In the lunette above the door, an American          Indian, a Norseman, a prehistoric man, and a shepherd listen intently          to the words of the central figure. Each of these lunette figures represents          peoples who kept their history alive via oral tradition. The face of the          Indian was taken from a sketch of Chief Joseph of the Nez Percé          tribe that sculptor Warner made in 1889. (The compiler of a contemporary          guidebook, Charles B. Reynolds, asserts that on the day in April 1897          when he was making notes on the door, ""Chief Joseph himself was here at          the Library, looking upon this portrait of himself."") The names of the          artist and the door's foundry can be seen at the bottom of the lunette.            The figures on the large door panels below the lunette represent Imagination            and Memory. Sculptor Warner's signature and the date of the work can            be seen near left foot of Imagination and the right foot of Memory.            The word ""Tradition,"" engraved on a medallion on the reverse side of            the lunette, can be seen from inside the entrance.                                           The Art of Printing  (center door)          Frederick MacMonnies entitled the lunette above the door ""Minerva Diffusing          the Products of Typographical Art."" Minerva, the Roman goddess of learning          and wisdom, is seated in the center. The Latin title of the subject,  Ars          Typographica,  and various symbolic ornaments can be seen in the background.          The figures on the door panels represent the Humanities and Intellect.          The artist has signed his work on the doors near the feet of Intellect.          The phrase ""Homage to Gutenberg,"" engraved on the reverse side of the          lunette, can be seen from inside the entrance.                                           Writing  (right-hand door)          In the lunette above the doors, the four figures surrounding the central          figure represent people who have influenced the world through their written          literature: an Egyptian and a Jew and a Christian and a Greek. The figures          on the door panels below represent Truth and Research. As the inscription          on the right side of the doors indicates, this work was begun by Olin          Levi Warner, who died in 1896, and completed by Herbert Adams.                                THE GREAT HALL - FIRST FLOOR                     The Entrance Vestibule          Even though many visitors first view the Great Hall after climbing the          stairs from the Library's ground floor entrance, the Great Hall was designed          so that the most spectacular view awaits those who enter through the bronze          doors at the first floor west entrance. From here one steps into the sumptuously          decorated main vestibule, with its gleaming white marble arches, stucco          decoration, and heavily-paneled and gold-ornamented ceiling. As your eye          travels up the short piers to the gilt ceiling you see the paired figures          of Minerva, created by Herbert Adams as the ""Minerva of War"" and the ""Minerva          of Peace"" and placed atop each marble pillar at the base of the double          staircases. ""Minerva of War"" grasps a short sword in one hand and holds          aloft the torch of learning in the other; ""Minerva of Peace"" holds a globe,          which symbolizes the universal scope of knowledge, and a scroll.            A plaque on the central pillar commemorates Daniel Wolsey Voorhees            (1827-1897), a Senator from Indiana. Voorhees strongly supported Librarian            Spofford's campaign to construct a separate Library building. The inscription            reads:           AS A MEMBER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE            LIBRARY, AS CHAIRMAN FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF THE JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE            ON ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THE LIBRARY, AND IN MANY ELOQUENT PLEAS            ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE TOOK A LEADING PART IN OBTAINING THIS LIBRARY            BUILDING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE                                           The Floors          The flooring in the entrance vestibule is made of white Italian marble,          with bands and geometric patterns of brown Tennessee marble. Modeling          and incised brass inlays have been added to the marble floor within the          Great Hall. In the center of the floor is the sun, on which are noted          the four cardinal points of the compass. These compass points correspond          to directions within the Library--e.g., the Main Reading Room is to the          east. Should you become confused about the location of any of the Jefferson          Building's features mentioned in this guidebook, please refer to this          compass to get your bearings.            The inlays represent the twelve signs of the zodiac, beginning with            Leo in the northwest corner. Proceeding clockwise, the others are: Cancer,            Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagitarrius, Scorpio,            Libra, and Virgo.                                           The Commemorative Arch          The arcade at the center of the east side of the Great Hall takes the          form of a triumphant arch commemorating the construction of the building.          The words LIBRARY OF CONGRESS are inscribed in tall gilt letters above          the arch. A marble tablet inscribed with the names of the building's construction          engineers and architects is part of the parapet immediately above. The          tablet, flanked by two majestic eagles, reads:           ERECTED UNDER THE ACTS OF CONGRESS OF APRIL 15 1886, OCTOBER            2 1888 AND MARCH 2 1889 BY BRIG. GEN. THOS. LINCOLN CASEY CHIEF OF ENGINEERS            U.S.A. BERNARD R. GREEN SUPT. AND ENGINEER JOHN L. SMITHMEYER ARCHITECT            PAUL J. PELZ ARCHITECT EDWARD PEARCE CASEY ARCHITECT            The spandrels of the arch beneath the inscriptions contain two signed            sculptured figures by Olin Levi Warner titled  The Students.             The figure on the left is a youth seeking to acquire knowledge from            books. On the right, an old sage is engaged in thought and reflection.                                  The          Minerva mosaic, the Gutenberg Bible exhibit, and the arch commemorating          the construction of the Jefferson Building  are captured in this photograph          of the east side of the Great Hall taken in the 1950s.           .                     The Staircases          The two great staircases flanking the Great Hall are embellished by elaborate          and varied sculptural work by Philip Martiny. At the base of each is a          bronze female figure wearing classic drapery and holding a torch of knowledge.          They are signed ""P H Martiny, sculptor NY""; the foundry's name is also          inscribed at the base. Each stair railing is decorated with a fanciful          series of cherubs carved by Martiny in white marble. In a niche on the          north side is a plaster bust of Thomas Jefferson and on the south is a          bronze bust of George Washington; both are copied from works by the sculptor          Jean-Antoine Houdon. The balustrade on each side of the top landing contains          Martiny's figures of cherubs modeled to represent the fine arts. At the          north landing, they are  Painting,   Architecture,  and           Sculpture ; at the south landing,  Comedy,   Poetry,           and  Tragedy.                                   The          elaborate ornamentation of the Great Hall , which has been called ""the          richest interior in America,"" is highlighted in this photograph taken          in the 1960s.                     The cherubs in the ascending railing of each staircase--according to Small's           Handbook --represent ""the various occupations, habits, and pursuits          of modern life."" The series begins at the bottom with the figure of a          stork. Then, on the north side of the hall, are figures of a  Gardener,           with a spade and a rake; an  Entomologist,  capturing butterflies;          a  Student  poring over a text; a  Printer,  with typefaces,          a type case, and a press. Halfway up the railing, on the same level, are          cherubs representing  Asia  and  Europe.  Next comes a  Musician ;          a  Physician,  mortar and pestle in hand; and an  Electrician           holding a telephone receiver at his ear and, Small writes, ""with a star          of electric rays shining on his brow."" At the top of the railing is an           Astronomer  with a telescope.            In the staircase railing on the south side of the Great Hall, beginning            at the bottom, the figures are a  Mechanic  with a cogwheel and            pincers; a  Hunter,  with a gun, hoisting a rabbit he has just            shot; a  Vintner  dressed like Bacchus, the Roman god of wine,            holding a goblet; a  Farmer  with a sickle and a sheaf of wheat.            Halfway up the railing are cherubs representing  Africa  and             America.  Next comes a  Fisherman ; a  Soldier,             a  Chemist,  with a blowpipe; and, last but not least, a  Cook.                                            The Ceiling          The names of ten great authors can be seen on tablets above the Great          Hall's semicircular latticed windows in the vaulted cove of the ceiling.          Beginning on the east and proceeding clockwise, the names are DANTE, HOMER,          MILTON, BACON, ARISTOTLE, GOETHE, SHAKESPEARE, MOLIERE, MOSES, and HERODOTUS.          The names of eight more authors are inscribed in gilt letters on tablets          beneath the second-story cartouches on the east and west sides of the          hall. Beginning on the east and reading left to right, the authors are          CERVANTES, HUGO, SCOTT, COOPER, LONGFELLOW, TENNYSON, GIBBON, and BANCROFT.                      The East Mosaic Corridor and            Entrance to the Main Reading Room                     Adorning the East Corridor are six lunettes by John White Alexander            that depict  The Evolution of the Book.  The subjects are, at            the south end, the  Cairn,   Oral Tradition,  and  Egyptian            Hieroglyphics ; and, at the north end,  Picture Writing,             the  Manuscript Book,  and the  Printing Press.             In the vault mosaics, at the ends and along the sides, are ten trophies,            each with symbols representing one of the arts or sciences. Below each            are the surnames of two native-born Americans associated with that art            or science. Beginning on the east wall and reading left to right, they            are: MATHEMATICS (Peirce and Bowditch), ASTRONOMY (Bond and Rittenhouse),            ENGINEERING (Francis and Stevens), NATURAL PHILOSOPHY (Silliman and            Cooke), ARCHITECTURE (Latrobe and Walter), MUSIC (Mason and Gottschalk),            PAINTING (Stuart and Allston), SCULPTURE (Powers and Crawford), POETRY            (Emerson and Holmes), and NATURAL SCIENCE (Say and Dana).            Names of native-born Americans distinguished in Medicine, Law, and            Theology are inscribed in the ceiling vault. Beginning at the north            end, they are: THEOLOGY (Brooks, Edwards, Mather, Channing, Beecher);            LAW (Shaw, Taney, Marshall, Story, Gibson, Pinckney, Kent, Hamilton,            Webster, Curtis); and MEDICINE (Cross, Wood, McDowell, Rush, Warren).                                  ""Law""          is one of 13 fields of knowledge celebrated in the East Mosaic Corridor           near the first floor entrance to the Main Reading Room.                     At either end of the East Corridor a stairway leads to the ground floor.          In the domed lobbies at the head of each stairway are these quotations:           North lobby            KNOWLEDGE IS POWER            Sir Francis Bacon,  De Hoeresibus              South lobby            E PLURIBUS UNUM [One From Many]            Horace,  Epistle  ii, 212.            Five small but stunning paintings by Elihu Vedder grace the lunettes            at the entrance to the Main Reading Room. (Each is copyrighted by the            artist along the lower edge.) This strategically-placed series and its            subject  Government  are of special importance. As Herbert Small            notes in his  Handbook,  ""In every sort of library the fundamental            thing is the advancement of learning--illustrated in the Reading Room            dome, as the visitor will see later--but in a library supported by the            nation the idea of government certainly comes next in importance.""            In the painting above the central door to the Reading Room, titled             Government  and representing the ideal state, one can see the            figure of Good Government holding a plaque on which is inscribed a quote            from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, ""A government of the people,            by the people, and for the people."" Two paintings explaining the practical            working of government flank each side of this central image. To the            left,  Corrupt Legislation  leads to  Anarchy  (the scroll            of learning is burning in Anarchy's right hand, and she is trampling            on a scroll, a lyre, a Bible, and a book); to the right,  Good Administration             (the youth on the right, educated by the books he is carrying, is casting            his ballot into the urn) leads to  Peace and Prosperity.                                  ""Government""          by Elihu Vedder,  in the central lunette over the door leading to the          Main Reading Room, represents the abstract conception of a republic as          the ideal state.                     THE MAIN READING ROOM                      Visitors should take the elevators to the third floor to view the            Main Reading Room from the Visitors' Gallery, or walk up the two flights            of marble stairs.                                           The Eight Symbolic Statues and Their Inscriptions          From the Visitors' Gallery, eight large statues can be seen above the          giant marble columns that surround the reading room. They represent eight          categories of knowledge, each considered symbolic of civilized life and          thought. Their titles are inscribed in gilt letters on a tablet in the          frieze below them. Beginning with the figures on the east side of the          room--from the perspective of the Visitor's Gallery--the symbolic statues          are:  Philosophy,  by Bela Lyon Pratt;  Art,  by Francois          M.L. Tonetti-Dozzi (after sketches by Augustus St. Gaudens);  History,           by Daniel Chester French;  Commerce,  by John Flanagan;  Religion,           by Theodore Baur;  Science,  by John Donoghue;  Law,  by          Paul Wayland Bartlett; and  Poetry,  by John Quincy Adams Ward.            Above each statue is a large tablet bearing an inscription in gilt            letters. Each of the eight inscriptions, appropriate to the subject            of the statue below it, was chosen by Harvard University President Charles            W. Eliot.           Above the figure of  Philosophy            THE INQUIRY, KNOWLEDGE, AND BELIEF OF TRUTH            IS THE SOVEREIGN GOOD OF HUMAN NATURE.

Milton,  Paradise Lost,  vii, 364                                           The Sixteen Bronze Statues          Sixteen bronze statues set along the balustrade of the galleries represent          men renowned for their accomplishments in the categories of knowledge          and activity described above. The subjects were chosen by Ainsworth Rand          Spofford, Librarian of Congress 1864-1897. The statues are paired, each          pair flanking one of the eight giant marble columns. The names of individual          figures are inscribed on the wall directly behind the statue. The list          of those selected as representatives of human thought and civilization          follows, along with the name of the sculptor of each statue.

The scroll in          his hand bears the Greek words OI NOMOI (""the law""). The sculptor is Frederick          Wellington Ruckstall.                     The State Seals          The seals of the states of the union at the time the Jefferson Building          was constructed are contained in the massive semicircular stained glass          windows that surround the Main Reading Room. At the top, in the middle          of each of the eight windows, is the Great Seal of the United States.          To the right and left, following the curve of each window, are the seals          of the states and territories, three on a side, six in each window. Thus,          forty-eight seals are included.            The name of the state or territory is inscribed above each seal, along            with the date of the year in which it was admitted to the Union or organized            under a territorial form of government. The seals are displayed in the            order of their dates. The series begins in the west window (above and            behind the Visitors' Gallery).            Above the bronze statues of Moses and Newton are the seals: Delaware,            1787; Pennsylvania, 1787; New Jersey, 1787; Georgia, 1788; Connecticut,            1788; Massachusetts, 1788.            Proceeding clockwise, in the northwest window, above the bronze statues            of Henry and Solon, are: Maryland, 1788; South Carolina, 1788; New Hampshire,            1788; Virginia, 1788; New York, 1788; North Carolina, 1789.            In the north window, above the bronze statues of Kent and Shakespeare,            are: Rhode Island, 1790; Vermont, 1791; Kentucky, 1792; Tennessee, 1796;            Ohio, 1802; Louisiana, 1812.            In the northeast window, above the bronze statues of Homer and Plato,            are: Indiana, 1816; Mississippi, 1817; Illinois, 1818; Alabama, 1819;            Maine, 1820; Missouri 1821.

In the southwest window, above the bronze statues of Fulton and St.            Paul, are: Idaho, 1890; Wyoming, 1890; Utah, 1895; New Mexico, 1850            (territory); Arizona, 1863 (territory); Oklahoma, 1890 (territory).                                           The Paintings in the Dome          Edwin Howland Blashfield's murals, which adorn the dome of the Main Reading          Room, occupy the central and the highest point of the building and form          the culmination of the entire interior decorative scheme. The round mural          set inside the lantern of the dome depicts  Human Understanding,           looking upward beyond the finite intellectual achievements represented          by the twelve figures in the collar of the dome.            These twelve seated figures represent the twelve countries, or epochs,            which Blashfield felt contributed most to American civilization. To            the immediate right of each figure is a tablet on which is inscribed            the name of the country typified and, below this, the name of the outstanding            contribution of that country to human progress.            The figures follow each other in chronological order, beginning in            the east, the cradle of civilization. The figures and their respective            inscriptions are:           EGYPT: WRITTEN RECORDS          The personal seal of Mena, the first Egyptian King, is inscribed in hieroglypics          in the tablet.           JUDEA: RELIGION          On the face of the pillar is inscribed, in Hebrew characters, the injunction:          Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. (Holy Bible, Leviticus 19:18)             GREECE: PHILOSOPHY              ROME: ADMINISTRATION              ISLAM: PHYSICS              THE MIDDLE AGES: MODERN LANGUAGES              ITALY: THE FINE ARTS              GERMANY: THE ART OF PAINTING              SPAIN: DISCOVERY            ENGLAND: LITERATURE          The figure is holding a facsimile of the first edition of Shakespeare's           A Midsummer's Night Dream,  printed in 1600.           FRANCE: EMANCIPATION          The figure is holding ""Les Droits de l'Homme,"" The Declaration of the          Rights of Man adopted by the French Assembly in 1789.           AMERICA: SCIENCE          The figure, an engineer whose face was modeled from Abraham Lincoln's,          sits in his machine shop pondering a problem of mechanics. In front of          him is an electric dynamo, representing the American contribution to the          advancement of electricity. Blashfield has signed his work on the base          of the dynamo, with the accompanying inscription: ""These decorations were          designed and executed by EDWIN HOWLAND BLASHFIELD, assisted by ARTHUR          REGINALD WILLETT, A.D. MDCCCLXXXXVI.""                                 This photograph of  Edwin          H. Blashfeld's mural above the Main Reading Room  depicts four of the          twelve countries, or epochs, that contributed to the ""Evolution of Civilization,""          from Egypt to America.                     THE NORTH CORRIDOR - FIRST FLOOR                       Family  and  Education  are major themes in this corridor,            which is located behind the north staircase in the Great Hall.            Above the window at the west end of the corridor (through which you            can see the Capitol) is a lunette with two female figures holding aloft            a scroll with the quotation:            GIVE INSTRUCTION UNTO THOSE WHO CANNOT PROCURE IT FOR THEMSELVES.           Confucius, Book XIII, Sec. 9                                 Charles Sprague Pearce          painted the  two figures and scroll above the window          at the west end of the North Mosaic Corridor.                    Dominating the corridor are seven paintings by Charles Sprague Pearce.           The Family   is the subject of the large tympanum at the east          end, above the entrance to the Librarian's office. The smaller panels          near the ceiling along the north wall represent activities associated          with family life. From left to right, they depict  Religion,   Labor,            Study,  and  Recreation.  The single painting on the south          side, opposite the panel of  Recreation,  represents  Rest.                                   ""The          Family,"" a painting by Charles Sprague Pearce,  can be seen at the          east end of the North Mosiac Corridor. Six other paintings by Pearce are          part of the beautiful and elaborately decorated chamber.                     The penetrations in the vault above the paintings contain the surnames          of distinguished men of education throughout the world. On the north side,          left to right, they are: FROEBEL, PESTALOZZI, ROUSSEAU, COMENIUS, and          ASCHAM. On the south side, above the columns and arches lending to the          Great Hall, they are: HOWE, GALLAUDET, MANN, ARNOLD, and SPENCER.            In the mosaic vaulting of the ceiling, from west to east, are the            words ART (above the quotation by Confucius), FAMILY, ASTRONOMY (surrounded,            clockwise from the north, by MATHEMATICS, CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, and GEOLOGY),            POETRY (surrounded, clockwise from the north, by SCULPTURE, PAINTING,            MUSIC, and ARCHITECTURE), EDUCATION, and SCIENCE (above the painting            of  The Family ).            The names of the thirteen men appointed by the President of the United            States to the post of Librarian of Congress are inscribed on the east            wall beneath the painting of  The Family.  The dates are the            terms of office served. The Librarians listed above the line served            in the Library of Congress in the Capitol, before the Jefferson Building            was constructed:            JOHN BECKLEY 1802-1807                        PATRICK MAGRUDER 1807-1815                        GEORGE WATTERSTON 1815-1829                        JOHN SILVA MEEHAN 1829-1861                        JOHN S.

The nine lunettes            (one at each end of the corridor and seven along the west wall) depict            the  Muses  and were rendered by Edward Simmons, who copyrighted            each of his paintings in the lower edge.            According to Greek mythology, the Muses were the goddesses of various            departments of Art, Poetry, and Science. Apollo, the god of song, was            their father, and Mnemosyne (Memory) their mother. Their names, which            appear at the center and top of each lunette by Simmons, are listed            below, beginning at the south end of the corridor: Melpomene (Tragedy),            Clio (History), Thalia (Comedy and Bucolic Poetry), Euterpe (Lyric Song),            Terpsichore (Dancing), Erato (Love Poetry), Polyhymia (Sacred Song),            Urania (Astronomy), and Calliope (Epic Poetry).            Three of the paintings have quotations beneath them.             Beneath Thalia            DESCEND, YE NINE! DESCEND AND SING            WAKE INTO VOICE EACH SILENT STRING            Pope,  Ode on St. Cecilia's Day              Beneath Terpsichore            O HEAV'N-BORN SISTERS! SOURCE OF ART!            WHO CHARM THE SENSE, OR MEND THE HEART.            Pope,  Two Choruses to the Tragedy of Brutus              Beneath Urania            SAY, WILL YE BLESS THE BLEAK ATLANTIC SHORE,            AND IN THE WEST BID ATHENS RISE ONCE MORE?            Pope,  Two Choruses to the Tragedy of Brutus             The Northwest Pavilion at the end of the corridor is decorated with            medallions containing figures of dancing girls by Robert Leftwich Dodge.            A series of the signs of the zodiac, designed by W. Mills Thompson,            is in the six arched windows.                                THE LIBRARIAN'S ROOM            (VISITED ONLY BY PERMISSION)                      Now used primarily for ceremonial purposes, this room was the office            of the Librarian of Congress from 1897 until 1980, when the office was            moved to the Madison Building. The central disc of the domed ceiling            contains a painting by Edward J. Holslag, representing Letters. The            following sentence is inscribed on a streamer:           LITERA SCRIPTA MANET [The written word endures]            There are four additional circular paintings in the pendentives (corners)            of the dome, signed, like the dome painting, ""E. J. Holslag."" The inscriptions,            starting over the door and moving left to right, read as follows:           IN TENEBRIS LUX [In darkness light]            LIBER DILECTATION ANIMAE [Books, the delight of the soul]            EFFICIUNT CLARUM STUDIO [They make it clear by study]            DULCE ANTE OMNIA MUSAE [The Muses, above all things, delightful]                                THE SOUTH MOSAIC CORRIDOR -            FIRST FLOOR                       Lyric Poetry  is the decoration theme in the corridor behind            the south staircase in the Great Hall.            Above the window at the west end (through which you can see the Capitol            and, beyond that, the Mall), a broad border contains an idyllic summer            landscape. At the top is a banner with a quotation from Wordsworth:            THE POETS, WHO ON EARTH HAVE MADE US HEIRS            OF TRUTH AND PURE DELIGHT BY HEAVENLY LAYS.            Henry Oliver Walker's mural  Lyric Poetry --found at the east            end of the corridor--provides the general theme. Lyric Poetry stands            with a lyre in the center; the words ""Lyric Poetry"" can be seen in the            lunette border directly above her. Other figures, seen from left to            right, are Mirth (boy), Beauty (seated woman), Passion (woman with right            arm held high), Pathos (woman standing upward), Truth (standing nude),            and Devotion (seated woman).                                 Henry          Oliver Walker's mural ""Lyric Poetry,""  is at the east end of the South          Mosaic Corridor, a hallway that celebrates both European and American          poets. The Americans are Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,          James Russell Lowell, John Greenleaf Whittier, William Cullen Bryant,          Walt Whitman, and Edgar Allan Poe.                    The names of fifteen Library of Congress employees who died in World War          II are inscribed on a marble panel beneath the mural.            Henry Oliver Walker also painted the smaller lunettes along the south            and north walls. In each, Walker depicts a youth suggested by works            of different English and American poets.            The poets represented on the panels on the south wall and the poem            represented by the figure in the lunette are, from east to west:           Tennyson            The panel refers to these lines from the poem, ""Palace of Art"":            FLUSHED GANYMEDE, HIS ROSY THIGH            HALF-BURIED IN THE EAGLE'S DOWN,            SOLE AS A FLYING STAR SHOT THRO' THE SKY            ABOVE THE PILLAR'D TOWN                       Alfred          Tennyson's poem ""Ganymede"" is one of six poems depicted in paintings by          Henry Oliver Walker in the South Mosaic Corridor.  The most famous          poet of the Victorian age, Tennyson is well-represented throughout the          Jefferson Building; his name is in the ceiling of the Great Hall, and          his poetry is also found in the Southwest Corridor on the first floor          (The Greek Heroes) and the Great Hall's second floor North Corridor.                      Keats            The panel represents Endymion, in Keats' poem of that name.             Wordsworth            The panel is based on Wordsworth's lines beginning:            THERE WAS A BOY; YE KNEW HIM WLLL, YE CLIFFS            AND ISLANDS OF WINANDER!             Emerson            The panel is based on Emerson's lines from ""Uriel:""            LINE IN A NATURE IS NOT FOUND            UNIT AND UNIVERSE ARE ROUND;            IN VAIN PRODUCED, ALL RAYS RETURN            EVIL WILL BLESS, AND ICE WILL BURN            The poets represented on the panels along the north wall and the lines            referred to are, from east to west:           Milton            The panel is based on Milton's poem ""Comus"":            CAN ANY MORTAL MIXTURE OF EARTH'S MOULD            BREATH SUCH DIVINE ENCHANTING RAVISHMENT?             Shakespeare            The panel refers to the poem  Venus and Adonis,  showing            the body of Adonis, killed by the boar.            The names of lyric poets are contained in the mosaic of the ceiling            vault. Six Americans are honored on the north side: LONGFELLOW, LOWELL,            WHITTIER, BRYANT, WHITMAN, and POE. Poets honored on the south side            are the Europeans HEINE, HUGO, MUSSET, BYRON, SHELLEY, and BROWNING.            The names of ancient poets are inscribed in the center of the vault:            THEOCRITUS, PINDAR, ANACREON, SAPPHO, CATULLUS, HORACE, PETRARCH, and            RONSARD.                                THE SOUTHWEST CORRIDOR - FIRST            FLOOR                      The Southwest Corridor--leading from the South Mosaic Corridor ( Lyric            Poetry ) to the Southwest Pavilion--looks out, to the left, on an            interior court. The nine lunettes (one at each end of the corridor and            seven along the west wall) contain paintings by Walter McEwen which            represent  The Greek Heroes  (note the artist's copyright notice            on each lunette). Beginning over the doorway at the north end, continuing            along the west wall, and ending at the south end, the paintings depict            Paris, Jason, Bellerophon, Orpheus, Perseus, Prometheus, Theseus, Achilles,            and Hercules. The name of each Greek hero can be seen at the top center            of each border. Four of the paintings have quotations beneath them.           Beneath  Jason            ONE EQUAL TEMPER OF HEROIC HEARTS,            MADE WEAK BY TIME AND FATE, BUT STRONG IN WILL            TO STRIVE, TO SEEK, TO FIND, AND NOT TO YIELD            Tennyson,  Ulysses              Beneath  Orpheus            A GLORIOUS COMPANY, THE FLOWER OF MEN,            TO SERVE AS MODEL FOR THE MIGHTY WORLD,            AND BE THE FAIR BEGINNING OF A TIME            Tennyson,  Idylls of the King              Beneath  Prometheus            TO THE SOULS OF FIRE, I, PALLAS ATHENA, GIVE MORE FIRE,            AND TO THOSE WHO ARE MANFUL, A MIGHT MORE THAN A MAN'S.

Along the center of the ceiling are panels by Carl Gutherz that represent            civilization through the Spectrum of Light. Each of the seven panels,            unfortunately rather pale (though the artist's copyright notices are            still legible), features a central figure who symbolizes some phase            of achievement, human or divine. The cherubs in the corners of each            panel represent the arts or sciences, and the escutcheons in each panel            present the title of the decoration, the seals of the various states            of the nation, and the mottoes of those seals. (Several of the seals            do not have mottoes and the seals of California, Minnesota, and South            Dakota are omitted altogether.)            The order of the subjects begins with the central panel (Yellow: ""Let            There Be Light"") and moves north (Orange, Red, Violet) and then south            (Green, Blue, Indigo) from the center. The several hues of the spectrum            are separately diffused over each panel, decreasing in intensity as            they recede from the central figures.                                           Let There Be Light (Yellow)          The subject is the creation of light. The Divine Intelligence, sitting          enthroned in the midst of space, utters the words, ""Let there be light.""          (Holy Bible, Genesis: 1:3) The cherubs in the corners represent Physics,          Metaphysics, Psychology, and Theology.

A spirit on a pyramid of steps (signifying Progress)          holds a streamer bearing the mottoes: COURAGE, EFFORT, EXCELLENCE, EXCELSIOR.          The corner cherubs typify phases of human development regarding Architecture          and Art; Transportation; the Phonograph and Telephone; and Invention and          Design.

The color was chosen by the artist because violet          results from the union of the American colors red, white, and blue.

It dates from the Later Liang dynasty, just after the fall of the Tang. Wang was a high official who died in A.D. 923, having served both Tang and Liang Dynasty rulers. The design of Wang's tomb, though essentially in Tang style, anticipated future artistic developments.   This is one of two reliefs that framed the coffin chamber, part of a complex of rooms arranged on a north-south axis and accessed via a ramp at the south. The decoration in Wang's tomb followed the imperial Tang model, with lively painted wall murals lining passageways and tomb chambers. Tang painting was mostly figurative, and this emphasis is still evident in the marble panel. Several ink landscape paintings, which were also found in the tomb, however, were precursors of an entirely new genre.    Much of Wang's tomb art had been looted prior to excavation in 1995, but the two painted marble reliefs remained in excellent condition. The east wall relief shows a group of thirteen female attendants carrying luxury items to ensure the tomb owner's well-being. The relief on the west wall (shown here) is a lively depiction of a female orchestra, along with a conductor and two tiny dancers at the lower right. The combination of these and other paintings in the tomb indicate not only that Wang wished to surround himself with all the pleasures that he had enjoyed while living, but that he sincerely respected Tang art traditions.   The musicians have the ample proportions, full robes, and elaborate coiffures characteristic of the Tang conception of female beauty, which is said to have originated with the favorite courtesan of the emperor Xuanzong, Yang Guifei (see page 31).   The bodies of the musicians seem to sway with the tempo of the music. Easily identified are the pipe harmonica with a long mouthpiece (next to the conductor), a harp, a  zheng  (a plucked instrument), and a  pipa  (a Chinese lute). One musician also beats a large drum. The artists who sculpted these reliefs had a keen eye for accuracy.   Painted reliefs of this size and quality are rare from this period. Possibly artisans formerly employed in stone sculpture and relief carving at Buddhist sites, who had been displaced by the persecutions ending in A.D. 845, found new employment decorating tomb chambers such as Wang Chuzhi's.       previous    object 20 of 20       Table of Contents                                                   planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2003 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.
GX025-33-4254186	"Hispanic RR  >>  Hispanic  Division  >>  About  the Hispanic RR  >> Portinari Murals              Portinari Murals        Four Portinari Murals adorn the vestibule walls of the Hispanic Reading Room   From the time of the dedication of the Hispanic Room, it was hoped that the two vestibules could be decorated by some outstanding muralist from Latin America.  Since the Foundation already possessed a mural of the Columbus coat of arms symbolizing the Spanish contribution to American history, it was felt that it would be appropriate to entrust the decor of these vestibules to a Brazilian so that the Portuguese-speaking people of America also might be represented.   Cândido Portinari seemed just the person for the task.  Accordingly, in November 1940, Librarian of Congress  Archibald MacLeish  invited the painter to consider the preparation of sketches for the murals.  Portinari, who had just returned to Brazil from his exhibition in New York, knew the space that had been allotted for the project and was enthusiastic.  The Brazilian Government, welcoming the invitation, provided funds for his return to Washington in August 1941 to prepare sketches.   In a series of discussions with Mr. MacLeish, Portinari planned the themes of the four large paintings and shortly afterwards presented gouache sketches that were approved by the Librarian and the Architect of the Capitol, David Lynn.  To enable Portinari to execute the murals, a fund equal to that already appropriated by the Brazilian Government was obtained from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.   Cândido Portinari began to paint on the walls of the Hispanic Division late in October, assisted by his brother Luiz. Two months later the work was completed, and on January 12, 1942 it was inaugurated in a ceremony conducted by the Brazilian ambassador, Senhor Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, Nelson Rockefeller, Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, and  Lewis Hanke , the Hispanic Foundation director.   In designing the murals, Portinari himself imposed the restriction that the figures and the objects be so represented as to apply not to one age alone but to the whole succession of periods since the coming of the Spaniards and Portuguese to America.  On the first wall he decided to depict the primary event -- the discovery of the land -- but without specifically representing either the Portuguese under Cabral who came to Brazil or the Spaniards under Columbus.  Next he showed the great American theme of pioneering, of the conquest of forests and the domination of the land, the act of penetration which had gradually taken place all over Hispanic America, from Patagonia to the Rio Grande.  For the symbol of this theme he chose the actual entry of pioneers into the primeval forest.  In the third mural he represented cultural beginnings through the basic teaching of the Indians by members of the religious orders.  Here again his theme was international.  It might have been recorded in Mexico, Paraguay, or Brazil.  For his final mural he reserved the theme of work.  Specifically he chose mining -- the most spectacular aspect of the economy of Mexico, Brazil, and other sections of South and Central America in the colonial period.  In the figures of his murals, Portinari represented the three races of the Americas: the Indian, the black, and the white.   In the matter of technique he faced a choice of one of several processes.  The murals could be painted on canvas set in the walls or directly on the walls, either on wet plaster in the true fresco technique or on dry plaster in tempera.  Portinari was thoroughly familiar with all three processes, but elected to use the third because it promised the most successful blending of monumentality with luminous coloring, because it seemed the most effective for the relatively small space available, and because it would permit him a greater freedom of experimentation while working with a subject and in an atmosphere hitherto unfamiliar to him.    Characteristically,    Portinari's first painting,  Discovery of the Land ,    is dominated not by captains or the admirals or the priests of the conquest    but by the common sailors who manned the fleet. This mural has the most baroque    composition of the series. It is divided vertically by the twisting ropes of    the ship's rigging and ladders. The sweeping diagonals of the gunwales and the    swirling masses of water join with the powerful exultant figures of the men    to heighten the movement and excitement of the scene. The wind of conquest and    of expectation seems to blow through the picture and the effect is heightened    by the Tiepolo-like blues and greys and whites, the true tonalities of the sea,    that predominate.         The second painting,  Entry into the Forest ,    is reminiscent of frescoes in the Brazilian Ministry of Education. The idea    of representing tropical animals, birds, and insects in a jungle setting derives    from the decorations of the dining room Portinari prepared for the Rio de Janeiro    residence of Senhor José Nabuco. In both the ink and the gouache sketches    for the mural of the Hispanic Room, the composition is square, and the scene    is dominated by two large figures at the right. On the wall, however, the picture    assumed larger proportions. This mural contrasts with the first in that the    composition is more static and the figures more solidly realized. Yet there    is the same insistence upon essential things in the meticulous rendering of    the hands and arms of the explorers and the almost unfinished aspect of the    figure of the drinking man beside the stream.       The two murals in the larger room present a similar stylistic contrast. The     Teaching of the Indians , built around a classic    triangular arrangement of figures, follows the sober, contained tradition of    Portinari's early work. As with the  Discovery  mural, the artist originally    planned a different composition. An ink sketch on file at the Library of Congress    shows a seated priest before a mass of striding Indians who bear a curious resemblance    to those of the first of the Mexican José Clemente Orozco's frescoes    in the Dartmouth College Library. This the painter found ""too regimented.""    In the finished mural the theme is international, but the symbols are peculiarly Brazilian.  The scene is a 16th-century coastal settlement, a village where such Jesuit fathers as Anchieta and Nóbrega labored in peaceful penetration to instruct the Tupi Indians and save their souls.  The painter has carefully grouped his figures to show the trust and affection of these Indians for their devoted preceptos.  The intimate spirit of the work is fostered by the warm encircling background tones of the rich red earth, colors that go back to the  terra roxa  of São Paulo, by the presence of the spotted cow mentioned in one of Anchieta's letters, and by scattered folk objects -- a coiled rope, a shining metal trunk, and a hoary calabash, elements familiar as signatures in Portinari's paintings.    The    last mural represents the  Mining of Gold . In    it Portinari broke both with the Ministry frescoes and the World's Fair decorations.    He abandoned the first idea of many boats floating on a winding river to concentrate    on a single boat with a single group of figures. As in the first Hispanic Room    mural, he moved from a distant general view to a specific close-up incident.    In both paintings there is violent excitement; both represent the tenseness    of the moment of discovery; both are exultant. But here the painter introduces    a more frenzied pattern through the symbol of the worker's hand, raised, gesticulating,    grasping, pressing. Impressionistic in color in the sudden brilliant strokes    of unrelated colors on the skiff, in the hair of the miners, in the glint of    gold and the tiny gleaming fish, this painting marks the farthest evolution    of the painter's mural style toward the dissolution of form and color and derives    from a series of experimental oils centering around the theme of a shipwreck,    which Portinari made in the summer of 1941.

Along the center of the ceiling is a series of three paintings on the           Life of Man  by William A. Mackay, representing infant to mature          adult and finally aged man with a cane. At the north and south ends of          the ceiling is a tablet bearing the names of Americans who made significant          contributions to the machinery and production of printing.         At the rear of the East Corridor is a staircase that leads to a Visitors'          Gallery from which you can view the Main Reading Room  (pictured in          the image on the right) . On the first landing as you go up the staircase,          observe in front of you Elihu Vedder's large marble mosaic portrait of          the  Minerva of Peace , part of her armor laid aside, standing          guard before the Main Reading Room. On her right is a statue of Victory;          at her left, her symbol, the owl. She is holding in her hand a scroll          that lists various departments of learning, science and art.                                                       Maps and Floor Plans for the Library of Congress               A  labelled                map of the Second Floor of the Jefferson Building  is available.                                                        From          the Visitors' Gallery you will be able to see the domed ceiling, stretching          160 feet above the floor of the Main Reading Room  (picture on the left) .          The female figure painted in the cupola by Edwin Blashfield represents           Human Understanding , which is visible only to those in the Reading          Room below (not visible in the image on the left). The dozen 10-foot-high          figures in the circular mural at the apex of the dome, also painted by          Blashfield, represent the countries or epochs that contributed to the          development of Western civilization. Stained glass representations of          the seals of 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) adorn the eight semicircular          windows surrounding the Reading Room. Eight giant marble columns each          support 10-foot-high allegorical female figures in plaster representing          characteristic features of civilized life and thought:  Religion ,           Commerce ,  History ,  Art ,  Philosophy ,           Poetry ,  Law  and  Science .                  The 16 bronze statues set upon the balustrades of the galleries pay homage          to men whose lives symbolized the thought and activity represented by          the plaster statues below. Included are Moses and St. Paul ( Religion );          Christopher Columbus and Robert Fulton ( Commerce ); Herodotus          and Edward Gibson ( History ); Michelangelo and Ludwig van Beethoven          ( Art ); Plato and Francis Bacon ( Philosophy ); Homer and          William Shakespeare ( Poetry ); Solon and James Kent ( Law );          and Isaac Newton and Joseph Henry ( Science ). The circle of knowledge          is completed by the reader desks, as users of the Main Reading Room make          their own contributions to the various fields of knowledge represented          by the paintings and statuary in the room. Visit the  Main          Reading Room  as well as all of the other online reading room and information          center home pages via the  Services for          Researchers page .                 North Corridor         In          the North Corridor of the Great Hall, you will see ceiling paintings by          Robert Reid representing  The Five Senses . Beginning at the west          end or the front of the building, they are  Taste ,  Sight ,           Smell ,  Hearing  and  Touch . In the four circular          paintings along the wall, Reid has portrayed  Wisdom   (shown          on the left) ,  Understanding ,  Knowledge ,  Philosophy .          In the arch beneath the ceiling at the west end of the corridor are five          semicircular or circular tablets, two of which contain the obverse and          reverse of the Great Seal of the United States. The other three carry          inscriptions from Pope, Cicero and Emerson regarding order, memory and          beauty, respectively. In the same position at the opposite or eastern          end of the corridor is a painting of the Western Hemisphere.         Northwest Gallery and Pavilion         The          Northwest Gallery and Pavilion is used from time to time for changing          exhibitions. The murals at each end of the long gallery were painted by          Gari Melchers, echoing themes of paintings he had done for the World's          Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. They are  War  at the          far or north end of the room as you enter from the Great Hall; and  Peace            (shown on the right)  at the south end. The far end of the gallery          opens to the domed Pavilion of Art and Science containing murals by William          de Leftwich Dodge depicting  Literature ,  Music ,  Science           and  Art . In the apex of the dome is his painting of  Ambition ,          considered the incentive for all human effort. There are similar pavilion          spaces in all four corners of the first and second floors of the Jefferson          Building. The  African and Middle          Eastern Reading Room  is located off of the Pavilion of Art and Science.         Other Features         In          each of the four corners of the Great Hall, are a series of panels, painted          in rich Pompeian red with female figures representing  The Virtues ,          by George Willoughby Maynard. Eight in all,  Industry  and  Concord           are located at the northwest corner;  Fortitude  and  Justice            (shown on the right and left)  are found in the northeast corner;           Temperance  and  Prudence  are located at the southwest          corner; and  Patriotism  and  Courage  are found in the          southeast corner. Another interesting feature is the series of 56 printers'          marks that adorn the triangular penetrations of the ceiling vaults all          around the four corridors of the Second Floor of the Great Hall. These          marks are reproductions of the devices that early printers used on the          title pages of their books, partly as a kind of informal trademark to          protect their work and partly as a personal emblem representing a publisher          of good standing. Some more modern printers marks may be found along the          north corridor, along with that of one of the most famous printers of          all time, William Caxton.         West and South Corridors         The ceiling paintings in the vaults of the west corridor by Walter Shirlaw          depict  The Sciences . At either end of the ceiling is a tablet          bearing a list of names of men distinguished in the sciences that are          represented in the paintings. There are also three medallions in the center          of the corridor by William B. Van Ingen depicting  Sculpture ,           Architecture  and  Painting .         The        South Corridor parallels the north. Frank W. Benson's paintings at the center        of the vaulted ceiling depict  The Three Graces,  balancing Reid's        paintings from the North Corridor. Appearing in the arch at the western        end are painted semicircular and circular medallions, containing a caduceus,        associated with the Greek god Hermes, and a lictor's ax, carried by an official        before a Roman magistrate to show authority. At the opposite end, echoing        the Western Hemisphere painted in the North Corridor, is a painting of the        Eastern Hemisphere.         The four circular wall paintings in the South Corridor, also by Benson,          depict  The Four Seasons . The artist has painted a half-length          figure of a beautiful young woman to represent each season, using subtle          differences in colors, foliage and background to distinguish one season          from another (pictured on the right is  Summer ).         Southwest Gallery and Pavilion (Treasures Gallery)         Located in the Southwest Gallery and Pavilion to your right as you walk          through the South Corridor is the  Treasures          Gallery , which features a permanent exhibition of some of the Library's          most interesting and significant treasures of American history as well          as unique and fascinating examples of the nation's cultural heritage.                                               Special Presentation:                American Treasures of the Library of Congress ,                a permanent exhibition in the Treasures Gallery (Southwest Gallery                and Pavilion) can be viewed online.                                       The          large murals at each end of the Treasures Gallery were painted by Kenyon          Cox.  The Sciences  are the subject of the painting at the far          end of the gallery as you enter from the Great Hall;  The Arts           are shown in the mural at the north end, behind you. The far end of the          Treasures Gallery opens to domed  Pavilion of the Discoverers . The          paintings here are the work of George W. Maynard, and the subjects are:           Adventure ,  Discovery ,  Conquest  and  Civilization .          The spirit of  Adventure  leads to  Discovery , which in          turn leads to  Conquest  and then  Civilization . At the          center of the dome, Maynard has selected the four qualities he finds are          the most appropriate to these four stages of a nation's development:  Courage ,           Valor ,  Fortitude  and  Achievement .

GX006-57-6806889	"Printed Textile    Rendered by  Joseph Lubrano , c. 1941  watercolor on paperboard, 36.5 x 29 cm (14 3/8 x 11 7/16 in.)  Index of American Design  1943.8.950                From the Tour: Textiles from the Index of American Design   Object 12 of 17        In America, commercial production of printed textiles was a profitable business by  1800. While the growth of the textile industry in America was encouraged by the  availability of cheap cotton and by protective tariffs, mechanization was the key  to an expanding textile industry. Mechanical spinning was introduced in Rhode Island  in 1789, and the power loom came into use in 1814. With these machines American  mills accelerated and vastly increased the production of textiles. The tedious  wood-block technique gave way to the more expeditious process of roller printing,  that is, using metal cylinders with engraved surface designs as the means by which  patterns were transferred to fabric. By the middle of the nineteenth century,  textile mills were flourishing throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states.  Fall River, Massachusetts, became an important textile manufacturing and printing  center, and among the factories in that location, Andrew Robeson and Company  was pre-eminent. Here is a cotton print produced by the Robeson Company  between 1834 and 1848 and bearing the company's label. The fabric is woven in  stripes of white and soft yellow. The striped design is overlaid with a floral pattern  printed in black and red and reminiscent of the floral forms seen in Indian fabrics.  The delicacy of the printed pattern is in keeping with the refinement of the colors  and justifies the many awards the company received for the ""fineness"" of their products.                 back to gallery     continue tour                                                           planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2003 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C."

In turning away from the radiance of the previous decade, Rothko heightened the perceptual subtlety of his paintings, making distinctions between shape and ground more difficult to discern. He also transformed the impact his canvases have on the experience of space, which is now characterized by a sensation of enclosure. This quality, which lends itself to meditation, can be clearly related to the spiritual nature of a chapel.                                                                                                                                                  planning a visit   |      the collection   |       exhibitions   |       online tours  |      education  |      programs & events        resources   |        gallery shop  |      NGAkids  |        search   |      help   |       contact us   |       site map   |       what's new  |      home             Copyright ©2003 National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.

The Main Entrance to the building's first floor           consists of three double, bronze entrance doors, weighing a total of 3           tons, depict  Tradition ,  Writing  and  Printing             (shown in the image on the right) . They represent how history,           religion, literature and science have been preserved and disseminated           by man. The doors were modeled by Frederick MacMonnies, Olin L. Warner           and Herbert Adams and are now opened only for special occasions.          After entering the building from these doors, or coming up one flight           of stairs from the Ground Floor Visitors' Entrance, you will find yourself           in the West Corridor of the Library's ornate Great Hall, also known as           the Vestibule                                                            Maps and Floor Plans for the Library of Congress                A  labeled                 map of the First Floor of the Jefferson Building  is available.                                                            West Corridor, or Vestibule, of the Great Hall          The           West Corridor on the First Floor of the Library of Congress' Jefferson           Building serves as the Vestibule to the Great Hall  (pictured in the           image on the left) . The Great Hall is constructed of white Italian           marble and occupies a large portion of the front of the building.                The stucco ceiling of the Vestibule is accented with 23 karat gold leaf.           Around the border of the ceiling stand eight pairs of statues  (seen           directly above the columns in the image on the left)  representing           the Goddess Minerva. The work of Herbert Adams, each pair contains a Minerva           of War -- carrying the torch of learning in one hand and a falchion, or           short, stout sword, in the other -- and the Minerva of Peace -- carrying           a globe, signifying the universal scope of knowledge, and a scroll. Minerva           and the owl, her symbol, are repeated throughout the Great Hall.                   The Great Hall          Once         in the Great Hall, you will be able to appreciate the grandeur of the architecture.         The ceiling, 75 feet above the marble floor, is decorated with stained glass         skylights supported by elaborately paneled beams finished in aluminum leaf.         In the center of the marble floor is a large brass inlay shaped like a sun,         on which are inscribed the four cardinal points of the compass. Bordering         the sun on four sides are round medallions with 12 brass inlays representing         the signs of the zodiac. In niches on the west side of the hall are two         bronze masks formerly used as drinking fountains.          On the east side is the Commemorative Arch leading back to the Main Reading           Room  (pictured in the image on the right) . Inscribed into the frieze           above are the words  Library of Congress . Above that, flanked           by eagles, is a tablet with the names of the engineers and architects           who were responsible for the design and construction of the Jefferson           Building.          Two           grand staircases that display the work of sculptor Philip Martiny flank           the Great Hall  (one of these staircases is shown in the image to the           left) . Upon the newel post at the base of the railing of each staircase           stands an unnamed, larger-than-life-size bronze female figure holding           aloft a torch. Be sure to look closely at the marble figures carved into           the outside of the railings. These  putti , or small children,           complete with the tools of their trade, represent the various occupations,           habits and pursuits of ""modern life"": a musician with lyre and music book;           an electrician holding a telephone; and an entomologist, with specimen           box and butterfly net; among others. Note especially the two figures flanking           globes halfway up the staircase on each side. On the south side of the           hall are represented Africa and America, with those continents shown on           the globe between them; on the north side are Europe and Asia.          East Corridor          The           East Corridor features a vaulted ceiling is covered with mosaics honoring           Americans and their achievements in a variety of professions: painting,           poetry, engineering, natural philosophy, architecture, natural science,           music, sculpture and astronomy. Along the central portion of the ceiling           are three medallions depicting the professions of theology, law and medicine.          John White Alexander's six paintings in the semicircular areas below           the vaulted ceilings illustrate  The Evolution of the Book . As           you stand looking into the Great Hall, notice the progression, left to           right, from human memory to the spoken, written and printed word in human           history. Beneath the painting of  The Printing Press , depicting           Johann Gutenberg  (pictured in the image above right) , is a memorial           to the men of the Library of Congress who died in World War I.          Two           of the Library's great treasures, the  Gutenberg Bible   (shown           in the image on the left)  and the  Giant Bible of Mainz , are           displayed in separate cases here in the East Corridor. Both volumes were           produced in Mainz, Germany, in the mid-1450s; one is written by hand,           in manuscript, while the other is the first book printed with movable           metal type. The Library's three-volume Gutenberg Bible is one of three           perfect vellum copies in existence.          In the rear of the East Corridor is the former entrance to the Main Reading           Room, with paintings by Elihu Vedder depicting good and bad government           and the effects of each:  Anarchy ,  Corrupt Legislation ,            Government ,  Good Administration  and  Peace and Prosperity .          North Corridor          The           paintings in the North Corridor by Charles Sprague Pearce represent the           themes of a well-ordered and idyllic existence:  The Family ,  Recreation ,            Study ,  Labor ,  Religion  and  Rest . You           will also find the names and service dates of all the Librarians of Congress           inscribed on the wall below the group portrait of  The Family             (the painting on the right is entitled "" Recreation "") .           To the left of the engraving is a small doorway, above which is carved           the word  Librarian . This is the entrance to The Librarian's Room           (once the office for the Librarian of Congress), now used only for ceremonial           occasions.

The corridor to the right leads to three special-purpose rooms where           portions of the libraries of Ralph Ellison, Oliver Wendell Holmes and           Woodrow Wilson can be seen by special arrangement.          South Corridor          Here the paintings by Henry Oliver Walker honor poets. The names of American           poets, Longfellow to Poe, appear in wreaths in the mosaic of the vaulted           ceiling on the north side; ancient and non-American poets, Theocritus           to Ronsard and Browning to Heine, can be found in the central medallions           and the wreaths on the south side.          An           idyllic summer landscape occupies the west end of the corridor with three           seated female figures and a youth representing the moods of lyric poetry.           Wordsworth's words about poets are painted in the streamer over the landscape.           For the smaller lunettes on the north and south walls, Walker has painted           single youthful male figures suggested in various poems by English and           American poets: Milton and Shakespeare on the north wall and Tennyson,           Keats, Wordsworth and Emerson on the south side of the corridor. The mural           at the eastern end of the corridor shows  Lyric Poetry  surrounded           by her attributes -- Pathos, Truth, Devotion, Passion, Duty and Mirth            (shown on the left) . Inscribed in the marble beneath this painting           is a memorial to the men of the Library of Congress who died in World           War II. The corridor to the right, with The Members of Congress Room and           the Congressional Reading Room, is reserved for the use of members of           Congress.

GX244-55-9588686	"Building the Capitol Part: 3   Interior framing and brickwork of dome, April 1931.                       Since  the original planning of the complex there was agreement that the capitol would feature a dome and rotunda. Some of the state's officials became alarmed, however, when it was realized that the architect planned to have the dome covered with gold leaf. Gilbert asserted that the gilding was more appropriate to the building and would cost less in construction and maintenance than if stone were used. ""If we had built the dome of stone, as in the Arkansas Capitol,"" he said, ""or of marble, as in the Minnesota Capitol or the Rhode Island Capitol, it would have cost five or ten times as much money. In other words, the bell of the dome of this dimension in marble might easily have cost $500,000, whereas the comparatively modest expense for covering it with newly developed material of lead coated with copper and using gilding, has reduced the cost to a minimum... if the bell of the dome were of limestone it would be, in this climate, susceptible to expansion and contraction and the joints would have to be constantly repaired in order to preserve it."" Gilbert prevailed and he noted that several public buildings in the country, the Library of Congress at Washington and the state capitols at Boston, Massachusetts, and Trenton, New Jersey, were surmounted by gilded domes.    Dome interior near completion October 1931         Completed dome with chandelier, February 1932.                The dome  of our capitol was originally gilded in 1931 by the Mack, Jenney and Tyler Company for a sum of twenty-three thousand seven hundred dollars. Atop the crowning lantern of the dome is a bronze staff upon which is poised a golden eagle. In comparison with the dome that crowns our nation's capitol, West Virginia's stands most impressively. At two hundred and ninety-two feet, our~ dome is approximately four and one-half feet taller; however, the more compact-looking dome at Washington features a rotunda that is eighty-eight feet in diameter while West Virginia's is seventy-five feet. The top of our dome is one hundred and eighty feet from the ground floor, and hanging from a gold chain fiftyfour feet in length, is a four thousand pound chandelier composed almost entirely of beveled crystal. Directly below on the ground floor is a circular slab of marble that is the exact circumference of the chandelier.           Above Aerial view of dome as originally gilded, spring 1932.          The main unit  was connected to the east and west wings by one-story sections with basements, each measuring ninety-five feet in length by fifty-six feet in width. These sections, plus the central unit, more than doubled the existing space in the two wings, but despite the immense task of finishing the interior of the central unit as well as constructing the dome and rotunda, this facet of the complex was completed in less than two years.                  Senate Chamber 1991.    House of Delegates Chamber 1991          As he did in designing the supreme court chambers, the architect took particular care in shaping the spaces to be used by the two houses of the Legislature.                  Senate Foyer (leaf clusters seen in   ceiling represent sugar maple,   red oak and magnolia).   Rotunda well, February 1932.                          Liberally using various marbles in a classical motif and on a much grander scale than in the court spaces, the legislative foyers and chambers with the rotunda well in their middle, are the showcases of the complex. Occupying the main unit's most preferred spaces, the Senate is approached through an archway to the west of the rotunda, and the House of Delegates through the eastern archway. Matching foyers preview the actual chamber locations which are entered through massive marble columns. Each foyer ceiling is embellished with square coffered panels containing bronze-colored, plaster leaf arrangements that represent West Virginia hardwoods. The foyer walls consist of white Vermont marble topped with a series of carved symbols that represent aspects of the heritage of West Virginians. Pedestals of black and gold Belgian marble support translucent bowls of Italian alabaster that light the perimeters of the foyers and the rotunda. Offices for the legislative staffs and committee rooms are located off of the halls on both sides of the foyers and chambers, and also on the floor directly above. Stairways to the public galleries rise from the left and right of the chamber entrances, and in the chambers, the galleries are framed by massive arches that open on three sides of the room, with a fourth arch that serves as background for a dais. The walls are divided by panels of acoustic plaster, and the native leaf clusters figure in the decor within the contours of the arches.                     Carved symbols in frieze, legislative foyers and rotunda (representing agriculture, art, education, engineering, Indian lore, justice, mining, patriotism, peace and religion).        Identical chandeliers comprised of ten thousand pieces of rock crystal each, hang from the skylights in the center of the chambers. The lawmakers' desks and the speaker's and president's daises were built of West Virginia black walnut. The elaborately carved daises are trimmed with classical fretwork and feature fasces (Roman symbol of power) with eagles. The fretwork design can be seen throughout the capitol in the woodwork, bronzework, metal railings, and also as the border in the ceiling murals and some of the carved marble. Bronze light fixtures in the chambers are also based on the Roman fasces, and appear to be torches.             Contrasting cupola of the Senate Chamber and rectangular skylight of the House Chamber           Alabaster bowls are also used to light the chambers but differ from the ones in the foyers and rotunda in that their pedestals are of different types of marble. The pedestals and plinths in the Senate chambers are of a brownish Italian marble while those in the House of Delegates chambers are of a pink Georgian marble. The verd antique marble used in the design of the supreme court chambers is also used to form the wainscotting for the walls in the legislative chambers, and also in the steps leading to the daises. The most striking difference in the legislative chambers other than the number of desks and the alternating paint schemes, is the design of each  skylight. The Senate's is a domical ceiling, topped with a small cupola of stained glass; the skylight in the House of Delegates is flat and rectangular, also consisting of glass panels.           The primary entrance to the capitol is the one from the south, or the Kanawha River side, it is protected by a monumental Corinthian portico and balanced on the north side by a similar entrance, both of which are approached by broad flights of steps. Under the south steps is a private entrance or porte cochere; the driveway is designated for the governor's use. The main entrances open into the rotunda on the principal floor (the first floor or the story above the ground level) to a circular arched hall directly below the dome. A balustrade of white marble encircles the rotunda well through which can be seen a colonnaded hall on the floor below. The floors of the main unit are inlaid with Italian travertine marble and the white Vermont marble used in the walls and columns of the interior. The previously mentioned east and west arches open to the legislative foyers and the north and south are openings to the porticoes; the arches extend to the base of the dome and are adorned with panels of deep-blue plaster. These areas in and between the arches form pendentive brackets and in many public buildings of similar design these areas are decorated with murals. Above this space is more carved marble that forms a frieze at the dome's base, and further up is a wrought iron railing adorned with a bronze guilloche and bronze fasces that encircle the dome interior. Gold leaf bands also encircle the drum and ceiling of the dome, and a row of slender windows covered with gold-leaf grilles gird the dome at the base of the bell.             The outer walls of the main unit, like those of the wings constructed of Indiana select buff limestone, are adorned with pairs of Doric pilasters, two stories in height, which rise in support of the main cornice. On either side of the dome are flat roofs enclosed by a balustraded parapet that are broken by the porticoed central section. The pediments above the main entrances are not graced with sculpture but are rimmed with ornamental terra cotta, and the high crowning dome continues the tradition of the lines of the United States Capitol. Gilbert visited the site in November of 1931 expressing pleasure with the progress of construction and noting the spirit of cooperation and accomplishment that had brought the project near completion. The 558 feet long and 120 feet wide central unit was ready for occupancy in the early part of 1932, and Gilbert returned to the site in January of that year and was photographed with the governor and building commission on the grounds outside the governor's offices during that visit. Unfortunately, the architect was not given enough prior notice for the day of dedication, and because of other commitments could not attend the ceremony held on West Virginia's sixty-ninth birthday."

The murals were designed by August Knorr, a Des Moines   decorator, who was responsible for decorating the State Capitol in the   1880s.  Knorr’s designs were sent to Germany to painter Fritz Melzer who   was “much in vogue as a decorative artist” at the time.  The murals are   oil paint on linen canvas.  They cost $949.76 in 1886.             Themes of Justice.     The largest mural, entitled Columbia, shows Columbia   sitting on her throne, which is perched on a large globe.  To her left   is Justice, paying homage, and to her right is Iowa holding a club and a coat   of arms, ready to defend Columbia.                     Columbia                 Another large mural shows Justice and Peace seated   together in a throne atop clouds. Justice holds a scale in one hand and a   sword in her other hand, poised ready to strike.  Peace looks on   serenely as a partially robed man whose face is said to resemble President   Ulysses S. Grant puts down a one-man Roman rebellion.               Justice and Peace           The third large mural shows Justice seated at her   throne.  She is holding a scale in one hand and a sword in the   other.  To her left stands Columbia who holds a shield decorated in   stars and stripes.  Columbia is standing ready to defend Justice’s   decisions.  To the right of Justice stands a woman who is rejoicing   because the decision was in her favor.  Another figure is grieving   because the decision was against her.                 Justice           A medium sized mural, depicts a reclining, partially nude   Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.                     Ceres                                   There are six small oval murals, each contains a cherubic   looking child called a “genius” (a tutelary deity or guardian spirit).    Each genius is engaged in an agricultural task.  The six ovals were   originally located around the Ceres mural.                                                                                                                                           The Fire—1904.     The murals were removed from the courtroom in 1904 after a   fire that damaged the House chambers one floor above the courtroom, and were   placed in storage.  In 1907, the murals were installed in the old State   Historical Building.           Restoration—2001.     The Supreme Court retained Art conservator (and former   Iowan) Randy Ash of Denver, Colorado, to remove the murals, clean and   stabilize them, and prepare them for installation in the new building.    Ash and an assistant worked around the clock for one week in mid-December to   carefully peel the murals off the walls and wrap them for shipping.           According to Ash, the murals were mounted directly on the   wall with a simple adhesive probably made from wheat flour and water.    Because the adhesive had substantially deteriorated, Ash was able to pull the   murals off the wall using a cake spatula and artist’s knife.   Some   of the murals had cuts and tears that likely occurred when they were removed   from the Capitol.  Prior to removal, Ash secured the tears with a   special conservation tool — duct tape.           Ash attributes much of the dark appearance of the murals   to smoke damage from the 1904 fire.  In addition, when the murals were   installed in the Old Historical Building, an artist painted the wall   surrounding the murals to create a larger background.  The artist even   took care to mix the paint so that it matched the dark colors caused by the   smoke damage.             After the murals were cleaned and restored, Ash mounted   them on aluminum honeycomb panels so that in the future they can be easily   moved.             The restoration project will cost up to $174,000.    Funds for the project came from the building construction budget as part of   the mandatory art requirement for new State buildings.                                                                                                                                                Home  |        Supreme Court  |    Court of Appeals  |    District Courts  |    About Our Courts          Our Judges  |    News  |     Judicial Branch Building  |      Families & Children         Attorney Regulation  |     Court Rules  |     Court Administration               ©2001 Iowa Court Information System     Contact Us

In 1800 only the north wing of the Capitol was finished.  The books brought by Congress from Philadelphia and the new books acquired for the Library were placed in the office of the Clerk of the Senate.  During 1801, a temporary structure was built for the use of the House of Representatives, and the act of January 26, 1802, which established the rules and procedures ""concerning the Library for the use of both Houses of Congress,"" provided for the move of the Library into the room in the north wing formerly occupied by the House.  Here the Library remained until December 1805.       Neptune, his son Triton, and various sea nymphs, as realized  by sculptor Roland Hinton Perry, glow under artificial light in this  nighttime photograph of  the Court of Neptune  Fountain in front of the Jefferson Building.  (Photograph by  Reid Baker)       The Library of Congress occupied various spaces in the Capitol building between 1806 and August 24, 1814, when the British burned the Capitol and the Library.  On January 30, 1815 Thomas Jefferson's library was purchased by Congress to ""recommence"" its library, and a law approved on March 3, 1815, authorized the preparation of ""a proper apartment"" for the books.  Blodget's Hotel at 7th and E Streets was serving as the temporary Capitol, and a room on its third floor became the new location of the Library of Congress.  Here Jefferson's books were received and organized by Librarian of Congress George Watterston.  On February 18, 1817, Library Committee chairman Eligius Fromentin, a senator from Louisiana, introduced a resolution advocating a separate building for the Library, but it failed.  In late 1818, however, funds were appropriated to move the Library back into the Capitol.       A stairway in the Great Hall of the  Library of Congress, Thomas Jefferson Building,  which was designed to  demonstrate America's love of learning, science, work, and  culture. (Photograph by Reid Baker)      The new quarters in the attic story of the Capitol's north wing proved inadequate.  In January 1818 Charles Bulfinch became Architect of the Capitol and he soon developed plans for a spacious library room in the center of the west front of the Capitol.  The new room, which measured 90 feet in length and 30 feet wide, was occupied on August 17, 1824.  On December 22, 1825, a fire started by a candle left burning in the gallery was controlled before it could cause serious damage.  Investigations into fireproofing the room concluded that the expense would be too great.  In 1832 a separate ""apartment"" was established for the law collection.   On Christmas Eve, 1851, the Library of Congress suffered a disastrous fire.  Approximately thirty-five thousand of its fifty-five thousand volumes were destroyed in the flames, which were caused by a faulty chimney flue.  Architect of the Capitol Thomas U. Walter presented a plan, approved by Congress, to repair and enlarge the Library room using fireproof materials throughout.  The elegantly restored Library room was opened on August 23, 1853.  Called by the press the ""largest iron room in the world,"" it was encircled by galleries and filled the west central front of the Capitol.  A month before the opening, Pres. Franklin Pierce inspected the new Library in the company of British scientist Sir Charles Lyell, who pronounced it ""the most beautiful room in the world.""        This drawing of the old Congressional  Reading Room by W. Bengough appeared in  Harper's Weekly  on  February 27, 1897.   Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford is  depicted at the far right, emerging from his desk area with a  book for a  reader.  The man holding the lamp is David Hutcheson, Assistant  Librarian.     In 1865, Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford obtained approval for expanding the Library by adding two new fireproof wings.  The copyright law of 1870 brought two copies of all copyright items to the Library, however, and it immediately became apparent to Librarian Spofford that the Library would soon run out of space.  He suggested a separate building and, in 1872 presented a plan to Congress for such a structure.  In 1875, he reported to Congress that the Library had exhausted all shelf space and that ""books are now, from sheer force of necessity, being piled on the floor in all directions.""  Unless Congress took quick action on the question of a separate building, he noted, its Librarian would soon be placed ""in the unhappy predicament of presiding over the greatest chaos in America.""      The Jefferson Building  The first separate Library of Congress Building, the Jefferson Building, was suggested by Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford in 1871, authorized in 1886, and completed in 1897. When its doors were opened to the public on November 1, 1897, it represented an unparalleled national achievement: its 23-carat gold-plated dome capped the ""largest, costliest, and safest"" library building in the world.  Its elaborately decorated facade and interior, for which more than forty American painters and sculptors could surpass European libraries in grandeur and devotion to classical culture.  A contemporary guidebook boasted: ""America is justly proud of this gorgeous and palatial monument to its National sympathy and appreciation of Literature, Science, and Art.  It has been designed and executed entirely by American art and American labor (and is) a fitting tribute for the great thoughts of generations past, present, and to be.""  This new national Temple of the Arts immediately met with overwhelming approval from the American public.   Known as the Library of Congress (or Main) Building until it was named for Thomas Jefferson, the Library's principal founder, in 1980, the structure was built specifically to serve as the American national library, and its architecture and decoration express and enhance that purpose.  A national library for the United States was the dream and goal of Librarian Spofford; the new building was a crucial step in his achievement.  It was a functional, state-of-the-art structure as well as a Temple of the Arts, using the latest technology throughout.   The early years of planning and construction were filled with controversy and delay.  After two design competitions and a decade of debate about design and location, in 1886 Congress finally chose an Italian Renaissance plan submitted by Washington architects John L. Smithmeyer and Paul J. Pelz.  Structurally the architects followed the basic idea proposed by Librarian Spofford: a circular, domed reading room at the Library's various departments.  In the final Smithmeyer & Pelz plan, the reading room was enclosed by rectangular exterior walls, which divided the open space into four courtyards.         In 1986 work began on a massive renovation of the Thomas  Jefferson Building as it approached its one hundredth birthday in  1997.   The heart of that building, the Main  Reading Room, is shown before renovation.   (Photograph by Marita  Clance)  Pictured here, the renovation, undertaken in stages,  painstakingly in progress.   The Main Reading Room reopened in  1991.  (Photograph by Reid Baker)     Disputes continued after the building was authorized in 1886.  Responsibility for clearing the site was unclear (several buildings had to be razed) and Capitol landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted protested the building's location, which shut out ""the whole view of the Capitol building from Pennsylvania Avenue-the main approach from Capitol hill.""  Another controversy, this one about the selection of the proper cement for the foundation, proved to be architect Smithmeyer's undoing, and he was dismissed in 1888.  The building's construction was placed under the direction of Brig. Gen. Thomas Lincoln Casey, Chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Casey and his Superintendent of Construction, civil engineer Bernard R. Green, had successfully completed the construction of the Washington Monument and the State, War, and Navy (now the Old Executive Office) Building and were trusted by the Congress.  The cornerstone was laid in 1890.  Paul Pelz, who replaced Smithmeyer as architect in 1888, was himself dismissed in 1892 by architect Edward Pearce Casey, General Casey's son, who supervised most of the interior decoration.   Known primarily for their ability to keep construction costs to a minimum, General Casey and Bernard Green were infused with a nationalism which complemented Spofford's national library aspirations. They viewed the interior art work as a necessary component in carrying out the building's monumental design and purpose.  They also wanted to give American artists an opportunity to display their talents, and employed no less than forty-two American sculptors and painters ""to fully and consistently carry out the monumental design and purpose of the building.""  In a report to Congress in 1896, Superintendent Green stated that the total cost of the mural and decorative painting, the sculpture, and the three massive bronze doors at the main entrance (representing Tradition, Writing, and Painting), was $364,000.  In addition, Hinton Perry's fifty-foot wide fountain in front of the building, which depicts a scene in the court of Neptune, cost $22,000.  The price of gilding the dome, including the flame of the Torch of Learning at its apex, was $3,800.  Yet, the building was still completed for $200,000 less than the total congressional authorization of approximately $6,500,000.    Since 1897, the gilded copper dome has been replaced, and three of the four interior courtyards of the Jefferson Building have been filled.  The east courtyards have become bookstacks: the southeast bookstack was completed in 1910, the northeast in 1927.  The Coolidge Auditorium, opened in 1925, and the Whittall Pavilion, opened in 1939, occupy the northwest courtyard.  The east side of the Jefferson building was extended in the early 1930s providing new quarters for the Rare Book Room when construction was completed in 1934.  The Main Reading Room was closed for renovation in 1964-65.  In 1984, Congress appropriated $81.5 million for the renovation and restoration of the Jefferson and Adams buildings.  Work started in 1986 and is scheduled for completion in 1995.   The Jefferson Building is a heroic setting for a national institution.  Today it is generally recognized as a unique blending of art and architecture, a structure that celebrated the universality of knowledge and symbolizes American turn-of-the- century optimism.  The elaborate embellishment of its interior is worth careful attention, for a few structures represents human thought and aspiration in such dramatic fashion.      The Adams Building  In 1928, at the urging of Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam, Congress authorized the purchase of land directly east of the Library's Main Building for the construction of an Annex Building.  In 1930, $6,500,000 was appropriated for its construction, for a tunnel connecting it to the Main Building, and for certain changes in the east front of the Main Building, including the construction of the Rare Book Room.  An additional appropriation in 1935 brought the total provision of funds to cover $8 million.  The simple classical structure was intended, essentially, as a functional and efficient bookstack ""encircled with work spaces.""  It was designed by the Washington architectural firm of Pierson & Wilson with Alexander Buel Trowbridge as a consulting architect.  The contract completion by June 24, 1938, but the building was not ready for occupancy until December 2, 1938.  The move of the Card Division started on December 12, and it opened its doors for business to the public in the new building on January 3, 1939.       The second Library building, originally called the Annex  Building, was renamed for man of letters and second president of the  United States John Adams in 1980.   The building's  bronze doors  are decorated with representations, by sculptor Lee Lawrie,  of historical figures credited with giving the art of writing to their people since ancient times. (Photograph by Reid Baker)     On April 13, 1976, in a ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial marking the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, President Ford signed into law the act to change the name of the Library of Congress Annex Building to the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building.  In 1980, the structure acquired its present name, which honors John Adams, the man of letters and president of the United States who in 1800 approved the law establishing the Library of Congress.   The dignified exterior of the Adams Building is faced  with white Georgia marble.  Its twelve tiers of stacks provide about thirteen acres of shelf space and shelf capacity for about ten million books.        The North Reading Room on the fifth  floor of the Adams Building  holds a reference collection focused  primarily on business and economics, political science, education, and  sociology.  Among its most prominent decorative elements are  near-life-size paintings of all Chaucer's Canterbury pilgrims by artist  Ezra Winter. (Photograph by Reid Baker)     Today, the building's decorative style, which contains element of ""Art Deco"" inspired by the Exposition des Arts Dècoratifs held in Paris in 1925, is widely admired.  The history of the written word is depicted in sculptured figures by Lee Lawrie on the bronze doors at the west (Second Street) and east (Third Street) entrances.  Decorative features in the first floor lobbies and corridors and in the fifth floor lobbies and reading rooms are worth special note.   On the fifth floor, the north reading room is decorated by murals by artist Ezra Winter that illustrate the characters in Geoffrey Chaucer's  Canterbury Tales.    Four murals by Ezra Winter decorate the South Reading Room.  The theme is  drawn from the quotations from Thomas Jefferson's writings which are  inscribed in the murals and reflect Jefferson's thoughts on Freedom, Labor, the Living Generation, Education, and Democratic Government.  The characters and costumes depicted are those of Jefferson's time.  A portrait of Jefferson with his residence, Monticello, in the background is in a lunette over the reference desk at the north end of the room.        The northern lunette in the South  Reading Room of the Adams Building dedicates the room to Thomas  Jefferson.   Murals by Ezra Winter and devoted to Jefferson  decorate all the reading room walls, accompanied by side panels  containing Jefferson's writings which demonstrate the breadth of his  interests and his philosophy. (Photograph by Reid Baker)     On the left half of the panel of the east wall, Jefferson's view on Freedom:    The ground of Liberty is to be gained by inches. We must be contented to secure what we can get from time to time and eternally press forward for what is yet to get. It takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good.  Jefferson to Rev. Charles Clay, January 27,  1790     His views on Labor also are on the east wall:         Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of god,  if he ever had a chosen people, whose breasts he has made the peculiar deposits for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in which he keeps alive that sacred fire which otherwise might escape from the earth.  From  Notes on Virginia,  1782     On the south wall, the panel over the clock contains a quotation about the Living Generation:    The earth belongs always to the living generation. They  manage it then, and what proceeds form it, as they please during their usufruct.  They are masters too of their own persons, and consequently may govern them as they please.  Jefferson to James Madison, September 6,  1789    On the left half of the panel on the west wall, Jefferson's view of Education is illustrated by the quotation:    Educate and inform the mass of the people. Enable them to see that it is their interest to preserve peace and order, and they will preserve them.  Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppression of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.  Jefferson to James Madison, December 20, 1787 (first two sentences)  Jefferson to P.S. Dupont de Nemours, April 24, 1816 (last  sentence)     Jefferson's views on Democratic Government, also on the west wall, are illustrated by the quotation:    The people of every country are the only safe guardians of  their own rights, and are the only instruments which can be used for their destruction.  It is an axiom in my mind that our liberty can never be safe but in the hands of the people themselves, that, too of the people with a certain degree of  instruction.  Jefferson to John Wyche, May 19, 1809 (first sentence)  Jefferson to George Washington, January 4, 1786 (second  sentence)       The James Madison Memorial Building  In 1957, Librarian of Congress L. Quincy Mumford initiated studies for a third Library building.  Congress appropriated planning funds for that structure, today's James Madison Memorial Building, in 1960 and construction was authorized in 1965.  The cornerstone was laid in 1974 and Pres. Ronald Reagan participated in dedication ceremonies on November 20, 1981, when the building was completed.  The building serves both as the Library's third major structure and as this nation's official memorial to James Madison, the ""father"" of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the fourth president of the United States.       The James Madison Memorial Building is the Library's newest  building and the nation's official memorial to Madison -- fourth  president of the United States and ""Father of the U.S. Constitution.""   This statue by Walter Hancock is the most prominent  feature on the first floor of the building.   Eight quotes from  Madison are written on the surrounding walls. (Photograph by  Reid Baker)     That a major Library of Congress building should also become a memorial to James Madison is fitting, for the institution's debt to him is considerable.  In 1783, as a member of the Continental Congress by proposing a list of books that would be useful to legislators, an effort that preceded by seventeen years the establishment of the Library of Congress.  In 1815, Madison was president of the United States and a keen observer when the library of his close personal friend and collaborator, Thomas Jefferson, became the foundation of a enlightened statesman who believed the power of knowledge was essential for individual liberty and democratic government.   Two quotations from Madison about knowledge, liberty, and learning, are located on each side of the main entrance of the Madison Building on Independence Avenue.   On the left side of the main entrance:    Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who  mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.  Madison to W. T. Barry, August 4, 1822    On the right side of the entrance:    What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of liberty and learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual and surest support?  Madison to W. T. Barry, August 4, 1822    Modern in style, the Madison Building was designed by the firm of DeWitt, Poor and Shelton, Associated Architects.  It is one of the three largest public buildings in the  Washington, D.C., area (the others are the Pentagon and the F.B.I. Building), and contains 2,100,000 square feet with 1,500,000 square feet of assignable space.  It houses administrative offices, including the Office of the Librarian, as well as the Copyright Office, the Congressional Research Service, and the Law Library.  The building also holds the Library's map, manuscript, music, motion picture, newspaper, and graphic arts collections, and eight of the Library's reading rooms.        The Madison Building  houses the  Librarian's Office, the Copyright Office, the Congressional Research  Service, the Law Library, and a variety of special collections.  The  building's sixth floor cafeteria and dining rooms are available to  tourists as well as congressional staff, its meeting rooms are often the  scenes of free poetry readings and panel discussions, and its exhibition  areas and constantly filled with treasures from the Library's  collections. (Photograph by Jim Higgins)     Over the main entrance is four-story relief in  bronze, ""Falling Books,"" by Frank Eliscu.  Off the entrance hall to the immediate left is the James Madison Memorial Hall, which has eight quotations from Madison on its walls.  A heroic statue by Walter Hancock in the center portrays Madison as a young man in his thirties, holding in his right hand volume 83 of the  Encyclopédie Méthodique , which was published in Paris  between 1782-1832.  At the end of the entrance hall, above the doorways to the Manuscript Reading Room and the Manuscript Division office, are a pair of bronze medallions by Robert Alexander Weinmann.

GX234-02-14955953	An                exhibit artist works closely with scientists, such as curators of                natural history, to create murals, dioramas, and other background                paintings that are both scientifically accurate and artistically                pleasing.                The                function of the murals is to teach natural history to the public.                The artist works with the exhibit designer and technician to make                sure the painting can be incorporated well into the structure of                the exhibit.                 Robert                G. Larson                  As a boy Robert Larson always liked art and wild animals. When visiting                museums, he saw that the two interests could be combined. He studied                Fine Art at the Layton School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In the 1930s                he sent some of his practice wildlife drawings to F.L. Jaques, a                staff member of the American Museum of Natural History. Mr. Jaques                critiqued the drawings and became a mentor for Mr. Larson as he                began his career.                Robert                Larson started working as an exhibit artist for the Illinois State                Museum in 1962 and after retiring in 1987, continues to paint murals                for the Museum today. He began the first mural about the Ice Age                in Illinois in 1977. Today he is working to complete a total of                six large paintings. The first was the  Midwestern United States                16,000 . Five smaller ones are in production.                The                Murals                  The murals will show several periods in various places in Illinois                during the Ice Age. Three are complete and show:                               Woolly                  mammoths, flat-headed peccaries, a sabertooth, and California                  condors in a southeastern Illinois scene of 30,000 years ago                 Muskoxen,                  caribou, and a snowy owl in a glacial moraine area of northeastern                  Illinois 17,000 years ago                  A                  giant beaver, a thirteen-lined ground squirrel, wolves, and a                  pair of stag moose in LaSalle County in north-central Illinois                  16,000 years ago                             Two                others will be:                                A                  scene in Jo Daviess County in northwestern Illinois 30,000 years                  ago                  A                  scene set in Montgomery County in central Illinois 105,000 years                  ago                              These                scenes have to be reconstructed from geological and biological evidence                found in those areas. Mr. Larson collaborates with the curators                of palynology and paleontology. Those scientists will decide what                animals and vegetation are appropriate for the place and the time                of each scene.                Mr.                Larson will study plant, animal, and rock specimens in the Museum's                collection. He will also go to the sites in various parts of the                state and make sketches and take photographs of how the areas look                today. The basic landforms will be similar to the ones in the areas                during the Ice Age.                He                will use the facts and details of the scientists' information as                a basis for a detailed and accurate painting. The ability of the                artist to also create a pleasing composition with good design elements                of color, shape, perspective, and value is what turns the finished                mural into a work of art.                Characteristics                of a Good                 Natural History Exhibit Artist                  Mr. Larson says it is important that the artist knows wildlife,                be an amateur or a trained naturalist, and know geography. It is                also beneficial to have a background knowledge of fine art and wildlife                art.                The                ability to work as a team is very important in this career. The                artist is not making paintings for himself or herself alone, but                for an audience of museum visitors who are learning about natural                history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Copyright © 2000 Illinois State  Museum Society

A collaborative project of the Ohio Arts Council, Ohio Alliance for Arts Education and Ohio Department of Education has received a $420,000 grant under the Jacob K. Javitz Gifted and Talented Students Program of the U.S. Department of Education. The three-year project will provide arts instruction and talent development for artistically gifted students.           ( CONT'D       P AGE   2 )                                        Portsmouth and the Southern Ohio Museum participated in         Artists & Communities: America Creates for the Millennium.  The national project gives       communities across America opportunities to address their concerns by       working directly with some of the nation's most innovative communicators and       problem solvers - artists.         Artists & Communities  involves more than 50       artists in residence working collaboratively with organizations in all 50 states and six jurisdictions.         Representing Ohio, the Southern Ohio Museum hosted visiting visual artist       Natasha Mayers of Whitefield, Maine, who began her three-month stay in       Portsmouth in August. Her residency was part of the National Endowment for       the Arts and Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation's millennium celebration efforts.       The White House Millennium Council has designated the program an official millennium project.               The Portsmouth site was chosen through a competition conducted by the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation and the Ohio Arts Council. Designed to expand and support the roles of the arts in Americans' daily lives, Artists and Communities leverages the power of professional artists to give communities new ways to address local issues through collaborative creation of new works of art.                   Mayers worked with many groups of local residents to generate dialogue about an issue relevant to the Portsmouth area, producing art that reveals the heritage, cultural history, ethnic identity or social concerns of various neighborhoods in the community.           With coordination and planning by the Southern Ohio Museum staff, Mayers worked with senior citizens, families, minorities and teens, designing significant new works of art and providing creative solutions to bridge communication gaps among cross sections of the community.

The formal dedication of the structure took place          in April 1962. Early on, officials decided that the building deserved          a special piece of commemorative art reflecting the history of the Lone          Star State. The Texas Library and Historical Commission and the State          Building Commission envisioned a large-scale painting to depict the story          of Texas. The commissioners contacted the well-known southwestern artist          Peter Hurd of New Mexico to paint the mural. When it became evident that          the project required rigorous physical activities, the 65 year old artist          requested that the commission be passed on to his son-in-law, Peter Rogers,          to do the final painting. This request was granted.           The mural was completed in three months during the summer of 1964. Rogers          and Hurd spent several months studying Texas history before Rogers actually          began painting the mural, which conveys 400 years in Texas, from conquistadors          to cowboys.            Rogers          begins in the left corner with the small ship coming in from the sea,          bringing some of the first settlers and missionaries, shown trying to          ""civilize"" the Indians. The figure of the conquistador symbolizes the          large part the French and Spanish explorers had in our history. Behind          him, a group of Indians are sitting in front of their tipis. The blue          design around the front tipi indicates the chief's residence and what          appear to be tassels on top of the poles extending from the top are actually          scalps. Buffalo jerky is hanging up to dry above the woman to the right.                   Stephen          F. Austin is shown for his participation in the settlement of Texas, bringing          over 300 families to this area. The characters behind him represent the          different types of people that came to Texas with their various means          of travel.            The          small group of Indians on the warpath -- traveling in the opposite direction          of the flow of the painting -- represent the Indians' opposition to the          White man's settlement of the land.            The          center portion of the mural depicts Texas fighting for independence from          Mexico and eventual statehood (symbolized by the man carrying the flag          of the Republic, which became the state flag). In this scene, Sam Houston          takes center stage because of his victory at the Battle of San Jacinto.          Behind him are the heroes of the Alamo: Travis in the blue uniform, David          Crockett and Jim Bowie. The sky over the Alamo is shown the way it looked          at the actual time of the battle; Santa Anna attacked at 4 a.m. and that          is the reason for the pre-dawn darkness. Mr. Rogers even did research          to determine the phase of the moon at the time of the battle. The flames          behind the Alamo represent the fires of revolution.            The          young man lying face down to the left of Houston not only symbolizes all          the fallen fighters, but it is also a self-portrait. By painting his own          image into the mural, Peters Rogers was following a long-standing tradition          of artists to include their own images in large works, usually in unflattering          situations.           The next scene shows Texas developing her resources and becoming a state.          The cowboy takes us into the trail-driving days. The rope around the longhorn          represents our beginning to control the land and the windmill became a          trademark for developing it. The small steam engine in the background          indicates more people and new industry coming to Texas.            The          man on the left in the last scene is Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president          of the Republic of Texas (Sam Houston was the first). It is said that          no matter you stand in the lobby of the building, the eyes of Lamar will          appear to be staring directly at you. On his right is Anson Jones, the          last president of the Republic. Jones was a noted politician and physician          who played a key role in bringing Texas into the Union in 1845.            The          woman with the child represents the United States bringing Texas into          the Union as a young state. (Peter Rogers used his wife Carol as a model          for this woman.) Originally, Mr. Rogers was going to depict Texas as a          baby, but then he decided that Texas had been getting along on its own          for nearly 10 years as an independent republic, so he changed it to a          child to show more growth and development. Behind her is the United States          flag, on which Texas is the 28th star.           In the corner is the state flower, the bluebonnet. The other plants          are those typically found in Texas: the yucca and century plant. The bales          of cotton represent the cotton industry introduced to Texas and the two          men in front of the white building are confederate soldiers symbolizing          Texas' contribution to the Civil War.            The          sheep and oil wells on the far right show new growth and development that          launched Texas into a greater industrial era.           The artistry of Peter Rogers and Peter Hurd compresses 400 years of          Texas history into a compelling and comprehensive panorama. Their colorful          vision of Texas' past will continue to impress visitors to the state's          Archives and Library building for generations to come.

After studying primitive art forms, from Egyptian hieroglyphics to Northwest Coastal Indian form-line art, the students created their own imaginary creatures. The panels were painted to look like textured stone or ancient cedar.    The Shoreline Chamber of Commerce Community Development Committee selected the student's depiction of Native American art for the Chamber's Beautification Award in 1991.

GX025-98-7916886	Paducah                      Parks Department: Festival of Murals                     This                      annual event is centered around a living history drama performed                      in front of the murals decorating the city's flood wall. The                      20 murals themselves,the work of artist Robert Dafford, are                      a rich legacy, painted to represent different periods of Paducah's                      history and providing the finishing touch to the extensive                      riverfront restoration of the early 90s. Held since 1997,                      each dramatization brings to life figures from Kentucky's                      history as they step out from the murals. Other events such                      as a band concert and fireworks enliven the festival. It is                      documented in historical text, photographs, news clippings,                      brochures, and a videotape from the 1999 festival titled  Portraits                      in Time III.                                                                                                                                                                              Local          Legacies Home   >  States          Listing  >  Project Titles  >          Project Abstract
GX025-98-1305996	Portsmouth Flood Wall Mural Project -                      Ohio Legacies Captured in Art                     During                      1992, a group of citizens, led by Dr. Louis R. and Ava Chaboudy,                      imagined that painting murals depicting the history of the                      Portsmouth area on the drab Boneyfiddle floodwall would contribute                      to the cultural quality of life within the community. It would                      also encourage the restoration effort of the historic part                      of town, Boneyfiddle, and enhance tourism. Robert Dafford,                      an internationally known muralist from Lafayette, Louisiana,                      was contracted for project, funded by both individual and                      corporate contributors, and grants from several government                      arts organizations.                      The                      first mural was completed in 1993. The murals are arranged                      chronologically from east to west, starting with the depiction                      of the Mound Builders, who are ancestors of the Shawnee Indians.                      A more recent mural depicts a modern day scene of one of Ohio's                      river bridges. Other subjects are a Shawnee Indian village,                      a view of the Ohio Canal, and a Civil War scene. By 1999,                      forty murals covering 32,840 square feet had been completed.                      Approximately fifteen more murals, covering 10,540 square                      feet, will be completed by fall of 2002, in time for the bicentennial                      celebrations in Scioto County and Ohio.                      Dafford                      and his team of artisans research mural subjects by studying                      old photographs from the Carl Akerman collection at the Southern                      Museum and Cultural Center; and photographs, pictures, books,                      and post cards from private collections and the Shawnee State                      University library. Dafford also gains insight for his work                      from discussions he has with senior citizens and local groups                      who have knowledge about particular mural subjects.                      Documentation                      includes a nine-page report and 12 photographs of murals.                                                                                                                                                                                 Local          Legacies Home   >  States          Listing  >  Project Titles  >          Project Abstract

GX023-08-2519959	"LC INFORMATION BULLETIN  May 5 - May 19, 1997             ..........   Portrait of the Artist    Dodge's Murals Helped Create  'National Monument of Art'    by Leftwich Dodge Kimbrough    Following is an article about one of the artists commissioned to work on the Thomas Jefferson Building. Leftwich Dodge Kimbrough's grandfather, William de Leftwich Dodge (1867-1935), painted the murals in the Northwest Pavilion.       A portrait of Dodge, ca. 1898, by American sculptor and painter Frederick MacMonnies, painted in his garden at Giverny, France. Dodge said he was ""overjoyed"" when he received the Library commission, and took nearly two years to complete the work.       ""The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., was the first important government building to be decorated in accordance with the idea of the unity of the arts -- an idea introduced on a grand scale by the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893,"" said the March 1897  Century  magazine.    ""The national library provided a perfect opportunity to display the newly popular art of mural painting and to introduce a public art based on broadly humanistic themes. The concept of culture as the best that man has thought or said was essentially bookish, and there was no more appropriate place to demonstrate this concept, as it was expressed by visual art, than in a library.    ""The extensive program of mural painting and sculpture at the Library of Congress, carried out between 1895 and 1897, was made possible through the efficiency of General Thomas Lincoln Casey, who was able to include the decoration within the $6 million allotted for the building. Edward Pearce Casey, General Casey's son, coordinated the program of painting and sculpture and chose the artists. The project was huge; in 1895, 19 artists were commissioned to paint a total of 112 murals. At the same time 22 sculptors worked on their commissions and seven artists were employed for the ornamental decorations. The scene was filled with the spirit of the 'American Renaissance.' As one critic noted, 'The artists, like the workmen, were in overalls, and the atmosphere of the place seemed impregnated with the spirit of art and labor. It was something as it must have been in Florence or Venice in the Renaissance.'""    In 1975, the Smithsonian Institution mounted an exhibition called ""Art for Architecture: Washington, D.C., 1895-1925."" Referring to the work done on the Jefferson Building, the exhibition catalog said: ""Although the painters were well known and in the forefront of American art, they were paid only nominal amounts, ranging from $2,200 to $8,000, depending on the amount of space they were to cover. In the opinion of most of the mural painters, the library murals were a patriotic effort and seed work for the future.    ""The Library of Congress provided an important example of total decoration for architects and artists for the next several decades,"" the catalog text continued. ""Allegorical and symbolic compositions based on humanistic themes of culture, civilization and literature, first coordinated at the Library of Congress, became a standard repertory for government buildings, libraries, and even private residences until the 1930s.""    According to William de Leftwich Dodge's daughter, Sara Dodge Kimbrough, in  Drawn from Life,  ""Having successfully completed his first murals for the architect Richard Morris Hunt's Administration Building at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where he was the youngest artist, and anxious to marry Fanny Bland Pryor, William de Leftwich Dodge was determined to secure one of 50 contracts for decorative work at the Library in 1895. At the time he was living and painting in Paris, where costs were less than those in New York City. As usual he was optimistic. After submitting numerous sketches, he received a commission to paint the murals in the library's Northwest Pavilion, consisting of a dome -- 25 by 25 feet [Ambition, below] and four tympanums -- each 10 by 35 feet (Literature, Music, Science and Art) [murals, below].    ""Shortly thereafter, he was sitting in an outdoor cafe in Paris with his friend the sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, who was later to design one of the three bronze doors ('The Art of Printing') for the main entrance to the building. 'You see, Mac, in the ceiling sketch Ambition [below], the whole thing symbolizes human life. You know, human beings are never satisfied when they reach the top rung of the ladder. That's the meaning of the people who with outstretched arms are still reaching up beyond and looking toward'"" the figure holding a crown astride a winged horse.    ""'Bully, Dodge. I don't see how you do it!' exclaimed Mac.    'Let me explain the rest,' Dodge continued hurriedly. 'Over here this jester [below] is laughing at the ambitious ones, for he believes, as the crowned skull [atop a scepter] in his hand indicates, that fame comes only after death to those who have slaved during life.'            ""Ambition"" by William de Leftwich Dodge measures 25 feet across and is in the Northwest Pavilion, along with Dodge's four tympanums; a study (left) for the reaching figure (at bottom, right of center); and a study for the jester, who holds a scepter topped by a skull, used for the one seen in the mural on the far right.  (Color photo courtesy Architech of the Capitol)       'When do you think of all these ideas?' asked Mac. 'I see you at l'Ely's or Bal Bulliers almost every night.'    'Well, I'm not wasting my time with the girls now. When I get my last payment of the $8,000 allotted for the Library job I'll have enough to marry Fan. Her father, the old judge, has at last given his consent,' said Father with a broad smile.""    Dodge's Library ceiling canvas, ""Ambition,"" was initially exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1896; then it was shown at the American Art Galleries before it was sent to Washington. At the time the  New York Herald  wrote, ""The composition is excellent, very fine in tone, and it would seem by his successful work that Mr. Dodge is reaching after the Chariot himself!""    According to Dodge's daughter, ""He wanted to communicate definite ideas and felt that murals were the best media wherein the artist could speak directly to the people.""    As Dodge was quoted in  The American Art Journal,  ""I was overjoyed at being recognized by the government. It took me nearly two years to execute the job.""    The seed for Dodge's interest in mural decoration was sown when he was 12, in 1879. That year, his mother, Mary de Leftwich Dodge, an aspiring artist, moved her family from their home in Virginia to Europe. After living initially in Munich they moved to Paris, where many Americans went to study art at either the state-operated Ecole des Beaux-Arts or at one of the less formal schools. According to Marjorie Balge, in the January-February 1982  Art & Antiques,  ""Dodge followed her example and began preparing himself for a career in art. He enrolled in the atelier of the successful Salon painter Jean Léon Gérôme."" His early works were large scale and were ""produced specifically for exhibition purposes and done in the historically accurate, carefully finished style promoted by Gérôme. ... In addition, Gérôme consistently advocated working from life; consequently his pupils -- more than those of other French academicians -- studied the human figure meticulously.    ""This solid academic background enabled Dodge to understand the requirements of mural painting as it developed in late 19th-early 20th century America. The technique acquired by American artists in Parisian ateliers was applied to the creation of works based largely on the study of Italian Renaissance masters and the contemporary art of Puvis de Chavannes. Puvis was particularly admired for his ability to think poetically in color on large surfaces with an emphasis on simplicity and abstract design.""    But Puvis's preference for dreamy idealized figures did not always find a following in America. Indeed by 1913, Edwin Blashfield, in his book on  Mural Painting in America,  characterized the stylistic tendency as a striving for ""vigor of presentation"" that involved heavy pigment and broad handling. ""That bold approach to the medium is certainly reflected in the work of William de Leftwich Dodge,"" said the 1982  Art & Antiques.           ""Literature,"" one of four tympanums in the Northwest Pavilion,   is joined by ""Science,"" ""Art"" and ""Music.""          ""Used as a model for later mural projects, the Library of Congress was unparalleled in size, complexity, and decorative splendor,"" the article continued. ""It was indeed our national monument of art, and the paintings by Dodge reinforced that idea. In the shallow, stage-like space of the four lunettes, classical figures represented various aspects of Music, Literature, Art, and Science. Ambition, the subject of the ceiling disc, symbolized the incentive for all human effort, whether in the arts or sciences.""    According to Ms. Balge, ""The eclecticism characteristic of Beaux-Arts training, and by extension the American Renaissance, is present in the divergent stylistic treatment of the two painted zones of the pavilion. In the lunettes ... the harmonious, rather static quality of these compositions is in direct contrast to the energetic illusionism of the ceiling painting. Here the contorted poses and drastic foreshortening of figures that appear to tumble out of the space or recede into the heavens recall works by the Italian masters Mantegna or Tiepolo. Never directly imitative, Dodge, like the rest of the artists employed on these mural projects, felt free to borrow and synthesize stylistic elements of the past in the interest of furthering the dream of American culture and civilization.""    In a letter from Dodge dated March 11, 1896, at his Paris studio to Bernard R. Green, superintendent and engineer for the Library, he states, ""... the ivory and gold, which you have decorated the other three pavilions with, will be quite satisfactory to me and any little thing like a spot of color here and there can be done to suit the paintings when they are in place.    ""The ceiling [mural] is finished and will be in the Salon this year. [Jean Léon] Gérôme and Collin [Louis Joseph Raphael Collin, a French painter] who have seen it were very complimentary. They like it exceedingly. One of the panels I will have done in little over a week, and the three others are far advanced. I have two good men working for me all the time, and I work myself night and day. I will finish them easily before the time given.    ""... I am sure that you and Mr. Casey will like them as all the big men over here do. I am trying my utmost to have them [be] the best in the Library.""       ""Science""             An unidentified American newspaper article (circa 1896) said:    ""At the studio of William Leftwich Dodge we saw some important decorations which he is doing for one of the pavilions of this library. They comprise a ceiling and four panels. The ceiling is completed, and is now being exhibited at the salon of the Champs d'Elysee, and receiving a success that is very flattering to the young painter. The four panels Mr. Dodge is working on now at his studio, and the first one, Music, he was engaged on when he descended from the high scaffolding, clad in a very workmanlike and much-bedaubed blouse, to make us welcome. The huge canvas was stretched across the length of his studio, and he and his assistant were perched in mid-air, laying on their colors from small carefully drawn sketches in front of them.    ""Painters differ somewhat in their method of working, but Mr. Dodge's system of doing his decorations is perhaps the one generally used in this line of art. It would, of course, be extremely difficult, if not impossible to paint the figures in a large decoration directly from the model. Small colored sketches of the composition are first made and the separate figures are then most carefully drawn, perhaps a third lifesize, or a third or fourth the exact size of the figures of the decoration. The large canvas is then commenced, and a large part of the work is purely mechanical and consists of a nice mathematical calculation.    ""... Mr. Dodge is one of the most prominent of the band of young American artists who, while making their home in Paris, have won a measure of success in their own country.    ""... Decoration seems to be a most important feature now and a form of art to which we are giving the most encouragement in America and Mr. Dodge's career in this direction will be watched with interest.""       ""Art""             After completing the Library of Congress murals Dodge married Fanny Pryor and in 1900 moved to New York City where he went on to become one of the country's leading mural painters. His work for many New York City theaters included the Empire, Folies Bergère (now the Helen Hayes), Winter Garden, Lowe's and others. Other buildings that included his decorations were the original Hotel Waldorf Astoria on Fifth Avenue, the Hotel Astor, the Hotel Algonquin, Cafe de l'Opera, Cafe Martin and the Hall of Records of the Surrogate Court of the State of New York, where both oils and mosaics exist. Recently, in Boston, his murals have been restored at the Emerson-Majestic Theatre. In addition, he painted murals for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Flag Room of the New York State Capitol in Albany and the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco (not currently exhibited). He also painted decorations for steamers on the Great Lakes, private residences and many other public buildings in America.       This study (right) was realized in ""Music"" at the bottom of the tympanum, just to the right of center, but in a somewhat different pose.       In 1903 Dodge was commissioned by Louis Comfort Tiffany to paint murals depicting the history of Canada in the King Edward Hotel in Toronto. After completion, Tiffany requested some major changes. Dodge refused because he felt they would alter the integrity of his work. His father-in-law, Roger A. Pryor, represented him in a suit against Tiffany Studios. The court ruled in Dodge's favor, and the case became a landmark in the effort to preserve artists' rights: ""It has been decreed by the Supreme Court [New York] that an artist's work cannot be altered without his consent and at the same time have his name attached to it.""    ""The American success and recognition of Dodge,"" wrote Ms. Balge, ""was based primarily on his reputation as a mural painter, but his talent extended well beyond that. Certainly on the strength of his oils and watercolors alone, Dodge invites comparison with the best of his American and European counterparts.""    An exhibition of Dodge's easel paintings, including landscapes, figurative and marine works, is being planned by the Beacon Hill Fine Art gallery in New York City for the spring of 1998.

The mosaic panels in the                    Library of Congress,  Law  and  History , are mentioned                    in almost all the biographical dictionaries on artists as being                    Dielman's most well-known works. He also created a large mosaic,                     Thrift , in the Albany Savings Bank; six mosaic panels                    in the State Capitol buildings in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and                    Des Moines, Iowa; and, seven mural paintings for the Evening                    Star building in Washington, D. C. (1902, destroyed).                    In 1894, when Dielman received his Library                    of Congress commission for the  Law  and  History                     mosaics, it may have been his first experience to provide large-scale                    designs in this medium for an architectural setting. When Dielman                    set up his first studio in New York in 1876 after four years                    of art study in Munich, he was a figure painter and an illustrator                    of deluxe editions of works by Hawthorne, George Eliot, Longfellow                    and Tennyson. Dielman also painted genre scenes, landscapes                    and portraits, and he was apparently at ease working in various                    media -- pencil, ink, etching, watercolor, oil, and even painting                    on ceramic tile.                                                        top            of page                            Early              Life and Training             Born in Hanover, Germany, on December 25, 1847, Dielman came to Baltimore              as a child and received his formal education at Calvert College in              that city, graduating in 1864. He was a topographer with the United              States Engineers from 1866 to 1872 and participated in a survey of              the canals in the Allegheny Mountains of Virginia. He may have had              a natural artistic talent as it is recorded that he published his              first drawing,  A Confederate Raid in Maryland , at age sixteen.              Dielman returned to Germany in 1872 to receive his formal art training              at the Royal Academy of Munich, where he studied under Wilhelm von              Diez (1839-1907), a genre painter and illustrator known for his historical              depictions of the Thirty Years War. The detailed realism of 17th century              Dutch and Flemish painters appealed to von Diez as did the graphic              work of Schongauer and Dürer. However, von Diez is said to have admired              greatly the bravura brushwork of Frans Hals (1581/85-1666) and Velasquez              (1599-1660), an appreciation he instilled in his students.                                                                                                                 Aqueduct                    of Potomac,  Georgetown, D.C.  ca. 1865                    Drawn from nature by F. Dielman. Color lithograph by E. Sachse                    & Co., Baltimore. Published by C. Bohn, c1865. Prints and                    Photographs Division Reproduction number: LC-USZC4-1967 (color                    film transparency)                                                          The  rigorous academic training Dielman received              is evident in the technical skill of his drawings, etchings and portrait              paintings, but his landscapes and mural studies have a freshness and              freedom of brushwork that is very modern. The colors are in a higher              key typical of artists of his generation who were very much aware              of the impressionist style that emerged in Paris in the 1870s and              1880s. Many artists who had received their training in Munich or Paris              were Dielman's friends and colleagues in the Tenth Street Studio Building              at 51 West 10th Street in New York where Dielman maintained a studio              from 1881 to 1888 and again from 1900 to 1906. The previous generation              of artists who occupied studios in this building were principally              landscapists of the Hudson River School, the most famous of whom was              Frederick Church (1826-1900) who maintained a studio there from 1858              to 1889, but the Studio Building was infused with new life and vigor              by William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) whose flamboyant personality              and influential style dominated studio life there during his long              tenure from 1878 to 1895.              Frederick Dielman, Chase, and most of the other artists in the Tenth              Street Studio, were members of the National Academy of Design in New              York, Dielman having been elected an associate in 1881 and a full              academician in 1883. Many art clubs and organizations were initiated              by artists in the Studio Building and Dielman was not only a member              of many of these organizations but held administrative positions in              them as well. Dielman was a founding member of the Society of American              Artists in 1877, and was a member of the National Institute of Arts              and Letters, the American Water-color Society, the Salamagundi Sketch              Club, the Etching Club, the Mural Painters, and the Tile Club. He              was President of the National Academy of Design from 1899 to 1909              and President of the Fine Arts Federation of New York from 1910 to              1915. A much loved professor of art, Dielman taught at the Arts Students              League of New York from 1878 to 1886, 1897 to 1898, and 1899 to 1903.              He then taught descriptive geometry and drawing at the College of              the City of New York from 1903 to 1918. Dielman was also the Director              of the Art Schools of the Cooper Union in New York from 1905 to 1931,              though he began lecturing there in the Women's Art School in 1895.              The Cooper Union had an annual enrollment of 2000 students and Dielman              taught both the day and evening classes, retiring only at the venerable              age of 84. It is believed that he taught more American art students              than any other art professor and a testimonial from one of his former              students leaves no doubt that he was revered.                        top            of page                          The              Tile Club                                                                                                                                                             Frederick Dielman                          (1847-1935)                           Portrait of the Terrapin                          [Self-Portrait] 1886  Drawing                             Reproduced in  A Book of the Tile Club , Boston:                          Houghton Mifflin & Co., 1886, p. 71                          Rare Book and Special Collections Division                                                                                                                                   Frederick Dielman                          (1847-1935)                           On a Tile Club Trip,                          with Edwin Austin Abbey                          and F.D.

In 1877, at the behest of a British                  architect, Edward Wimbridge, who suggested painting on 8 x 8 inch                  ceramic tiles, a group of twelve artists and writers joined together                  more for the fellowship, exchange of ideas, and conviviality of                  like-minded souls as the media in which the artists actually worked                  was not limited to tile work. The club existed until about 1887                  and its original members included the illustrator, Edwin Abbey,                  and the painters, J. Alden Weir and Winslow Homer. Eventually,                  about 30 men joined the Tile Club but the core group usually remained                  at about 12 members, each member having a nickname. Dielman, the                  Terrapin, was a member by at least June of 1879 when he and other                  members went on a three-week canal-barge expedition along the                  Hudson River via the Northern Canal to Lake Champlain, scenes                  of which Dielman sketched and painted. Later members included                  the architect, Stanford White; the sculptor, Augustus Saint Gaudens;                  the painters, William Merritt Chase, John Twachtman, Elihu Vedder,                  F. D. Millet, the painter and photographer, Napoleon Sarony, and                  the Japanese art director, Heromichi Shugio. There were even four                  honorary musician members. The Tilers met on Wednesdays, usually                  near the Tenth Street Studio Building, where they critiqued each                  other's work. They also had dinner parties in each other's studios                  with musical accompaniment from their honorary members, went on                  sketching excursions to the seaside and countryside, or visited                  art museums. A collegial group, the artists and writers collaborated                  on writing and illustrating their own Tile Club publications as                  well as on articles published in  Harper's Weekly ,  Scribner's                   or  Century  magazines. Their final publication was A                  Book of the Tile Club in 1886 which describes the easy camaraderie                  of the Tile Club and includes anecdotes about Dielman and other                  members.                                                           top            of page                          Late              Life                                            In  1883, Frederick                  Dielman married Lilla Marion Benham, the daughter of Major General                  Henry Washington Benham, U. S. Engineers, a graduate of West Point                  in 1837. Today, Dielman's portrait of his father-in-law is in                  the United States Military Academy, West Point Museum. Three children                  were born to Dielman and his wife, one of whom became a painter                  and sculptor, Ernest Benham Dielman. When Frederick Dielman died                  at age 87 on August 15, 1935, at his home in Ridgefield, Connecticut,                  he was the oldest member of the National Academy of Design. Though                  Dielman lived in Connecticut for 35 years and maintained a studio                  in New York for 50 years, he was buried in New Windsor, Maryland,                  northwest of Baltimore.

Shortly after Dielman's death, he              was described by one of his former students: ""When Professor Dielman              lectured to us he was already well over 60. But he had a buoyancy              of spirit and a twinkle in his eye which belied his years . . . .              The lectures were absorbingly interesting and sank deeply into our              consciousness. The appreciation he gave us for the artistic heritage              of the ages has, in consequence, remained with us, and has helped              to make life richer for those fortunate enough to have been his  pupils ."" 5               At age 85 in 1933, when Dielman was asked in a personal interview              ""what he considered the best recipe for a happy, well-rounded life,              the artist said: 'I think if a man tries to ascertain what is his              probable function in life and then carries it out honestly, sincerely              and with as little pretense as possible, he is pretty sure to come              out  right .'"" 6                                                                                    top            of page           previous page           next page                                         Home               |  The Commission  |  The              Inspiration  |  The Artist  |               Further Reading                                                               Law              Library of Congress              Comments:  law@loc.gov  (03/13/00)                                                            Library            of Congress"

When the Rotunda of the National Archives Building reopens in September, visitors will once again be able to view the original Charters of Freedom. As they enter the hall, they will see, as visitors have for 65 years, the two large-scale murals that depict fictional scenes of the presentation of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But the paintings will have a new look—no longer tired and dingy, they have been painstakingly cleaned and conserved.   In the decades after Barry Faulkner created these murals in 1936, they had noticeably deteriorated. The plaster behind the canvases had crumbled in places, causing buckles and bulges. Some paint layers had separated. Dust and detritus that accumulated over the decades had caused the images to become dingy. Even though some surface cleaning had taken place in 1970, they needed full conservation treatment.   As part of the overall  renovation of the National Archives Building , the Rotunda was closed July 5, 2001, until September 17, 2003, thus allowing time for the murals to be removed, conserved, and reinstalled in a thorough, deliberate manner.   Several donors have made the murals project possible. The effort was supported in part by a grant from Save America's Treasures through a partnership between the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. Gifts also came from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Bay Foundation. The conservation of the Rotunda murals was designated an official Save America's Treasures project in 1999.   Atlantic Company of America, Inc., was general contractor for Olin Conservation, Inc., which planned and performed the heroic task of removing the massive murals, transporting them to a specially constructed conservation lab, restoring the artwork, and reinstalling them.   Under the direction of senior conservator David Olin, the conservation team began its work in November 2000. UBS, Inc. (a scaffolding contractor), erected a special curved scaffold in the Rotunda. The mural surfaces underwent preliminary cleaning to remove dust and grime. Tissue paper was adhered to the painted surface to protect the paint in preparation for removing the murals off the curved walls.   Because the murals had been affixed to the walls with a lead adhesive, the removal process had to follow stringent lead-abatement procedures. After softening the adhesive layers, the murals could be painstakingly separated from the wall. Only moderate amounts of plaster and excess lead adhesive remained affixed to the back of the canvas. The paintings were gradually rolled onto enormous aluminum spools as they came off the walls, then transferred from the metal spools to very large and sturdy cardboard tubes.   In December 2001, a team of movers carried the rolled murals out the back door of the Rotunda, down the marble staircase to the Pennsylvania Avenue lobby, and out the door to a waiting truck that whisked them to the conservation laboratory where they remained until November 2002, when the studio conservation work was complete.   While in the lab, remnants of plaster and adhesive were removed, and the murals were flattened. The paintings were infused with a synthetic wax resin to stabilize the aged canvas and the underlying paint. Then the tissue paper on the painted surface, the paste from the tissue paper, the layers of grime, and varnish were removed with meticulous care. Next, the murals were expertly cleaned to remove discolored varnish and coatings.   In December 2002, the murals were reinstalled onto aluminum panels newly affixed to the Rotunda walls. The panels cannot be seen, but they will make it easier to remove the murals again whenever they require conservation. After final varnishing, in-painting was done in small areas where paint had flaked off. A temporary barrier was placed over the murals in January 2003 to protect them as the Rotunda renovation proceeded.   When the Rotunda reopens in September, the murals will be seen in all their glory in the light of a new fiber-optic system designed and installed by BAND, Inc. (a lighting contractor). Barry Faulkner would be pleased.       May & June 2003 Calendar of Events
