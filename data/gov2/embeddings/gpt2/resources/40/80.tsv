Bush      Federal funding of research using existing embryonic stem cell lines is consistent with the President's belief in the fundamental value and sanctity of human life.   The President's decision reflects his fundamental commitment to preserving the value and sanctity of human life and his desire to promote vital medical research. The President's decision will permit federal funding of research using the more than 60 existing stem cell lines that have already been derived, but will not sanction or encourage the destruction of additional human embryos. The embryos from which the existing stem cell lines were created have already been destroyed and no longer have the possibility of further development as human beings.  Federal funding of medical research on these existing stem cell lines will promote the sanctity of life "" without undermining it "" and will allow scientists to explore the potential of this research to benefit the lives of millions of people who suffer from life destroying diseases.     Federal funds will only be used for research on existing stem cell lines that were derived: (1) with the informed consent of the donors; (2) from excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes; and (3) without any financial inducements to the donors.  In order to ensure that federal funds are used to support only stem cell research that is scientifically sound, legal, and ethical, the NIH will examine the derivation of all existing stem cell lines and create a registry of those lines that satisfy this criteria.  More than 60 existing stem cell lines from genetically diverse populations around the world are expected to be available for federally-funded research.     No federal funds will be used for: (1) the derivation or use of stem cell lines derived from newly destroyed embryos; (2) the creation of any human embryos for research purposes; or (3) the cloning of human embryos for any purpose.  Today's decision relates only to the use of federal funds for research on existing stem cell lines derived in accordance with the criteria set forth above.     The President will create a new President's Council on Bioethics, chaired by Dr. Leon Kass, an expert in biomedical ethics and a professor at the University of Chicago, to study the human and moral ramifications of developments in biomedical and behaviorial science and technology.  The Council will study such issues as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, genetic screening, gene therapy, euthanasia, psychoactive drugs, and brain implants.     BACKGROUND    Embryonic stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells, which come from the inner cell mass of a human embryo, have the potential to develop into all or nearly all of the tissues in the body.  The scientific term for this characteristic is ""pluripotentiality.""    Adult stem cells.  Adult stem cells are unspecialized, can renew themselves, and can become specialized to yield all of the cell types of the tissue from which they originate.  Although scientists believe that some adult stem cells from one tissue can develop into cells of another tissue, no adult stem cell has been shown in culture to be pluripotent.    The potential of embryonic stem cell research.  Many scientists believe that embryonic stem cell research may eventually lead to therapies that could be used to treat diseases that afflict approximately 128 million Americans.  Treatments may include replacing destroyed dopamine-secreting neurons in a Parkinson's patient's brain; transplanting insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic patients; and infusing cardiac muscle cells in a heart damaged by myocardial infarction.  Embryonic stem cells may also be used to understand basic biology and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new medicines.    The creation of embryonic stem cells.  To create embryonic stem cells for research, a ""stem cell line"" must be created from the inner cell mass of a week-old embryo.  If they are cultured properly, embryonic stem cells can grow and divide indefinitely.  A stem cell line is a mass of cells descended from the original, sharing its genetic characteristics.  Batches of cells can then be separated from the cell line and distributed to researchers.    The origin of embryonic stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells are derived from excess embryos created in the course of infertility treatment.  As a result of standard in vitro fertilization practices, many excess human embryos are created.  Participants in IVF treatment must ultimately decide the disposition of these excess embryos, and many individuals have donated their excess embryos for research purposes.    Existing stem cell lines. There are currently more than 60 existing different human embryonic stem cell lines that have been developed from excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization with the consent of the donors and without financial inducement.  These existing lines are used in approximately one dozen laboratories around the world (in the United States, Australia, India, Israel, and Sweden).      Therapies from adult and embryonic stem cell research.  To date, adult stem cell research, which is federally-funded, has resulted in the development of a variety of therapeutic treatments for diseases.  Although embryonic stem cell research has not yet produced similar results, many scientists believe embryonic stem cell research holds  promise over time because of the capacity of embryonic stem cells to develop into any tissue in the human body.

GX269-97-3870459	"Vol. 56, No. 16  August 5, 1996  Dengue Fever Dengue was endemic in parts of the United States, including Texas, until 1945, when improved sanitation and the use of pesticides dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease. Only sporadic, travel-related dengue cases were reported through 1979, but outbreaks with some indigenous transmission occurred in 1980 and 1986.1,2 Indigenous cases were again reported, from Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, in 1995. Understandably, interest in dengue is once again high. The first section of this report is a brief retrospective of dengue's history, characteristics, and current status in this hemisphere. The following section contains Texas morbidity and mortality data for 1995.  Dengue Retrospective Among the newly emergent and re-emergent diseases in the Western Hemisphere is dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease characterized by high fever, headache, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash. There are four virus serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN4, all of which are transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and possibly by Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Both species lay their eggs in open containers of water. Due in part to the disappearance of mosquito eradication programs, dengue has once again swept Latin America and now threatens the US. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 274,922 cases of dengue and 7,715 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with 104 deaths, occurred in the Americas in 1995.3 In response to the current situation, PAHO has drafted an emergency action plan, focusing on education of at-risk populations, international cooperation in surveillance, and reactivation of vector control programs.  word derives from the Swahili description of the disease: ki denga pepo, meaning ""cramplike seizure caused by an evil spirit.""5 Outbreaks widely affected Texas residents during every decade from 1885 to 1941, primarily due to the rapid expansion of the shipping industry.6 Ships transported infected mosquitoes and people to unaffected areas, leading to pandemics of dengue in the western hemisphere as early as 1827 and every 20 or 30 years for the rest of the century. As commercial ports in Texas flourished, the disease was imported along with more desirable cargo into Galveston, Brownsville, and Houston, often reaching as far inland as Austin. In the late 1800s, the diagnosis of dengue was still confusing; some practitioners considered it to be a form of yellow fever. Doctors earned their patients' ire by, ""charging them two yellow fever bills, whilst contending that the disease attacks but once.""7 Yellow fever was not the only source of confusion in diagnosis. Throughout the 19th century arthritic symptoms were associated with what was then called dengue. In hindsight, this situation Continued F  A Brief Stateside History of Dengue Nearly two centuries ago Benjamin Rush, a doctor in Philadelphia, wrote what may have been the first clinical report of dengue. Describing an epidemic that occurred in Philadelphia in 1789, he called the illness ""breakbone fever.""4 During a West Indies epidemic 30 years later, the word dengue was coined to describe the symptoms outlined by Rush. This  Also in this issue: A Pot of Shigella at Rainbow's End Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area Perspectives in Public Health Conference Conference Registration Form   Page 2  August 5, 1996  DPN  suggests that an agent other than dengue was at work. Until the laboratory isolation of the etiologic agent itself, practitioners had to rely on clinical findings to define these and other illnesses easily mistaken for dengue (eg, typhus, rubella, and measles). By the close of the century, healthcare providers in Texas began to realize that textbook descriptions of dengue did not correspond to the disease as it appeared in this state.6 By 1906 dengue had been well defined clinically, and T. L. Bancroft had shown the etiologic agent to be an ultramicroscopic organism transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.5 He conducted his experiments using human subjects. Bancroft's discovery is particularly interesting in light of the fact that the dengue virus was not isolated in the laboratory for another 40 years. In 1922 an epidemic of enormous proportions--one million people are estimated to have been affected--began in Galveston and spread as far as Georgia.8 Although the initial cases were most likely imported, the majority of subsequent cases were locally acquired. The mosquitoes that year had bred in unprecedented proportions, and no eradication efforts had been made. According to a clinical report of the Galveston outbreak, Unscreened houses of the poorer classes, situated near or around the dumping grounds, swarmed with these mosquitoes. They gained entrance to practically all screened houses, invaded automobiles, and countless numbers were present in the grass of overgrown gutters and lawns. The dumping grounds mentioned were swamps used as a garbage dump by the citizens. Many observations of the incubation period were made during this time, increasing knowledge of the disease. Diagnosis in 1922 was based on signs still used today: sudden onset, fever, headache, body aches, and rash.  Outbreaks also occurred in Texas in 1934 and 1941. As was likely during antecedent outbreaks, the virus was probably imported from the Caribbean. The subsequent decline in endemic cases resulted from improved sanitation in the US and from Ae. aegypti eradication programs initiated by PAHO in 1947.9 By 1962 the mosquito was believed to be confined to a few relatively small areas, which included parts of the US, the coasts of Mexico, all of Colombia, and northern Argentina. Ten years later, due to waning interest and political unrest, almost all programs had been discontinued. Today the range of Ae. aegypti includes most of Central and South America, Mexico, and the Southeastern United States (including Texas). (See Figure 1.) Ae. albopictus is another mosquito considered to be a dengue vector. Introduced into the Americas by 1985, probably in tires shipped from Asia, this vector has since spread. It can be found throughout the eastern two-thirds of Texas.10  Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever In 1954 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which had been frequently described but was still unnamed, appeared in the Philippines. Since then, DHF has emerged as a deadly and epidemic problem in the Americas and Asia.11 DHF is characterized by high fever, like classic dengue, but has more serious complications: hemorrhagic phenomena, pain, and circulatory failure. Easy bruising, fine petechiae, epistaxis, and mild gastrointestinal bleeding are, in decreasing order of frequency, DHF symptoms caused by increased capillary permeability. The fatality rate for DHF is about 5% in most countries. One third of DHF cases progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a short (12 to 24 hour) stage of illness that may lead to widely disseminated hemorrhage and coma. The case-fatality rate for untreated DSS is 20%. Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 3  Figure 1. Distribution of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes: North and South America, 1970 and 1995 1970 1990  Shaded areas show large mosquito populations.  The risk of developing DHF is 100 times greater with a second heterotypical infection.9 Although the precise mechanisms affecting the development of DHF are not fully understood, the second infection is thought to trigger an immunopathologic process involving non-neutralizing antibodies from the previous infection.  spread of dengue, also imply that greater efforts should be made to educate practitioners in the diagnosis and control of dengue, especially in high risk areas. In addition, PAHO recommends mosquito surveillance, evaluation of vector control programs, and development of public education programs.9 Education programs must include basic information about the breeding habits of mosquitoes and the necessity for community efforts in removing breeding containers such as aluminum cans, buckets, and used tires from areas of human habitation. According to PAHO, dengue is ""basically a problem of domestic sanitation.""9 The community, therefore, holds the key to the control of mosquitoes, and community efforts determine whether control programs succeed or fail. Prepared by Greg Brown, Student Intern, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Surveillance Division  The Current Situation DEN -2, -1, and -4 have spread, in that order, throughout Latin America after having vanished almost completely during the mosquito eradication programs of the 1950s and 1960s. DEN-3 was introduced to the Americas recently and is spreading,12 bringing with it an increased incidence of both DHF and DSS. A 1980 study found that there was a median of 40 days between the onset of dengue and the diagnosis of disease, suggesting the need for earlier diagnosis of dengue infection and implementation of active surveillance systems.1 These findings, combined with the rapid  Continued F   Page 4 References  August 5, 1996  DPN  TDH was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa....

The proximity of these outbreaks and the fact that the mosquito species that transmit dengue are commonly found in the eastern two-thirds of the state, increased the likelihood of both imported and autochthonous cases occurring in Texas. Therefore, TDH immediately implemented an educational campaign that stressed prevention and an active surveillance system to monitor the situation. (See DPN Vol. 55, Nos. 15 and 21 and Vol. 56, No.1) TDH reported 29 cases of dengue in 1995: 9 from Hidalgo County, 5 from Harris County, 4 from Cameron County, 4 from Dallas County, 2 from Fort Bend County, and 1 each from Bell, Collin, Hays, Tarrant, and Waller Counties. Dengue virus was isolated from 3 patients. The first isolate, from a patient residing in Hidalgo County, was DEN-2; the second, from a patient in Cameron County, was DEN-4; and the third, from a Dallas resident, was DEN-3. Neither the patient with DEN-2 nor the patient with DEN-4 had a travel history. Four cases from Hidalgo County and 3 from Cameron County were locally acquired. The remaining 22 patients had travel histories. Twelve persons had been to Mexico. The others had been to the Caribbean (4), El Salvador (2), Honduras (2), or Guatemala (1), areas where dengue was epidemic. The patient with DEN-3 drove through Mexico and Guatemala to El Salvador. Two patients had onset of illness in March, 2 in July, 5 in August, 9 in September, 7 in October, 2 in November, and 2 in December. Symptoms included fever (29 patients), arthralgias/bone pain (26), headache (24), chills (21), myalgias (18), anorexia (18), severe malaise (17), rash (16), lumbosacral pain (12), nausea/ vomiting (12), dysgeusia (11), retro-orbital pain (9), dysesthesia (7), respiratory symptoms (7), petechiae, purpura, or epistaxis (3), and lymphadenopathy (4).  Dengue in Texas: 1995 On August 25, 1995, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, approximately 10 miles from McAllen, Texas. By the end of December, 2,361 cases were reported. An additional 430 cases of dengue were reported from  Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 5  People can eliminate dengue vector breeding sites by removing, emptying, or covering containers of water. Therefore, health officials in Mexico and Texas are attempting to avert an outbreak in 1996 through public health education campaigns. In May bilingual pamphlets, Prevent Dengue by Stopping the Mosquito Life Cycle, were distributed to children attending public schools in South Texas. In addition, a slide presentation detailing the epidemiology of dengue will soon be available through TDH regional offices and the TDH film library. Since most dengue cases occur from August through December, the 1996 season is imminent. Healthcare workers should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have symptoms similar to those of dengue, particularly u u  when they also have a history of recent travel to areas associated with risk. The TDH Laboratory performs viral isolation and serologic tests. Whole blood, serum, or CSF (collected within 5 days of onset) should be placed on dry ice and shipped overnight for viral isolation. Single serum specimens may be submitted at ambient temperature for antibody detection. Convalescent sera (collected 10 to 14 days after the acute specimen was drawn) may be required to confirm recent infection. Send specimens to Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Laboratories, 1100 West 49th Street, Austin, Texas 78756.

The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States and at least 2 other countries. The Rainbow Gathering in Missouri this year is the second to be associated with a shigella outbreak. Of approximately 12,000 persons who attended the gathering held in North Carolina, July 1987, an estimated 1,200 became ill with shigella. The first S.sonnei case was culture confirmed on July 8. As of July 26, the Missouri Public Health Laboratory (MPHL) had confirmed 21 cases, with additional suspected cases still under investigation. The organism is resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The home residences of these 21 case-patients are as follows: Missouri (3); California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, and Oregon (2 each); Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Tennessee (1 each); and Germany (1). The standard treatment protocol being used at this time is ciprofloxacin, 500 mg, twice a day for 3 days (for a total of 6 doses). Of the estimated 500 Rainbow Gathering participants who remain, 30%40% are reportedly ill. As of July 26, 2 giardia cases also have been confirmed. (One of the giardia cases was in an individual who also had culture-confirmed S. sonnei). The MDH investigation and laboratory testing is still in progress. Self-described as a ""disorganization of nonmembers,"" the Rainbow Family has gathered on public land in different locations every year since July 4, 1972. For the week-long festival, participants refuse to sign permits, citing their First Amendment right to assemble peaceably. Organizers began setting up camp in Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest on June 12. Participants camped in the forest and ate communally. Drinking water was obtained from nearby springs and creeks that were also used for bathing. Continued F  The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States ....   Page 6  August 5, 1996  DPN  In light of health problems connected with previous Rainbow Gatherings, the large number of participants at this event, and their nonstandard approach to public hygiene, MDH initiated the following control measures. Active surveillance was begun at local hospitals on June 23, hospital staff were asked to report all health conditions treated in Rainbow Family members, and laboratory testing was included in evaluation of diarrheal cases.  S. sonnei infection causes an acute diarrheal disease that often lasts only 1 to 3 days; many individuals do not seek medical care for this type of illness. When they do, many are treated empirically, and stool cultures are not obtained. Because a large number of people from all over the US and 2 other countries attended the Rainbow Gathering in Missouri last month, and because the S. sonnei strain responsible for this outbreak is multidrug resistant--TDH recommends that physicians obtain stool specimens from patients with diarrheal illness. Cases possibly associated with the Missouri outbreak should be reported by calling (800) 252-8239. All other shigella cases should be reported to the local health authority by calling the statewide number, (800) 705-8868.  Shigella in Texas S. sonnei accounted for 1,555 (52%) of the 3,017 shigella cases reported in Texas in 1995. Texas law requires that shigellosis be reported to the Texas Department of Health on a weekly basis. For a variety of reasons, however, many S. sonnei cases probably are not reported.  Note: As of August 1, 1996, cryptosporidium infections and ehrlichiosis were added to the list of reportable diseases. In addition TDH has limited the reporting of invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections to H. influenzae type b infections only.  Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area As of July 26, 1996, investigation continues of a measles outbreak that began in Harris County; 1 case has also been confirmed in Liberty County. Rash onset for the first culture-confirmed case was May 9, and for the most recent case was July 22. The clinical case definition of measles is as follows: generalized rash lasting 3 or more days PLUS temperature of 101F or higher PLUS cough or coryza or conjunctivitis. The rash usually breaks out on the face and spreads to the chest, arms, and legs. To date, 16 cases have been confirmed. Of the 16 case-patients, 9 were children 7 to 9 years of age, 1 was 13 years old, and 6 were younger than 4 years of age. Seven case-patients had received 1 dose of measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two boys, brothers 8 and 9 years of age, were unvaccinated due to invalid contraindications. An additional 5 patients, aged 9 to 18 months were also unvaccinated. Two of these patients were below the minimum age for MMR. TDH recommends that infants 6 to 11 months of age residing in the Harris County area be vaccinated with the single-antigen measles vaccine, if available. If not, MMR may be given. Children aged 1 to 4 years should have 1 dose (preferably 2) of MMR vaccine. Persons in other areas of the state should follow TDH standard recommendations: a first dose of MMR at 12 months of age and a second dose at 4 years of age. All persons 4 years of age or older born on or after January 1, 1957 should have at least 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine, preferably 2 doses of MMR. Report all suspected cases of measles IMMEDIATELY by calling (800) 252-9152.  It takes 2 doses of measles vaccine to assure protection against measles.   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 7  Perspectives in Public Health: Texas Department of Health (TDH) Quarterly CME Conference On September 20, 1996, from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) will present its Perspectives in Public Health: TDH Quarterly CME Conference.

It occurred in two forms: variola major, which killed 20% or         more of its victims, and variola minor, which killed 1%. (1) In its         typically widespread epidemics, one percent was often rendered in the         thousands.    Smallpox began         somewhat like the flu, with chills, high fever, nausea, and aches.         Within a few days, however, its characteristic rash of unsightly,         painfully swollen pustules declared itself. The disease spread with         devastating ease from one individual to another by way of droplets from         the nose and mouth (for example, in sneezing), contact with the dried         scabs of the pustules, or even contact with clothing or articles used by         people with smallpox. It took about 12 days from exposure to the time         the disease became evident; consequently, care givers of people with         smallpox often caught the disease and then followed the first wave of         victims to the grave within a matter of weeks                               The numbers of people killed by smallpox in previous         centuries are so large that they are numbing. Some authors credit         smallpox with the collapse of both the Aztec and Incan empires, (2)         civilizations that had prospered for centuries in South America, Mexico,         and nearly halfway into the North American continent.            Some historians think smallpox emerged when humans first began to         grow their own food, around 12,000 years ago.  (3)  From that         time forward, every human era was marked by the presence of smallpox.         Anthropologists have determined that eruptions evident on the skin of an         Egyptian mummy of the 20th dynasty (1200-1100 B.C.) originated in         smallpox. (4) From the earliest days of Europe, epidemics hung like a         perpetual thundercloud over human society. As Thomas Babington Macaulay,         a 19th-century British historian and statesman, (5) observed, ""The         havoc of the [bubonic, or ""black""] plague had been far more         rapid: but plague had visited our shores only once or twice within         living memory; and the smallpox was always present....""(6) In 1519,         the Spanish brought the disease to Mexico, where three and a half         million Indians died. (7) In the 17th and 18th century, entire tribes in         North America were wiped out by smallpox. (8) In the North American         colonies, those who could, would flee to the countryside when the first         case in a new epidemic appeared. (9) Epidemics often followed the course         of a river or trails taken by traders and explorers. Many people who         survived this highly contagious disease bore its mark forever in         unsightly scars, and many were left blind. However, survivors truly         triumphed, because having the disease and surviving it made them immune         to having it again. Recognizing a similar, crossover effect in milkmaids         who contracted cowpox--they appeared to be immune to smallpox--Dr.         Edward Jenner began late 17th- and early 18th-century efforts to rid         humanity of this scourge.           On May 14, 1796, Dr. Jenner performed an experiment that         demonstrates how desperate people were to find some way to prevent this         terrible scourge. He inoculated (vaccinated) a boy with matter taken         from pustular cowpox lesions. Several weeks later, he challenged the         success of the first inoculation by vaccinating the boy with smallpox.         It was a tremendous risk, but it worked. The boy didn't develop         smallpox. . Following publication of the results in June 1798, Jenner         predicted the eventual eradication of smallpox. It took more than two         centuries to prove him correct.           Jenner was hardly the first to observe that inoculation could         prevent disease. Folk methods had been tried in many cultures, most of         them relying herbs, magic, religious objects, prayers, incantations, and         ultimately, luck. In some countries where more than one God was         worshiped, there were gods to whom one prayed specifically for         protection against smallpox.  (11)  Medical practitioners in a         number of ancient cultures had made observations about resistance to         smallpox and had experimented with methods of immunization. Around 1700,         nearly a century before Dr. Jenner's experiment, the practice of         variolation--inoculation of a healthy person with pus from an infected         person's smallpox lesions--was first tried in England, but the practice         is believed to have originated in Africa and was learned from slaves.         (12) In 1716, Cotton Mather, a member of the clergy, author, scholar,         and physician in Boston, (13) sent Dr. John Woodward, an English         physician, a vivid description of inoculation, as it had been described         to him by one of his slaves, Anesimus. (14) The difference between the         African method and Jenner's method was that Jenner involved a third         party (cows) and a milder form of the disease (cowpox). His work opened         the door to immunization as we know it today.

Through         massive vaccination efforts, smallpox has been wiped out. This historic         victory occurred in this century, in the lifetimes of today's         grandparents, parents, and children.           The one weakness of the variola (smallpox) virus is that it         survives by being passed from one person to another. Public health         officials worldwide joined together in the 1970s to take advantage of         this weakness. They undertook to interrupt the cycle of smallpox through         an intensive immunization and monitoring effort. In effect, by         immunizing humans, they were removing the human incubator from the         cycle, one vaccination at a time.           This was a huge task, involving many densely populated         countries with limited health, technology, and communications         facilities. Nevertheless, the effort succeeded. The last case of variola         major occurred on Bhola Island in Bangladesh in October, 1975. The last         case of variola minor was in Ethiopia in August, 1976. Although smallpox         had been a nearly constant companion for twelve millennia, no one         grieved over its quiet departure.           Because smallpox has been eradicated, smallpox vaccination         has ceased everywhere. Travelers no longer need certificates to prove         vaccination against this disease. (15) The children born at the end of         this century may be puzzled by the small, round scars on their parents'         and grandparents' upper left arms, the last scars left by smallpox.

GX233-37-11579423	"History of Tuberculosis       TB has a lineage that can be traced to the earliest history of mankind.       The tubercle bacillus, the organism that causes TB disease, can be traced as far     back as 5000 BC when archeologists found evidence in human bones of the existence in human     bones of the existence of TB.  Evidence was found in ancient Egyptian mummies which     showed deformities consistent with TB disease.         Evidence of TB appears in Biblical scripture, in Chinese literature dating     back to around 4000 BC, and in religious books in India around 2000 BC.  In ancient     Greece Hippocrates mentions TB around 400 BC. as does Aristotle, who talked about     ""phthisis and its cure""(ca. 350 BC).       It was thought that Columbus brought TB to the new world in 1492, but     evidence was found in 1994, when scientists reported that they had identified TB bacterium     DNA in the mummified remains of a woman who died in the Americas 500 years before Columbus     set sail for the New World.       The ""Great White Plague"" which started in Europe in the 1600's     and continued for 200 years was Tuberculosis.  Other names through out history for     tuberculosis are Phthisis(from the Greek word to waste away), scrofula(swellings of the     lymph nodes of the neck), consumption(progressive wasting away of the body), and TB(the     presence or products of the tubercle bacillus).       In 1720, in his publication,  A New Theory of Consumption,  the     English physician Benjamin Marten was the first to conjecture that TB could be caused by     ""wonderfully minute living creatures,"" which, once they had gained a foothold in     the body, could generate the lesions and symptoms of the disease.  He continued that     ""It may be therefore very likely that by an habitual lying in the same bed with a     consumptive patient, constantly eating and drinking with him, or by very frequently     conversing so nearly as to draw in part of the breath he emits from the Lungs, a     consumption may be caught by a sound person.  I imagine that slightly conversing with     consumptive patients is seldom or never sufficient to catch the disease.""  For a     physician living in such an early era, Dr. Marten showed much medical insight.       In 1882, at a time when TB was raging through Europe and the Americas,     killing one in seven people, a German biologist by the name of Robert Koch presented to     the scientific community his discovery of the organism that caused TB.  It was called     a tubercle bacillus because small rounded bodies (tubercles) occurred in the diseased     tissue and where characteristic of the disease.  Through his many experiments with     the organism, Dr. Koch worked on developing a cure for TB.  Koch was able to isolate     a protein from the tubercle bacillus that he tried as an immunizing agent and later as a     treatment for TB; in both cases it failed.  However, the substance called ""old     tuberculin,"" was to be later used as the screening tool (tuberculin skin tests) for     identifying people and animals infected with tubercle bacilli.       A further significant advance came in 1895 when Wilhelm Konrad von     Roentgen discovered the radiation (x-rays) that bears his name.  This allowed the     progress and severity of a patient's disease to be accurately followed and reviewed.       TB in America during the colonial period was accepted as a scourge of     humanity that was common to the poor and rich alike.  The first available mortality     figures from Massachusetts in 1796 indicated 300 deaths per 100,000 population.  The     peak mortality figure reached in New England was 1,600 per 100,000 in 1800.  With the     industrial development, the epidemic traveled to the Midwest in 1840 and to the West in     1880.  The American Indians and Alaskans were the last American populations to become     effected by the TB epidemic.  At the turn of the century it was estimated that 10% of     all deaths in the United States were due to TB.       In 1886, Edward Livingston Trudeau a physician who recovered from TB,     started the sanatorium movement in the United States at Saranac Lake, New York.  He     based it on the European model of strict supervision in providing fresh air and sunshine,     bed rest, and nutritious foods.  As infection control measures took hold in large     urban centers of the country, TB patients who could not be treated in local dispensaries     were removed from the general population and place into sanatoriums.   By 1938     there were more than 700 sanatoriums throughout the U.S., yet the number of patients     outnumbered the beds available.       In 1892, Dr. Herman Biggs of New York started mandatory reporting of TB     cases.  He thought that we should:               educate the public of the dangers that the disease posed to the person         and his/her contacts.                 properly dispose of and immediately destroy sputum or the         ""discharges from the lungs"" of the individuals with disease.                 Have all physicians of pulmonary cases report such cases to the health         department.                 Have health inspectors visit the families where TB exists and deliver         proper literature and take specific measures to disinfect the areas as may be required.                 Obtain and submit sputum specimens to the laboratory for analysis                 Create a consumptive hospital to care for indigent patients.                     The board adopted most of the recommendations made by Biggs, including the     creation of the Consumptive Hospital.  These recommendations created a storm of     controversy among the medical community.  Many private doctors objected to the     mandatory reporting, believing that it violated physician-patient confidentiality.       Because of the resistance from the medical community, reporting practices were not fully     implemented for several years.  In the end, Biggs' recommendations to the Board and     their implementation in New York City created the model for TB control programs that was     emulated by other health departments across the country and laid the groundwork for a     campaign called the ""War on Consumption.""       In 1904 a voluntary health agency was organized under the National     Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, later renamed the National     Tuberculosis Association (NTA) and now known as the American Lung Association.       On November 20, 1944, the antibiotic ""Streptomycin"" was     administered for the first time to an critically ill TB patient. The effect was almost     immediate and impressive.  His advanced disease was visibly arrested, the bacteria     disappeared from his sputum, and he made a rapid recovery.  The new drug had side     effects - especially on the inner ear - but the fact remained,  M. Tuberculosis      was no longer a bacteriological exception; it could be assailed and beaten into retreat     within the human body.       A rapid succession of anti-TB drugs appeared in the following years.       These were important because with streptomycin monotherapy, resistant mutants began     to appear within a few months, endangering the success of antibiotic therapy.       However, it was soon demonstrated that this problem could be overcome with the combination     of two or three drugs.       Turning the Page on a New Century               Each year there are 2 million TB-related deaths worldwide.                 One person dies from TB every 10 seconds                 An estimated 2 billion people are infected with TB                 8 million people around the world become sick with TB each year.

GX260-99-12733719	"APPENDIX C:  HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS  METHODS FOR GROWING HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS IN VITRO To grow cultures of human ES cells, Thomson and his collaborators used 36 fresh or frozen embr yos generated in IVF laboratories from couples undergoing treatment for infertility. From the 14 embr yos that developed to the blastocyst stage, they established 5 human ES cell lines--H1, H7, H9, H13 and H14 [35]. Four of the 5 lines were derived from frozen embr yos provided to Thomson's laborator y by Josef ItskovitzEldor, of the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel. The ES cell line from the fifth, fresh embr yo was derived from an embr yo donated in Wisconsin. To generate human ES cell cultures, cells from the inner cell mass of a human blastocyst were cultured in a multi-step process. The pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass were separated from the surrounding trophectoderm by immunosurger y, the antibodymediated dissolution of the trophectoderm. The inner cell masses were plated in culture dishes containing growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum on feeder layers of mouse embr yonic fibroblasts that had been gamma-irradiated to prevent their replication. After 9 to 15 days, when inner cell masses had divided and formed clumps of cells, cells from the peripher y of the clumps were chemically or mechanically dissociated and replated in the same culture conditions. Colonies of apparently homogeneous cells were selectively removed, mechanically dissociated, and replated. These were expanded and passaged, thus creating a cell line. None of the initial 5 human ES cell lines generated in this manner was derived clonally (cloned from a  single cell and are, therefore, genetically identical) [35] (see Figure C.1. Techniques for Generating Embr yonic Stem Cell Cultures). The five original human ES cell lines continued to divide without differentiating for 5 to 6 months [35]. Since then, the H9 line has divided for nearly two years in vitro, for more than 300 population doublings and has yielded two subclones, H9.1 and H9.2 [1] 1. All the ES cell lines express high levels of telomerase [1, 36], the enzyme that helps maintain telomeres which protect the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity and long telomeres are characteristic of proliferating cells in embr yonic tissues and of germ cells. Human somatic cells, however, do not show telomerase activity and their telomeres are considerably shorter. Unlike ES cells, differentiated somatic cells also stop dividing in culture--a phenomenon called replicative senescence (see Figure C.2. Telomeres and Telomerase). Three of the human ES cell lines generated by Thomson were XY (male) and two were XX (female); all maintained a normal kar yotype. Like monkey ES cells [34], human ES cells express a panel of sur face makers that include the stage-specific embr yonic antigens SSEA-3 and SSEA-4, as well as TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase [14, 25, 26, 35]. Mouse ES cells do not express SSEA-3 or SSEA-4; they express SSEA-1, which human and monkey ES cells do not. Human ES cells also express the transcription factor Oct-4 [26], as mouse ES cells do. A somewhat different technique for deriving and culturing human ES cells has now been reported by  1  The H9.1 and H9.2 clonal cell lines were produced by first plating 105 of the parent H9 cells per well in tissue-culture plates. The culture medium contained KnockOut Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (a serum-free substitute for the 20% fetal bovine serum used in the 1998 experiments), and basic FGF, which is necessar y to maintain cell proliferation and prevent differentiation. To generate clonal cell lines from individual H9 ES cells, 384 single cells were removed from these cultures and transferred individually to the wells of larger plates that contained non-dividing mouse embr yonic fibroblasts (MEF) as feeder layers. The single ES cells proliferated and, ever y 7 days, were dissociated and replated, a process that generate two clonal cell lines, H9.1 and H9.2.

Telomeres and Telomerase. A telomere is a repeating sequence of double-stranded DNA located at the ends of chromosomes. Greater telomere length is associated with immortalized cell lines such as embr yonic stem cells and cancer cells. As cells divide and differentiate throughout the lifespan of an organism or cell line, the telomeres become progressively shortened and lose the ability to maintain their length. Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres by adding on repeating sequences of DNA. Telomerase binds to the ends of the telomere via an RNA template that is used for the attachment of a new strand of DNA. Telomerase adds several repeated DNA sequences then releases and a second enzyme, DNA Polymerase, attaches the opposite or complementar y strand of DNA completing the double stranded extension of the chromosome ends. High levels of telomerase activity are detected in embr yonic stem cells and cancer cells, whereas little or no telomerase activity is present in most mature, differentiated cell types. The functions of telomeres and telomerase appear to be important in cell division, normal development, and aging.  C-3   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  investigators in Singapore and Australia. The human blastocysts are cultured in Singapore, where monolayer cultures of human ES cells growing on feeder layers are prepared. The primar y cultures are shipped to Australia, where the colonies of growing cells are dissociated mechanically and replated. LIF and fetal bovine serum are added to the growth medium. The cells do not grow well without serum, although it is not clear that LIF has any effect. Under these in vitro conditions, the ES cells tend to clump and differentiate spontaneously as they are passaged. In vivo, after injection into the testes of immunocompromised mice, the ES cells differentiate into bone, cartilage, squamous and cuboidal epithelium, neural cells, glandular epithelium, and striated muscle [25, 26]. Six human ES cell lines have been generated from 12 blastocysts, a high yield by any standard. The original two cell lines were generated from fresh embr yos; the other four cells lines were generated from frozen embr yos [23]. Recent reports have identified additional human ES cell lines that have been developed. New derivations have been conducted from the blastocyst of frozen embr yos at two centers in India (National Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore; Harkishondas Hospital in collaboration with Reliance Biotechnology, Bombay). They used derivation techniques that differ from those of the Thomson laborator y including the use of laser ablation for the removal of the inner cell mass [22, 24, 33, 36]. An additional preparation of human ES cell lines has been conducted in San Francisco [10]. There are no publications to date on these cell lines and the extent of the research being conducted is not known. By several criteria, all of the human ES cell lines generated to date are pluripotent. When injected under the skin or into the testes of immunocompromised mice--an in vivo method of determining pluripotency --the human ES cells form teratomas that contain derivatives of all three primar y germ layers. When allowed to differentiate in vitro (by culturing the cells in the absence of MEF feeder layers), the human ES cells differentiate spontaneously. Subsequent studies indicate that in vitro differentiation of these human ES cell lines is extensive; the cells can generate many cell types that are derived from all three primar y germ layers [1, 14, 25, 26]. However, the extent to which these human ES cell lines will differentiate in vitro does not match their more extensive differentiation capability in vivo (in teratomas) [19].  METHODS FOR THE DERIVATION AND CULTURE OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS To derive cultures of human embr yonic germ (EG)-like cells, Gearhart and his colleagues grew cells from 38 initial cultures of primordial germ cells (PGC), which were obtained from the gonadal ridge and mesenter y of 5 to 9-week gestation fetal tissue. (PGCs give rise to the germ cells, eggs and sperm, in the adult.) The PGCs were mechanically and chemically dissociated, then plated on a feeder layer of non-dividing, mouse STO fibroblasts in growth medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum [31]. Unlike the growth conditions initially reported for human ES cells [35], the medium for human PGCs cells also contained the cytokine, leukemia inhibitor y factor (LIF), a mitogen (basic fibroblast growth factor, bFGF), and forskolin. After one to three weeks in vitro, the human PGCs had formed dense, multilayered colonies of cells that resembled mouse ES or EG cells. Cells in these colonies expressed SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA1-60, TRA-1-81, and alkaline phosphatase. A small, variable percentage (1 to 20 %) of the PGC-derived cell colonies spontaneously formed embr yoid bodies. The growth medium for embr yoid body cultures lacked LIF, bFGF, and forskolin. The embr yoid bodies were collected from the cultures and either examined for the cell types they contained, or replated into single wells of a tissue culture plate for 14 days. The range of cell types in the human PGC-derived embr yoid bodies included derivatives of all three embr yonic germ layers--endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm--based on the appearance of the cells and the sur face markers they expressed. This result was interpreted to mean that the PGC-derived cells were pluripotent, however, it was not possible to demonstrate pluripotency in vivo by generating the formation of teratomas in mice [31]. In their next series of experiments, Gearhart and his collaborators devised methods for growing stem cells derived from human EG cells. The process requires the generation of embr yoid bodies, which form spontaneously from EG cells that remain attached to the substrate. The embr yoid bodies then float freely in the culture medium. Each embr yoid body consists of an unpredictable mix of partially differentiated cell types, but allowing the embr yoid bodies to form is the most  C-4   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  consistent way of allowing EG-derived cells to differentiate [11]. The process involves several stages of cell derivation in a different kinds of growth media. Cells from low-serum cultures were passaged, chemically dissociated, and resuspended in a culture media that contains 50% fetal bovine serum, and frozen in this state. To measure proliferation, cultures are derived from the frozen embr yoid bodies and grown in the same media used to grow the dissociated cells. Clonal cell lines are then derived from the embr yoid body-derived cultures [32]. The embr yoid body-derived cells resulting from this process have high proliferative capacity and gene expression patterns that are representative of multiple cell lineages. This suggests that the embr yoid bodyderived cells are progenitor or precursor cells for a variety of differentiated cell types [11]. Recently, Neil Hanley and David Wilson from the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, have derived EG cells from the primordial germ cells of the fetal gonadal ridge. Using material at 8 -10 weeks gestation, cells were derived slightly differently form the methods of Shamblott et al using a combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder layers and gelatin coated tissue culture dishes [12]. This method and the further characterization of the alkaline phosphatase/ SSEA1-positive EG cells currently remains unpublished.  growth factor (bFGF). Other growth factors, such as activin-A and transforming growth factorbeta 1 (TGF-1) trigger the differentiation of mesodermallyderived cells. Two other factors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and ner ve growth factor (NGF), promote differentiation into all three germ layers, including endoderm. When these eight growth factors were added individually to cell cultures derived from embr yoid bodies (generated from the H9 line from Thomson's laborator y), the cells differentiated into 11 cell types that represented all three germ layers. The identify of the differentiated human embr yoid bodyderived cells was determined by their morphology, growth characteristics and expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for specific markers [30] (see Figure A.6 Gene Transcription, Translation, and Protein Synthesis). Human embr yoid body-derived cells will differentiate spontaneously into many kinds of cells, without the addition of growth factors. However, the addition of one of a number of growth factors resulted in cultures that were more likely to be populated by only one or two types of differentiated cells, as measured by mRNA transcripts expressed by the cells. Human embr yoid body-derived cultures treated with bFGF differentiated largely into epidermal epithelial cells that express keratin, a protein in skin. Cells in activinAtreated cultures formed muscle cell-like syncytium --fused, multinucleated populations of similar cells-- that express the enzyme muscle-specific enolase. And cultures treated with retinoic acid differentiated into cells that resemble neurons and express neurofilament H. However, the same growth factor typically induced the expression of multiple markers; none of the resulting cell populations was homogeneous [30]. Spontaneous differentiation of human ES cells into hematopoietic cells, which form all the lineages of blood cells, is rare in vitro. However, by co-culturing human ES cells with mouse bone marrow stromal cells (irradiated to prevent their replication) in growth medium that contains fetal bovine serum, but no added growth factors, the cells differentiate to form what appear to be hematopoietic precursor cells. The partly differentiated cells express CD34, a marker for blood cell precursors. If these partly differentiated human ES cells are replated under conditions that allow them to form colonies of hematopoietic cells, they differentiate into er ythroid cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and megakar yocytes [19] (see Chapter 5. Hematopoietic Stem Cells).  DIRECTED DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS IN VITRO As with cultures of mouse ES cells, human ES cells begin to differentiate if they are removed from feeder layers and grown in suspension culture on a nonadherent sur face. The human ES cells form embr yoid bodies which, in the early stages, may be simple or cystic and filled with fluid. Although human embr yoid bodies var y in their cellular content, many include cells that look like neurons and heart muscle cells [14, 25, 26]. After the human embr yoid bodies form, they can be dissociated and replated in monolayer cultures which are then exposed to specific growth factors that influence further cell differentiation. Some growth factors induce cell types that would normally be derived from ectoderm in the embr yo; these include retinoic acid, epidermal growth factor (EGF), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and basic fibroblast  C-5   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  As indicated, human ES cells maintained in vitro have tendency to differentiate spontaneously, a characteristic that may not always be desirable. Thus, it may be necessar y to devise methods that allow undifferentiated ES cells be selected from a culture that contains a mixture of differentiated, partially differentiated, and undifferentiated cells types. The undifferentiated ES cells could then be used for the purposes of directed differentiation, or they could be removed from cultures in which the differentiated cell types are the desired product. In either case, a suggested method for identifying undifferentiated ES cells is to introduce a marker gene--such as that encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP)--whose expression is driven by a gene that is specifically expressed in proliferating, undifferentiated cells, such as Rex1. Then, undifferentiated cells that express GFP can be selectively removed from human ES cultures by using a fluorescence activated cells sorter (FACS) [9] (see Appendix E.i. Markers: How Do Researchers Use Them to Identify Stem Cells?). Joseph Itskovitz-Eldor and his colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into cardiac myocytes. They use several of the human ES lines generated in James Thomson's laborator y. They report a number of cells in embr yoid bodies that have contractile activity and express genetic markers consistent commonly found in cardiac myocytes [16] (see Chapter 9. Can Stem Cells Repair a Damaged Heart?). Karl Skorecki and his collaborators have had success in directing the differentiation of human ES cell lines (originating from the Thomson laborator y derivation) into pancreatic islet-like cells that secrete insulin. They have also reported the expression of insulin genes found in islet-like cells of the pancreas [6] (see Chapter 7. Stem Cells and Diabetes). A new report indicates that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of human EG cells into neuronal cells that may play a role in restoring some function to paralyzed animals. The SDEC human cell line in this study was generated from embr yoid bodies that formed in culture by the aggregation of human EG cells, and is referred to as an embr yoidderived cell line. SDEC cells express a panel of neuronal markers that include nestin, neurofilament, tau protein, neuron-specific enolase; the cells also express the glial cells markers glial fibrillar y acidic protein, galactocerebroside, and CNPase. No in vitro assays that indicate cell function have been reported  for SDEC cell assays. However, when SDEC cells were injected into the central canal of the spinal cord of rats--whose hind limbs were paralyzed by an induced form of amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease)--the majority of animals showed some functional recover y. It is not clear whether the human embr yoid body-derived cells replaced some of the spinal motor neurons damaged by the experimental ALS, or whether the injected cells triggered neurons in the recipient animals to recover lost function [17] (see Chapter 8. Rebuilding the Ner vous System with Stem Cells). Several groups of investigators are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cell lines, but their work is not yet published. They reported their findings in inter views with the NIH or during presentations at scientific meetings. They include, but are not limited to, the following:  Martin Pera, Alan Trounson, and their coworkers are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells along a neural lineage using the BMP antagonist noggin. They generate an apparently homogenous population of cells, but have not yet characterized it [23].  Brenda Kahan, Jon Odorico, and their coworkers are tr ying to direct the differentiation of the human ES lines H1 and H9 into pancreatic islet cells, which are endodermal derivatives. They induce the formation of embr yoid bodies in medium lacking bFGF and assay cultures for the expression of transcripts for the endodermal markers hnf3, lfabp, ifabp, and villin 1. Differentiated progeny from these cells express the genes for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin, which are normally expressed in pancreatic islet cells [15].  Micha Drukker, Nissim Benvenisty, and their colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neurons by adding retinoic acid or -NGF to the growth medium. They report that about 80% of embr yoid bodies exposed to these factors contain differentiated neuronal cells, as determined by morphology and the expression of receptors for dopamine or serotonin [8].  Su-Chang Zhang, James Thomson, and their collaborators are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neural epithelial cells, by  C-6   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  selecting cells from embr yoid bodies that express nestin, glial fibrillar y acidic protein (GFAP , an astrocyte marker), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and Musashi-1. The differentiated cell types express (as yet unidentified) markers of neurons and glial cells. After transplantation into the mouse brain, the cells aggregated into clusters and migrate into the brain parenchyma where they express (unidentified) neural and glial markers. By 10 weeks after transplantation, the human embr yoid-derived cells had not formed teratomas [38].  Margaret Inokuma, Melissa Carpenter, and their colleagues are tr ying to direct the differentiation of human ES cells into neural cells using neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF). Some of the resulting cells stain positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the ratelimiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis) or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), an inhibitor y neurotransmitter [13].  Chunhui Xu, Melissa Carpenter, and their colleagues report preliminar y data on growing human ES cells in vitro in serum-free medium without feeder layers. The details of their method have not been published but apparently include Matrigel or laminin as a substrate, basic FGF, and conditioned medium from cultures of mouse embr yo fibroblasts [39].  J.S. Lebkowski and Margaret Inokuma et al. report methods for using genetic modification and changes in culture conditions to direct the differentiation of the human ES cell lines H1 and H7 in vitro. They grow undifferentiated human ES cells in serum-free medium on Matrigel or laminin, and then add 20% serum replacement medium plus DMSO to direct the first stage of differentiation. The second stage is induced by adding sodium butyrate to the medium. Cell maturation occurs in a third medium (not described). To induce differentiation into neural cells, they allow the human ES cells to form embr yoid bodies, which are then expanded, and plated in B27 medium (not described), with FGF and EGF. The resulting cells express the neural progenitor markers psNCAM and A2B5.  Some differentiated cells express the glial marker GFAP Other cells express the neuronal markers . -tubulin III and synaptophysin, or stain for the neurotransmitters GABA, tyrosine hydroxylase, or glutamate. No quantitative data, electrophysiological data, or responses to neurotransmitter application are reported [18].  HUMAN EMBRYONIC CARCINOMA CELLS Embr yonal carcinoma (EC) cells are the ""stem cells"" that occur in unusual germ cell tumors, also called teratocarcinomas. As such, they give rise to the differentiated cell types that also occur in the tumors. The tumors probably arise from a malignant form of a primordial germ cell. In humans, germ cell tumors occur most often in the testis of young men; these are always malignant, but usually treatable. Benign germ tumors called ovarian cysts can occur in the ovar y; malignant ovarian germ cell tumors are much rarer (malignant ovarian tumors  usually referred to as ovarian cancer  are not germ cell tumors). Germ cell tumors have been studied extensively in humans and mice. They contain an aberrant mix of differentiated cell types, rather than a single kind of tumor cell. Small groups of the cells may appear organized, but overall, the tissue in the tumor is disorganized. Teratocarcinomas are of particular interest because they contain EC cells, which in many ways resemble normal ES cells [4]. Like human ES cells, human EC cells proliferate extensively in vitro and in teratomas formed in vivo after injection into immunocompromised mice. Because research on human ES cells is so recent, a direct comparison of cultured human EC cells and human ES cells has just begun.2 Both cell types express a panel of sur face markers, including the embr yonic stage-specific antigens SSEA-3 and SSEA-4. Neither human ES cells nor human EC cells expresses SSEA-1, as mouse ES and EC cells do [5, 26, 35]. Conversely, mouse EC and ES cells do not express SSEA-3 or SSEA-4. Human EC and ES cells also carr y on their surfaces keratin sulfate proteoglycans that can be labeled with specific antibodies, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81 [3, 7]. Also, unlike their mouse counterparts,  2  As of May 9, 2001, the comparisons between human ES cells and EC cells have been made only in Peter Andrews' laborator y at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. James Thomson, of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, supplied Andrews with four lines of human ES cells [3, 32].  C-7   Appendix C: Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells  human ES and EC cells express MHC Class I antigens, which are responsible for immunogenicity (see Chapter 6. Autoimmune Diseases and the Promise of Stem Cell-Based Therapies). Like mouse ES and EC cells, undifferentiated human ES and EC cells strongly express the transcription factor Oct-4 [26, 4], which is widely regarded as a hallmark of pluripotent embr yonic cells [20, 28, 29] (see Table C.1. Comparison of Mouse, Monkey, and Human Pluripotent Stem Cells).  Human ES and EC cells differ in important ways. Human ES cells are euploid, meaning they carr y the normal complement of chromosomes. In contrast, human EC cells are aneuploid; their chromosomes are distinctly abnormal. (Interestingly, the chromosomes in mouse EC cells do not appear as abnormal, although they do carr y subtle chromosomal abnormalities.) The ability of both cell types to differentiate into various tissue types has been explored by injecting human ES and EC cells into  Table C.1.

Injected human ES cells will form embr yonic stem cell teratomas in mice, and the tumors consist of cells derived from all three primar y germ layers [36]. In contrast, human EC cell lines var y in their ability to differentiate in vivo, but in general are more limited than are ES cells. For example, NTERA2 cl.D1 cells (which are derived from human TERA2 EC cells) generate only a few kinds of tissues, including primitive gut-like structures, and neural tissue after injection into immunocompromised mice [2]. The in vitro growth characteristics of human ES and EC cells are also being compared. Both cell types grow well in serum-containing medium on feeder layers of mouse embr yonic fibroblasts that have been treated to block their proliferation. It is difficult to induce human ES cells to proliferate in the absence of feeder layers, unless conditioned medium from feeder cells cultures is added. However, many human EC cells lines, such as the NTERA2 line, are not dependent on feeder layers [2]. If human ES cells are removed from their feeder layers, they differentiate spontaneously into many cell types. Mouse ES cells, after removal from feeder layers, can be stimulated to divide and prevented from differentiating by adding LIF (leukemia inhibitor y factor); neither human ES nor EC cells show this response to LIF. Instead, if human ES cells grow to confluence (where the cells grow to completely cover the culture plates), the cells aggregate and begin to differentiate spontaneously [26, 35]. Also, human ES cells grown in suspension cultures at high density will form embr yoid bodies. Embr yoid bodies are clumps or groupings of cells that form when cultured in plates or media and do not occur in nature. Embr yoid bodies contain undifferentiated and partially differentiated cells [14]. However, human EC cells remain undifferentiated when grown at high density [4]. Whether these apparent differences in the in vitro growth characteristics of human ES and EC cells are meaningful or real is subject to debate [5]. The pluripotency of human EC cells does not equal that of human ES cells. Human ES cells can differentiate into a wide range of cell types in vitro, and can form teratomas with many cell types after injection into immune-deficient mice. The differentiation potential of most lines of human EC cells is more limited, both in vitro and in vivo. One human EC cell line, however, TERA2, differentiates easily in vitro. The  well-studied morphogen, retinoic acid, induces TERA2 cells (and the subline NTERA2) to differentiate into neural precursors, which can then become mature neurons [4]. But when human ES cells are exposed to retinoic acid, they differentiate into a wider array of cell types than do human EC cells. As yet, it is not clear how the mechanism of action of retinoic acid differs in human ES cells versus human EC cells. It may be that, because of their tumor origin, human EC cells carr y genetic variations linked to tumorigenesis that restrict their capacity for differentiation [5]. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of human EC cells resembles that of human ES cells in certain respects, but not in others. Although ES cells will likely prove to be a better model for understanding human development than will EC cells [27], there may be some aspects of development that EC cells will reveal that ES cells will not [5].

GX257-06-13972502	Poster #1 (Presenter's Name Is Underlined) Alternative Methods for Culturing Human Embryonic Stem Cells Amit, M., Margulets, V., Shariki, K., and Itskovitz-Eldor, J. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Introduction: The availability of human embryonic stem (hES) cells reflects their outstanding potential for research areas, such as human developmental biology, teratology, and cell-based therapies. To allow their continuous growth in an undifferentiated state, isolation and culturing were traditionally conducted on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers, using medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. However, these conditions allow the possible exposure of the cells to animal pathogens. Because both research and future clinical application require an animal-free and well-defined culture system for hES cells, these conditions would prevent the use of hES cells in human therapy. This study confronts this challenge and describes optional culture conditions based on medium supplemented with serum replacement. Methods: hES cell lines I3, I6, I3.2, and H9 were transferred from the MEF culture system to medium supplemented with 15% SR and 4ng/ml bFGF on either MEF matrix, foreskin fibroblast matrix, Matrigel matrix, or fibronectin. When fresh (and unconditioned) medium was used, additional known growth factors were added. Following a prolonged culture of more than 20 passages, cells were examined for ES cell characteristics. Results: All hES cell lines maintained their ES cell features: They continued to proliferate as undifferentiated cells for at least 20 passages as demonstrated by the expression of undifferentiated-specific surface markers; when grown in suspension for over 17 passages, they formed embryoid bodies similar to those formed on MEFs; in vivo, the cells created teratomas containing representative tissues of the three embryonic germ layers, and normal karyotypes were retained. All matrices were found to support hES cell culture with the same efficiency. Conclusions: The culture system presented here has two major advantages: (1) the elimination or significant restriction of hES cells' exposure to animal pathogens and (2) the application of a well-defined culture system.
GX256-11-6067611	"Stem cells are special cells in the body that have not yet committed themselves to a final function. As illustrated by this diagram, a stem cell can differentiate into a number of different cell types (represented by the different colors) that may then be part of the same organ or tissue, such as the pancreatic islet cell cluster represented at the bottom. As they learn how to guide the development of stem cells present in adult tissues, researchers may be able to develop therapies for a number of diseases in which these tissues are damaged or malfunctioning.

While the ultimate application of such basic research is not always obvious to the public, major strides in fighting disease can be traced back to laboratory studies whose immediate relevance to health could not have been fully known or appreciated at the time they were conducted. Described here are some recent studies of fundamental processes, as well as the technologies that make such studies possible. The insights gained through this type of research can be expected to propel disease-oriented research, not only within the NIDDK mission, but also in many other fields. Investment in such cross-cutting scientific research today will have future applications that we cannot now describe with certainty, but which we know will surely be realized.  A  F UNCTIONAL G ENOMICS : T OOLS FOR D ISCOVERING THE F UNCTIONS OF G ENES R ELEVANT TO D ISEASE  I  n the quest for new and better treatments for disease, bbiomedical scientists are creating and using exciting advances in modern technology to discover important genes and learn their functions at an ever-increasing rate. This knowledge can propel new advances in diagnostics and drug development. Because different diseases and medical conditions arise from disparate causes--mutations in genes, infectious agents, and even adverse reactions to certain medical therapies--scientists delve into the inner workings of living cells with a great diversity of approaches. In genetic research, genes are often identified, and clues to their function obtained, by investigating what goes wrong when a gene is mutated, as is the case in many diseases. The study of genes has been revolutionized by modern functional genomics, the use of largescale, high-throughput techniques to discover the 5  function of genes and how all the genes in the genome of an organism work together. For example, scientists can now scan hundreds or thousands of genes at a time to see which may be active in a certain type of cell. For cases in which a disease is caused by a mutation in a gene that is already known from previous research, new technologies are also expediting experiments in which scientists generate an animal with an analogous mutation. From the animal model of the disease, they can learn how the disease progresses and what other genes may be involved, and they can use these animal models to test candidate therapies that are not yet ready for human trials. Because most genes are blueprints for the construction of specific proteins, scientists also gain critical insights into disease by studying how proteins function--or malfunction--when genes are mutated. In parallel with investigations into the causes of particular diseases, researchers also seek to build upon fundamental knowledge of genes and their functions to perpetuate the cycle of scientific discovery: critical insights and breakthroughs in medicine are often predicated upon the accumulation of such knowledge and upon the development of new technologies. Thus, investment in genetic and genomic research can be expected to have cross-cutting implications, advancing medical research within the NIDDK mission and in other fields as well. Modeling the Control of Cell Growth Through Mice: Cancer is the result of uncontrolled cell growth. Normally, the body regulates when a cell should grow and divide to produce new cells where they are needed, and when the growth should stop. A cell must also carefully monitor its genome as it grows to ensure that if mutations arise, they are not propagated into new cells. How this elaborate regulatory system breaks down to allow mutant cells to grow into tumors has been the subject of much research. Mouse models of cancer are particularly useful to researchers precisely because they provide insights into the development of cancer in the context of a whole Cross-Cutting Science   organism, where all of the regulatory systems should normally be in place. Cell Growth and DNA Damage in Breast Cancer: Breast cancer strikes approximately one in nine women. It can be caused by new mutations or by mutations that were inherited. Many of the hereditary cases of breast cancer are caused by mutations in the gene BRCA1. BRCA1 appears to be a central player in many biological pathways, including regulating cell growth and maintaining the integrity of the genome through repair of DNA damage. Thus, mutations in this gene are particularly insidious because without BRCA1, cells are left vulnerable to acquiring even more mutations. While some mutations are caused by environmental factors, other mutations just occur spontaneously in cells. One of the body's defenses against DNA damage is to have cells die rather than perpetuate potentially harmful mutations; this programmed cell death is called ""apoptosis."" How do some BRCA1 mutant cells escape death and instead grow uncontrollably into tumors? Scientists recently deduced that some of these cells do so by mutating the protein that imposes the death sentence: this protein is called p53. In studies in mice, NIDDK-funded scientists found that BRCA1 mutations resulted in massive numbers of dead cells as a result of apoptosis. This was likely in response to DNA damage, the result of the accumulation of many spontaneously arising mutations left unchecked in the absence of BRCA1. Surprisingly, this massive cell death was not seen in mice that both lacked BRCA1 and additionally had a mutation that impaired p53 function--and most of these mice eventually developed breast tumors. These results are particularly significant to human cancer because BRCA1-associated tumors have a relatively high frequency of p53 mutations. Mutations in p53 have long been associated with many types of human cancers. One possible reason for this is that p53 can suppress uncontrolled cell growth in several ways, including by triggering cell death. To further investigate the interactions between p53 and BRCA1, the researchers induced extensive DNA damage in mice by exposing them to radiation. The cells of normal mice bolstered their levels of p53 protein to help protect against the damaging effects of the radiation, but in mice with BRCA1 mutations, the p53 response was impaired. These results help show that in normal cells, BRCA1 and p53 must coordinate to protect Cross-Cutting Science 6  against conditions that can lead to cancer. These experiments suggest a mechanism for BRCA1mediated tumor formation. In the absence of normal BRCA1 function, mutations accumulate in the DNA. In some cells, this DNA damage eventually strikes the gene encoding the p53 protein, causing a mutation that destroys it. Once p53 function is lost, these mutant cells can escape death, continue to grow and divide, and eventually form tumors. The mice developed in this study, with BRCA1 and p53 mutations, will continue to be of value to increase our understanding of cancer progression; these mice may also serve as useful models to test new treatments for breast cancer. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia: Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a cancer syndrome characterized by multiple tumors in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, anterior pituitary, and other parts of the body. It is caused by mutations in a gene called MEN1 (for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1), which was discovered by the collaborative efforts of NIH scientists from the NIDDK, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Human Genome Research Institute. To gain further insight into this cancer syndrome, scientists recently generated a mouse model of the disease. Like humans, mice have two copies of the MEN1 gene. Using genetic engineering, the researchers mutated one of these copies. The mice developed symptoms remarkably similar to human multiple endocrine neoplasia, including tumors in the pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary, and other tissues. The scientists observed that the tumor cells had spontaneously lost the remaining normal copy of the MEN1 gene. Future research on these mice may reveal whether other genetic events accompany tumor formation. Ultimately, as current therapies for this syndrome are often unsatisfactory, the availability of a mouse model should be an asset for the testing of possible new therapeutic approaches. Unfolding Protein Folding: Just as gears and wires must be perfectly crafted to make a machine work, the proteins of the human body must assume very distinct shapes to perform the functions necessary for life. A gear of the wrong shape or a mass of wires tangled randomly together will disrupt a machine's function. Likewise, an improperly-shaped protein, or certain aggregates of proteins interacting abnormally, can lead to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's and ""mad cow"" disease. Proteins are chains of amino acid building blocks; the   nature and order of amino acids in each protein are dictated by the sequence of the gene encoding the protein. Each amino acid chain must ""fold"" into a particular intricate shape so that the protein can function. A mutation in a gene that changes the nature of even just one of the amino acids can make it impossible for the protein to fold properly. A few types of proteins seem to be able to change their structure spontaneously--more alarmingly, some of these proteins sabotage the folding of other proteins, even in the absence of genetic mutations. Proteins that can do this after infecting a living organism are called prions. Research on prions and on abnormal aggregates of misshaped proteins, called amyloids, continues to shed light on protein-folding diseases and will lead to new ideas for treatment approaches. Prions and Amyloids in a Yeast Model System: Many diseases that ravage the brain, such as the much-feared mad cow disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are caused by infectious proteins called prions. In recent years, creative experiments by NIDDK-funded scientists in a seemingly unlikely model system--baker's yeast--have provided insights not only into prion formation, but also into amyloids, which are abnormal forms of protein observed in many diseases. Yeast are ideal model organisms for investigating many biological processes because they are readily amenable to highly sophisticated genetic manipulation and other experimental techniques; they require little storage and growth space; and they are relatively inexpensive to grow. (Such features would contrast sharply, for example, with a herd of ""mad cows"" that one might wish to study.) Yeast also have their own set of prions which, like those of animals and people, often start out as normal proteins but then spontaneously change into a sinister form. Prions propagate by converting other proteins into this abnormal form. One such yeast prion is called [URE3], which is an altered form of a normal yeast protein called Ure2p. Scientists recently learned that yeast prions such as [URE3] do not propagate by themselves: they use other proteins, called chaperones, as unwitting accomplices to help them convert more Ure2p proteins into [URE3] prions. Further experiments showed that [URE3] prions aggregate together to form networks of amyloid filaments, which resemble amyloid found in a number of human diseases, including Alzheimer's, late-onset diabetes, multiple myeloma, and transmissible spongi7  form encephalopathies. Continued research on yeast prions will generate further insights into both prion disease and amyloid formation and propagation. Protein Folding in Amyloid Disease--Implications for Therapy: A recent study of the disease familial amyloid polyneuropathy explained an intriguing case of two genetic wrongs making a right. The disease is caused by a mutant version of the protein transthyretin. People have two copies of the gene for transthyretin, one from each parent. If one copy is normal, but the other copy codes for a protein with a mutation called ""V30M,"" then disease occurs. (V30M is a shorthand designation that scientists use to note that the 30th amino acid building block of the protein is mutant. The chemical nature of the defect is abbreviated by the letters V and M.) Curiously, individuals are protected from disease if the second copy of the transthyretin gene--rather than being normal--has a different mutation, called ""T119M."" NIDDK-funded scientists recently discovered how the T119M mutation overcomes the adverse effects of the V30M mutant. Transthyretin proteins usually snap together in groups of four, but the V30M mutation renders them unable to maintain this normal configuration. Separated from the group, the individual proteins with the V30M mutation begin to unfold, lose their characteristic shape, and then aggregate in a harmful mass that interferes with nerve and muscle function. By contrast, scientists found that proteins with the T119M mutation exert an especially stabilizing influence on the transthyretin group, even if the foursome includes some of the V30M mutants. (Not all mutations, then, are bad.) The extra stability of the T119M version of transthyretin counteracts the unfolding propensity of the proteins carrying the V30M mutation. The implications of this finding are that this amyloid disease--and potentially others like it, such as Alzheimer's--may be amenable to treatment strategies designed to stabilize the proper groups of proteins to prevent misfolding. ""Insights"" into the Digestive System--Feeding Fluorescent Fats to Zebrafish: In a clever new approach to identify genes involved in fat processing, scientists combined modern genetic techniques with glow-in-the-dark fats. The model organisms they used, zebrafish larvae, process fats in the intestine and liver and respond to cholesterol-blocking drugs in a manner similar to humans. Thus, genes identified as important in zebraCross-Cutting Science   fish for fat processing are likely to be important in humans also. Zebrafish are common pets throughout the world. In recent years, however, they have acquired a new purpose: they have become established as a powerful model organism for biological research. Zebrafish are readily amenable to genetic manipulation, facilitating the identification and characterization of genes. They are vertebrates, with organ systems similar to those of people and other mammals. Because zebrafish are relatively small, scientists can maintain large numbers of them in the lab. Zebrafish also have a striking characteristic that makes them particularly valuable for studying how internal organs and tissues are formed: during their rapid development, the fish embryos and larvae are transparent, permitting their insides to be viewed easily. Thus, the zebrafish can be a virtual window to enable researchers to see how cells differentiate and organs develop. Exploiting the ability to synthesize fluorescent fats and the ability to perform sophisticated experiments on zebrafish, NIDDK-funded scientists screened for and identified zebrafish larvae with mutations that disrupt proper fat processing. After these mutant larvae were fed fluorescent fats, their gall bladders did not glow as brightly as those of normal larvae. Thus, the scientists can deduce that the genes that were mutated must be important for fat processing. By tracking down the location of the mutations within the genome, the researchers will eventually be able to find and study these important genes. One of the mutants, nick-named ""fat-free,"" had a digestive tract that otherwise appeared normal. Thus, without the use of fluorescent fat technology to detect a defect, this mutant would have been overlooked, and potentially valuable insights into the genetics of the digestive system would have been missed. This research predicts that genetic screens in zebrafish, along with sensitive fluorescent fat technology, may identify genes important for diseases of fat metabolism, biliary disorders, and even certain types of cancer in which fat signaling plays a role. With support from multiple NIH components under the leadership of the NIDDK and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the community of scientists who study zebrafish have been developing sophisticated genomics tools to facilitate the mapping and identification of important genes and to determine their functions. An effort to sequence the entire zebrafish genome is now beginning. Cross-Cutting Science 8  Using a Genetic Database to Prevent Blood Transfusion Reactions: Blood transfusions save the lives of accident victims, surgery patients, and people suffering from blood disorders such as dialysis-induced anemia, sickle cell anemia, and Cooley's anemia. However, patients can develop an adverse reaction to transfused blood if certain molecules displayed on the surface of the donor red blood cells differ from those on the patient's own cells. There are many groups of such surface molecules, including the group used to classify blood into the commonlyknown A, B, or O types. Among the many other blood groups is one called the Dombrock group, named after a blood donor named Dombrock in 1965. A reaction against a surface molecule of the Dombrock group can cause the destruction of transfused blood cells as well as fever, chills, and other symptoms. However, reliable products have not been available to screen blood for the Dombrock type. Recently, with modern large-scale genomic techniques, NIDDK-funded investigators working at the NIH discovered the gene coding for the Dombrock molecules. They began with two clues from prior research. First, genetic studies had linked the Dombrock gene to chromosome 12. Second, research on red blood cells suggested that the Dombrock molecules are anchored to the cell membrane in a specific way. The scientists prepared DNA from developing red blood cells (because mature red blood cells lack chromosomes) and generated a database of 5,000 genes that are active in these cells. They then screened this database to look for a gene that both localized to chromosome 12 and that also had a sequence characteristic of molecules that are anchored to cell membranes in the same way as the Dombrock molecules. The strategy worked. Over thirty years after the initial identification of Dombrock blood types, the gene that encodes the Dombrock molecules has now been cloned. The scientists were even able to find versions of the gene with slight sequence variations that correlate with the different types of Dombrock molecules. With this breakthrough, gene-based methods can now be developed to screen patients, and also donor blood, for Dombrock type. This type of screen would allow doctors to match a patient with donor blood of the same Dombrock type to reduce painful transfusion reactions. This research also illustrates the value of a database of genes that function in red blood cells. Such a database will undoubtedly propel further discoveries in red blood   cell biology in order to better understand and treat human diseases involving these cells. With this as a goal, NIDDK is supporting the development of a large database, called ""Hembase,"" to provide worldwide access to genetic-based studies of red blood cells performed by scientists working at the NIH. Taking Tools into the Future--Building Knowledge of Disease Genes: The NIDDK is continuing to advance biomedical research by identifying and pursuing cross-cutting areas of research within its mission that can be addressed with recent and developing technologies. Modifier genes: The symptoms and severity of all diseases vary from one person to the next due to differences in genetic makeup and environmental exposure. For many medical disorders, a mutation in a single gene plays the predominant role in the development of disease. However, even among those who have identical mutations in such a gene, the severity of the disease can vary. To better understand this phenomenon, it is necessary to find other genes, called ""modifier genes,"" that contribute to this variability. Identifying these modifier genes would improve our ability to predict the symptoms and severity of a disease in a particular individual, and may lead to improved treatments. With the primary genes for many diseases now known, the NIDDK will strive to build upon our understanding of the genetics of these diseases by stimulating research to identify modifier genes. A planned symposium on the search for modifier genes will encompass such diseases as cystic fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease, Gaucher disease, and other disorders within the NIDDK mission. Increasing Understanding of Membrane Transport: Cell membranes are like the walls of a house, with windows and doors that can open to the outside and to interior rooms. On a much smaller but far more elaborate scale, the membranes of living cells are designed to let nutrients and other molecules pass through in a highly-regulated fashion. Many diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, diabetes, renal tubular acidosis, congestive heart failure, and several intestinal disorders, arise from defects in the transport of substances across membranes. Membrane transport processes in humans and other mammals are very similar to those in lower organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, among others. These similarities can be exploited to build upon our knowledge of membrane transport because these non-mammalian 9  organisms are also easily experimentally-manipulated (more so than mammals), and the genome sequences for many of these are also known. The NIDDK plans to support innovative approaches to studying membrane transport in bacteria, yeast, zebrafish, and other nonmammalian organisms, and to search for novel genes and discover how they function. This knowledge will lead to important insights into the workings of human cells and membrane transport-associated diseases. Beta Cell Biology Consortium: Central to the onset and progression of diabetes are abnormalities in cells called beta cells. Beta cells reside in the pancreas and produce insulin, a hormone that is essential for life. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells are destroyed, so no more insulin is produced. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not respond properly to insulin; the beta cell initially compensates by secreting extra insulin but eventually fails, leading to overt diabetes. It is believed that signaling defects involving beta cells are at the root of insufficient insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes. A comprehensive understanding of beta cells will therefore lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches for both forms of this devastating disease. The NIDDK has launched a functional genomics initiative to identify the genes that are critical for beta cell development and to learn how they function. To build on this initiative, the NIDDK proposes to establish a Beta Cell Biology Consortium. Through the Consortium, individual Beta Cell Biology Programs would have access to information, resources, technologies, expertise, and reagents that are beyond the scope of any single research effort. The goals of the Consortium will be to advance our knowledge of beta cell biology and to develop technologies that will have implications for early detection of disease, for therapeutic transplantation of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, and for understanding derangements of cell signaling and regulation in type 2 diabetes. Progenitor Cell Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs): The successful treatment of many chronic and debilitating diseases afflicting Americans today will depend on the ability to replace organs or to stimulate regeneration and recovery of damaged organs. To build upon the achievements of the Human Genome Project, the NIDDK and other NIH institutes have established a range of Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs) to map the complex network of cellular interactions in normal and diseased tissues. In the NIDDK, for example, one new initiative is the Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project, which will look at the Cross-Cutting Science   expression of genes in pancreatic and other tissues affected by diabetes. Now, complementary new research initiatives will apply this same comprehensive approach to focus on progenitor cells. Progenitor cells develop into different types of cells that form the organs and tissues of the body. It is important to understand how tissues and organs develop from progenitor cells, and how progenitor cells maintain and regenerate tissues and organs in health and disease. Approaches will include developing biomarkers to detect and classify stem cells and progenitor cells; profiling the cells to catalogue genes that are active; and creating tools for characterizing the functions of these genes. Such research would not only capitalize on the sequence data from the Human Genome Project, but could also take full advantage of human embryonic stem cell lines which meet established criteria for use in research supported by the NIH. It is also a goal that wellcharacterized cells, DNA, and specific tools for progenitor cell analysis developed by the GAPs will be distributed to the broader research community. Further, the development of bioinformatics systems, including databases, will ensure that data produced are available to researchers worldwide soon after being generated in the laboratories.

S  TEM  C  ELLS  :D  EVELOPING  P  OTENTIAL  S  cientists are striving to understand the processes that boccur during normal development, when a vast number of different cell types are generated from a single fertilized egg. If they can understand normal development, scientists will have a better chance of determining how to recapitulate development in an adult in order to replace cells damaged by disease. Even within adults, special cells known as stem cells retain the ability to divide, and the divisions can give rise either to more stem cells or to cells that will differentiate into specific cell types. This process is analogous to harvested wheat seeds: the farmer can use the seeds either to plant more wheat, as when stem cells divide to produce more stem cells, or to produce specific products such as bread, as when stem cells divide to produce cells that differentiate into specific cell types. Currently, scientists are determining the usefulness of different types of stem cells for treating human disease. Until now, replacement of cells has only been possible via organ or cell transplantation. Doctors are unable to treat every needy patient with transplantation, however, because there are limited supplies of donated cells and organs. Stem cells are heralded as a possible means for overcoming this treatment barrier. The various types of stem cells are believed to differ mainly in the limits of their ""potential""--their ability to produce other cell types. Embryonic stem cells arise early in development. Because they must give rise to all the different cell types and tissues of the body, embryonic stem cells are thought to have almost unlimited potential. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, reside within a mature tissue or organ and are thought to be able to differentiate into a more limited number of cell types. Experiments are still being performed to test the validity of these assumptions. In the past year, NIDDK-funded scientists studying stem cells have made a number of exciting discoveries. Investigators identified a population of adult stem cells present in both rat and human pancreas capable of generating all types of pancreatic cells in culture. Investigators studying adult stem cells in the blood were surprised to discover that they are capable of producing not only numerous types of blood cells, but also liver, lung, gut, and skin cells. Another team showed that stem cells of the adult mouse pancreas are capable of producing both  Cross-Cutting Science  10   pancreas and liver cells. Still another group of investigators developed a new technique for expanding cultured umbilical cord stem cells in order to generate enough cells for a transplant. These studies have all advanced our progress towards developing alternative sources of cells for transplantation to treat human diseases. The NIDDK is supporting several efforts designed to capitalize on and extend previous stem cell and developmental biology discoveries and to stimulate new discoveries. As previously mentioned, two Genome Anatomy Projects (GAPs) support the use of advanced technologies and bioinformatic techniques to describe gene expression patterns in stem cells both during development, and in adult stem cells during tissue maintenance and tissue repair following disease. The planned Progenitor Cell GAPs will support research to identify and describe stem cells located within specific tissues of the gastrointestinal lining, liver, exocrine pancreas, kidney, urinary tract, prostate, and bladder. Hematopoietic Cell Lineage GAPs will support work to describe gene expression in blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. Another NIDDK effort will sponsor studies to describe normal development and stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and exocrine pancreas. The NIDDK hopes that knowledge gained from these studies will enable doctors to use stem cells and developmentally-regulated genes to repair and replace damaged and diseased tissue.

Introduction Research on how healthy scientists to regenerative stem cells is advancing knowledge about how an organism develops from a single cell and cells replace damaged cells in adult organisms. This promising area of science is also leading investigate the possibility of cell-based therapies to treat disease, which is often referred to as or reparative medicine.  Stem cells are one of the most fascinating areas of biology today. But like many expanding fields of scientific inquiry, research on stem cells raises scientific questions as rapidly as it generates new discoveries. The NIH developed this primer to help readers understand the answers to questions such as: What are stem cells? What different types of stem cells are there and where do they come from? What is the potential for new medical treatments using stem cells? What research is needed to make such treatments a reality? A. What are stem cells and why are they important? Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can functions such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or the them from other types of cells. First, they through cell division. The second is that be induced to become cells with special insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.  Scientists primarily work with two kinds of stem cells from animals and humans: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells, which have different functions and characteristics that will be explained in this document. Scientists discovered ways to obtain or derive stem cells from early mouse embryos more than 20 years ago. Many years of detailed study of the biology of mouse stem cells led to the discovery, in 1998, of how to isolate stem cells from human embryos and grow the cells in the laboratory. These are called human embryonic stem cells. The embryos used in these studies were created for infertility purposes through in vitro fertilization procedures and when they were no longer needed for that purpose, they were donated for research with the informed consent of the donor. Stem cells are important for living organisms for many reasons. In the 3 to 5 day old embryo, called a blastocyst, a small group of about 30 cells called the inner cell mass gives rise to the hundreds of highly specialized cells needed to make up an adult organism. In the developing fetus, stem cells in developing tissues give rise to the multiple specialized cell types that make up the heart, lung, skin, and other tissues. In some adult tissues, such as bone marrow, muscle, and brain, discrete populations of adult stem cells generate replacements for cells that are lost through normal wear and tear, injury, or disease. It has been hypothesized by scientists that stem cells may, at some point in the future, become the basis for treating diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease. Scientists want to study stem cells in the laboratory so they can learn about their essential properties and what makes them different from specialized cell types. As scientists learn more about stem cells, it may become possible to use the cells not just in cell-based therapies, but also for screening new drugs and toxins and understanding birth defects. However, as mentioned above, human embryonic stem cells have only been studied since 1998. Therefore, in order to develop such treatments scientists are intensively studying the fundamental properties of stem cells, which include: 1) determining precisely how stem cells remain unspecialized and self renewing for many years; and 2) identifying the signals that cause stem cells to become specialized cells. B. Scope of this document This primer on stem cells is intended for anyone who wishes to learn more about the biological properties of stem cells, the important questions about stem cells that are the focus of scientific research, and the potential use of stem cells in research and in treating disease. The primer includes information about stem cells derived from the embryo and adult. Much of the information included here is about stem cells derived from human tissues, but some studies of animal-derived stem cells are also described. II. What are the unique properties of all stem cells? Stem cells differ from other kinds of cells in the body. All stem cells -- regardless of their source -- have three general properties: they are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods; they are unspecialized; and they can give rise to specialized cell types. Stem Cells for the Future Treatment of Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is a very common neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 2% of the population over 65 years of age. PD is caused by a progressive degeneration and loss of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons, which leads to tremor, rigidity, and hypokinesia (abnormally decreased mobility). It is thought that PD may be the first disease to be amenable to treatment using stem cell transplantation. Factors that support this notion include the knowledge of the specific cell type (DA neurons) needed to relieve the symptoms of the disease. In addition, several laboratories have been successful in developing methods to induce embryonic stem cells to differentiate into cells with many of the functions of DA neurons. In a recent study, scientists directed mouse embryonic stem cells to differentiate into DA neurons by introducing the gene Nurr1. When transplanted into the brains of a rat model of PD, these stem cell-derived DA neurons reinnervated the brains of the rat Parkinson model, released dopamine and improved motor function. Regarding human stem cell therapy, scientists are developing a number of strategies for producing dopamine neurons from human stem cells in the laboratory for transplantation into humans with Parkinson's disease. The successful generation of an unlimited supply of dopamine neurons could make neurotransplantation widely available for Parkinson's patients at some point in the future.   Scientists are trying to understand two fundamental properties of stem cells that relate to their long-term self-renewal: 1) why can embryonic stem cells proliferate for a year or more in the laboratory without differentiating, but most adult stem cells cannot; and 2) what are the factors in living organisms that normally regulate stem cell proliferation and self-renewal? Discovering the answers to these questions may make it possible to understand how cell proliferation is regulated during normal embryonic development or during the abnormal cell division that leads to cancer. Importantly, such information would enable scientists to grow embryonic and adult stem cells more efficiently in the laboratory. Up to Top Stem cells are unspecialized. One of the fundamental properties of a stem cell is that it does not have any tissue-specific structures that allow it to perform specialized functions. A stem cell cannot work with its neighbors to pump blood through the body (like a heart muscle cell); it cannot carry molecules of oxygen through the bloodstream (like a red blood cell); and it cannot fire electrochemical signals to other cells that allow the body to move or speak (like a nerve cell). However, unspecialized stem cells can give rise to specialized cells, including heart muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells. Stem cells are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods . Unlike muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells -- which do not normally replicate themselves -- stem cells may replicate many times. When cells replicate themselves many times over it is called proliferation. A starting population of stem cells that proliferates for many months in the laboratory can yield millions of cells. If the resulting cells continue to be unspecialized, like the parent stem cells, the cells are said to be capable of long-term self-renewal. The specific factors and conditions that allow stem cells to remain unspecialized are of great interest to scientists. It has taken scientists many years of trial and error to learn to grow stem cells in the laboratory without them spontaneously differentiating into specific cell types. For example, it took 20 years to learn how to grow human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory following the development of conditions for growing mouse stem cells. Therefore, an important area of research is understanding the signals in a mature organism that cause a stem cell population to proliferate and remain unspecialized until the cells are needed for repair of a specific tissue. Such information is critical for scientists to be able to grow large numbers of unspecialized stem cells in the laboratory for further experimentation. Stem cells can give rise to specialized cells . When unspecialized stem cells give rise to specialized cells, the process is called differentiation. Scientists are just beginning to understand the signals inside and outside cells that trigger stem cell differentiation. The internal signals are controlled by a cell's genes, which are interspersed across long strands of DNA, and carry coded instructions for all the structures and functions of a cell. The external signals for cell differentiation include chemicals secreted by other cells, physical contact with neighboring cells, and certain molecules in the microenvironment. Therefore, many questions about stem cell differentiation remain. For example, are the internal and external signals for cell differentiation similar for all kinds of stem cells? Can specific sets of signals be identified that promote differentiation into specific cell types? Addressing these questions is critical because the answers may lead scientists to find new ways of controlling stem cell differentiation in the laboratory, thereby growing cells or tissues that can be used for specific purposes including cell-based therapies. Adult stem cells typically generate the cell types of the tissue in which they reside. A blood-forming adult stem cell in the bone marrow, for example, normally gives rise to the many types of blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Until recently, it had been thought that a blood-forming cell in the bone marrow -- which is called a hematopoietic stem cell -- could not give rise to the cells of a very different tissue, such as nerve cells in the brain. However, a number of experiments over the last several years have raised the possibility that stem cells from one tissue may be able to give rise to cell types of a completely different tissue, a phenomenon known as plasticity. Examples of such plasticity include blood cells becoming neurons, liver cells that can be made to produce insulin, and hematopoietic stem cells that can develop into heart muscle. Therefore, exploring the possibility of using adult stem cells for cell-based therapies has become a very active area of investigation by researchers. Up to Top III. What are embryonic stem cells? A. What stages of early embryonic development are important for generating embryonic stem cells? Embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived from embryos. Specifically, embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs that have been fertilized in vitro -- in an in vitro fertilization clinic -- and then donated for research purposes with informed consent of the donors. They are not derived from eggs fertilized in a woman's body. The embryos from which human embryonic stem cells are derived are typically four or five days old and are a hollow microscopic ball of cells called the blastocyst. The blastocyst includes three structures: the trophoblast, which is the layer of cells that surrounds the blastocyst; the blastocoel, which is the hollow cavity inside the blastocyst; and the inner cell mass, which is a group of approximately 30 cells at one end of the blastocoel. B. How are embryonic stem cells grown in the laboratory? Growing cells in the laboratory is known as cell culture. Human embryonic stem cells are isolated by transferring the inner cell mass into a plastic laboratory culture dish that contains a nutrient broth known as culture medium. The cells divide and spread over the surface of the dish. The inner surface of the culture dish is typically coated with mouse embryonic skin cells that have been treated so they will not divide. This coating layer of cells is called a feeder layer. The reason for having the mouse cells in the bottom of the culture dish is to give the inner cell mass cells a sticky surface to which they can attach. Also, the feeder cells release nutrients into the culture medium. Recently, scientists have begun to devise ways of growing embryonic stem cells without the mouse feeder cells. This is a significant scientific advancement because of the risk that viruses or other macromolecules in the mouse cells may be transmitted to the human cells. Over the course of several days, the cells of the inner cell mass proliferate and begin to crowd the culture dish. When this occurs, they are removed gently and plated into several fresh culture dishes. The process of replating the cells is repeated many times and for many months, and is called subculturing. Each cycle of subculturing the cells is referred to as a passage. After six months or more, the original 30 cells of the inner cell mass yield millions of embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells that have proliferated in cell culture for six or more months without differentiating, are pluripotent, and appear genetically normal, are referred to as an embryonic stem cell line. Once cell lines are established, or even before that stage, batches of them can be frozen and shipped to other laboratories for further culture and experimentation. C. What laboratory tests are used to identify embryonic stem cells? At various points during the process of generating embryonic stem cell lines, scientists test the cells to see whether they exhibit the fundamental properties that make them embryonic stem cells. This process is called characterization. As yet, scientists who study human embryonic stem cells have not agreed on a standard battery of tests that measure the cells' fundamental properties. Also, scientists acknowledge that many of the tests they do use may not be good indicators of the cells' most important biological properties and functions. Nevertheless, laboratories that grow human embryonic stem cell lines use several kinds of tests. These tests include: growing and subculturing the stem cells for many months. This ensures that the cells are capable of long-term self-renewal. Scientists inspect the cultures through a microscope to see that the cells look healthy and remain undifferentiated. using specific techniques to determine the presence of surface markers that are found only on undifferentiated cells. Another important test is for the presence of a protein called Oct-4, which undifferentiated cells typically make. Oct-4 is a transcription factor, meaning that it helps turn genes on and off at the right time, which is an important part of the processes of cell differentiation   and embryonic development. examining the chromosomes under a microscope. This is a method to assess whether the chromosomes are damaged or if the number of chromosomes has changed. It does not detect genetic mutations in the cells. determining whether the cells can be subcultured after freezing, thawing, and replating. testing whether the human embryonic stem cells are pluripotent by 1) allowing the cells to differentiate spontaneously in cell culture; 2) manipulating the cells so they will differentiate to form specific cell types; or 3) injecting the cells into an immunosuppressed mouse to test for the formation of a benign tumor called a teratoma. Teratomas typically contain a mixture of many differentiated or partly differentiated cell types -- an indication that the embryonic stem cells are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types. D. How are embryonic stem cells stimulated to differentiate?  Figure 1. Directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Click here for larger image. As long as the embryonic stem cells in culture are grown under certain conditions, they can remain undifferentiated (unspecialized). But if cells are allowed to clump together to form embryoid bodies, they begin to differentiate spontaneously. They can form muscle cells, nerve cells, and many other cell types. Although spontaneous differentiation is a good indication that a culture of embryonic stem cells is healthy, it is not an efficient way to produce cultures of specific cell types. So, to generate cultures of specific types of differentiated cells -- heart muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells, for example -- scientists try to control the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. They change the chemical composition of the culture medium, alter the surface of the culture dish, or modify the cells by inserting specific genes. Through years of experimentation scientists have established some basic protocols or ""recipes"" for the directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into some specific cell types (Figure 1). (For more examples of directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells, see Chapters 5-9 and Appendices B and C of the NIH report ""Stem Cells: Scientific Progress and Future Research Directions"" go to http://stemcells.nih.gov/stemcell/scireport.asp) If scientists can reliably direct the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into specific cell types, they may be able to use the resulting, differentiated cells to treat certain diseases at some point in the future. Diseases that might be treated by transplanting cells generated from human embryonic stem cells include Parkinson's disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Purkinje cell degeneration, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, heart disease, and vision and hearing loss. Up to Top IV. What are adult stem cells? An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell found among differentiated cells in a tissue or organ, can renew itself, and can differentiate to yield the major specialized cell types of the tissue or organ. The primary roles of adult stem cells in a living organism are to maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found. Some scientists now use the term somatic stem cell instead of adult stem cell. Unlike embryonic stem cells, which are defined by their origin (the inner cell mass of the blastocyst), the origin of adult stem cells in mature tissues is unknown. Research on adult stem cells has recently generated a great deal of excitement. Scientists have found adult stem cells in many more tissues than they once thought possible. This finding has led scientists to ask whether adult stem cells could be used for transplants. In fact, adult blood forming stem cells from bone marrow have been used in transplants for 30 years. Certain kinds of adult stem cells seem to have the ability to differentiate into a number of different cell types, given the right conditions. If this differentiation of adult stem cells can be controlled in the laboratory, these cells may become the basis of therapies for many serious common diseases. The history of research on adult stem cells began about 40 years ago. In the 1960s, researchers discovered that the bone marrow contains at least two kinds of stem cells. One population, called hematopoietic stem cells, forms all the types of blood cells in the body. A second population, called bone   marrow stromal cells was discovered a few years later. Stromal cells are a mixed cell population that generates bone, cartilage, fat, and fibrous connective tissue. Also in the 1960s, scientists who were studying rats discovered two regions of the brain that contained dividing cells, which become nerve cells. Despite these reports, most scientists believed that new nerve cells could not be generated in the adult brain. It was not until the 1990s that scientists agreed that the adult brain does contain stem cells that are able to generate the brain's three major cell types -- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which are non-neuronal cells, and neurons or nerve cells. A. Where are adult stem cells found and what do they normally do? Adult stem cells have been identified in many organs and tissues. One important point to understand about adult stem cells is that there are a very small number of stem cells in each tissue. Stem cells are thought to reside in a specific area of each tissue where they may remain quiescent (non-dividing) for many years until they are activated by disease or tissue injury. The adult tissues reported to contain stem cells include brain, bone marrow, peripheral blood, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, skin and liver. Scientists in many laboratories are trying to find ways to grow adult stem cells in cell culture and manipulate them to generate specific cell types so they can be used to treat injury or disease. Some examples of potential treatments include replacing the dopamine-producing cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients, developing insulin-producing cells for type I diabetes and repairing damaged heart muscle following a heart attack with cardiac muscle cells. B. What tests are used for identifying adult stem cells? Scientists do not agree on the criteria that should be used to identify and test adult stem cells. However, they often use one or more of the following three methods: (1) labeling the cells in a living tissue with molecular markers and then determining the specialized cell types they generate; (2) removing the cells from a living animal, labeling them in cell culture, and transplanting them back into another animal to determine whether the cells repopulate their tissue of origin; and (3) isolating the cells, growing them in cell culture, and manipulating them, often by adding growth factors or introducing new genes, to determine what differentiated cells types they can become. Also, a single adult stem cell should be able to generate a line of genetically identical cells -- known as a clone -- which then gives rise to all the appropriate differentiated cell types of the tissue. Scientists tend to show either that a stem cell can give rise to a clone of cells in cell culture, or that a purified population of candidate stem cells can repopulate the tissue after transplant into an animal. Recently, by infecting adult stem cells with a virus that gives a unique identifier to each individual cell, scientists have been able to demonstrate that individual adult stem cell clones have the ability to repopulate injured tissues in a living animal. C. What is known about adult stem cell differentiation?  Figure 2. Hematopoietic and stromal stem cell differentiation. Click here for larger image. As indicated above, scientists have reported that adult stem cells occur in many tissues and that they enter normal differentiation pathways to form the specialized cell types of the tissue in which they reside. Adult stem cells may also exhibit the ability to form specialized cell types of other tissues, which is known as transdifferentiation or plasticity. Normal differentiation pathways of adult stem cells. In a living animal, adult stem cells can divide for a long period and can give rise to mature cell types that have characteristic shapes and specialized structures and functions of a particular tissue. The following are examples of differentiation pathways of adult stem cells (Figure 2). Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all the types of blood cells: red blood cells, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets. Bone marrow stromal cells (mesenchymal stem cells) give rise to a variety of cell types: bone cells (osteocytes), cartilage cells (chondrocytes), fat cells (adipocytes), and other kinds of connective tissue cells such as those in tendons. Neural stem cells in the brain give rise to its three major cell types: nerve cells (neurons) and two categories of non-neuronal cells -- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Epithelial stem cells in the lining of the digestive tract occur in deep crypts and give rise to several cell types: absorptive cells, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Skin stem cells occur in the basal layer of the epidermis and at the base of hair follicles. The epidermal stem cells give rise to keratinocytes, which migrate to the surface of the skin and form a protective layer. The follicular stem cells can give rise to both the hair follicle and to the epidermis. Adult stem cell plasticity and transdifferentiation. A number of experiments have suggested that certain adult stem cell types are pluripotent. This ability to differentiate into multiple cell types is called plasticity or transdifferentiation. The following list offers examples of adult stem cell plasticity that have been reported during the past few years. Hematopoietic stem cells may differentiate into: three major types of brain cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes); skeletal muscle cells; cardiac muscle cells; and liver cells. Bone marrow stromal cells may differentiate into: cardiac muscle cells and skeletal muscle cells. Brain stem cells may differentiate into: blood cells and skeletal muscle cells. Current research is aimed at determining the mechanisms that underlie adult stem cell plasticity. If such mechanisms can be identified and controlled, existing stem cells from a healthy tissue might be induced to repopulate and repair a diseased tissue (Figure 3). D. What are the key questions about adult stem cells? Many important questions about adult stem cells remain to be answered. They include:   How many kinds of adult stem cells exist, and in which tissues do they exist? What are the sources of adult stem cells in the body? Are they ""leftover"" embryonic stem cells, or do they arise in some other way? Why do they remain in an undifferentiated state when all the cells around them have differentiated? Do adult stem cells normally exhibit plasticity, or do they only transdifferentiate when scientists manipulate them experimentally? What are the signals that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells that demonstrate plasticity? Is it possible to manipulate adult stem cells to enhance their proliferation so that sufficient tissue for transplants can be produced? Does a single type of stem cell exist -- possibly in the bone marrow or circulating in the blood -- that can generate the cells of any organ or tissue? What are the factors that stimulate stem cells to relocate to sites of injury or damage?  Figure 3. Plasticity of adult stem cells. Click here for larger image. Up to Top V. What are the similarities and differences between embryonic and adult stem cells? Human embryonic and adult stem cells each have advantages and disadvantages regarding potential use for cell-based regenerative therapies. Of course, adult and embryonic stem cells differ in the number and type of differentiated cells types they can become. Embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body because they are pluripotent. Adult stem cells are generally limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. However, some evidence suggests that adult stem cell plasticity may exist, increasing the number of cell types a given adult stem cell can become. Large numbers of embryonic stem cells can be relatively easily grown in culture, while adult stem cells are rare in mature tissues and methods for expanding their numbers in cell culture have not yet been worked out. This is an important distinction, as large numbers of cells are needed for stem cell replacement therapies. A potential advantage of using stem cells from an adult is that the patient's own cells could be expanded in culture and then reintroduced into the patient. The use of the patient's own adult stem cells would mean that the cells would not be rejected by the immune system. This represents a significant advantage as immune rejection is a difficult problem that can only be circumvented with immunosuppressive drugs. Embryonic stem cells from a donor introduced into a patient could cause transplant rejection. However, whether the recipient would reject donor embryonic stem cells has not been determined in human experiments. Up to Top VI. What are the potential uses of human stem cells and the obstacles that must be overcome before these potential uses will be realized? There are many ways in which human stem cells can be used in basic research and in clinical research. However, there are many technical hurdles between the promise of stem cells and the realization of these uses, which will only be overcome by continued intensive stem cell research. Studies of human embryonic stem cells may yield information about the complex events that occur during human development. A primary goal of this work is to identify how undifferentiated stem cells become differentiated. Scientists know that turning genes on and off is central to this process. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to abnormal cell division and differentiation. A better understanding of the genetic and molecular controls of these processes may yield information about how such diseases arise and suggest new strategies for therapy. A significant hurdle to this use and most uses of stem cells is that scientists do not yet fully understand the signals that turn specific genes on and off to influence the differentiation of the stem cell. Human stem cells could also be used to test new drugs. For example, new medications could be tested for safety on differentiated cells generated from human pluripotent cell lines. Other kinds of cell lines are already used in this way. Cancer cell lines, for example, are used to screen potential anti-tumor drugs. But, the availability of pluripotent stem cells would allow drug testing in a wider range of cell types. However, to screen drugs effectively, the conditions must be identical when comparing different drugs. Therefore, scientists will have to be able to precisely control the differentiation of stem cells into the specific cell type on which drugs will be tested. Current knowledge of the signals controlling differentiation fall well short of being able to mimic these conditions precisely to consistently have identical differentiated cells for each drug being tested. Perhaps the most important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues   that could be used for cell-based therapies. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used to replace ailing or destroyed tissue, but the need for transplantable tissues and organs far outweighs the available supply. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues to treat diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Figure 4. Heart muscle repair with adult stem cells. Click here for larger image. For example, it may become possible to generate healthy heart muscle cells in the laboratory and then transplant those cells into patients with chronic heart disease. Preliminary research in mice and other animals indicates that bone marrow stem cells, transplanted into a damaged heart, can generate heart muscle cells and successfully repopulate the heart tissue. Other recent studies in cell culture systems indicate that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of embryonic stem cells or adult bone marrow cells into heart muscle cells (Figure 4). In people who suffer from type I diabetes, the cells of the pancreas that normally produce insulin are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. New studies indicate that it may be possible to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells in cell culture to form insulin-producing cells that eventually could be used in transplantation therapy for diabetics. To realize the promise of novel cell-based therapies for such pervasive and debilitating diseases, scientists must be able to easily and reproducibly manipulate stem cells so that they possess the necessary characteristics for successful differentiation, transplantation and engraftment. The following is a list of steps in successful cell-based treatments that scientists will have to learn to precisely control to bring such treatments to the clinic. To be useful for transplant purposes, stem cells must be reproducibly made to: Proliferate extensively and generate sufficient quantities of tissue. Differentiate into the desired cell type(s). Survive in the recipient after transplant. Integrate into the surrounding tissue after transplant. Function appropriately for the duration of the recipient's life. Avoid harming the recipient in any way. Also, to avoid the problem of immune rejection, scientists are experimenting with different research strategies to generate tissues that will not be rejected. To summarize, the promise of stem cell therapies is an exciting one, but significant technical hurdles remain that will only be overcome through years of intensive research. The NIH has a wide array of new scientific programs designed to support research that uses embryonic stem cell lines. VII. Where can I get more information?

GX253-57-11200634	Use of Human Embryonic Stem Cells In NIH Supported Intramural and Extramural Research On August 9, 2001, at 9:00 p.m. EDT, the President announced his decision to allow Federal funds to be used for research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines as long as prior to his announcement (1) the derivation process (which commences with the removal of the inner cell mass from the blastocyst) had already been initiated and (2) the embryo from which the stem cell line was derived no longer had the possibility of development as a human being. In addition, the President established the following criteria that must be met: - The stem cells must have been derived from an embryo that was created for reproductive purposes; - The embryo was no longer needed for these purposes; - Informed consent must have been obtained for the donation of the embryo; - No financial inducements were provided for donation of the embryo. In order to facilitate research using human embryonic stem cells, the NIH is creating a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry that will list the human embryonic stem cell lines -- at varying stages of development -- that meet the eligibility criteria. Entities that have developed stem cell lines that meet the President's criteria and are therefore eligible for federal funding are listed at the following location: http://escr.nih.gov.

The Working Group supported this research area and proposed an embryonic stem cell data workshop to standardize data collection and facilitate data comparisons among laboratories. A greater  -2-   availability of human embryonic stem cell lines to the scientific community was seen as essential. The W orking Group saw the need f or Institute-sponsored stem cell research centers, such as the Specialized Centers of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCORs) to encourage collaborative teams with multi-disciplinary basic and clinical investigators, including an assessment of stem cell delivery and safety. The Working Group also recommended utilization of genomic and proteomic techniques to characterize the progression from a stem cell to adult cell types. A number of resource needs, including stem cell banks and animal models to establish treatment eff icacy, were also identified.  -3-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR REGENERATIVE & RE PARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Background Recent discoveries provide new and unprecedented opportunities for the therapeutic use of stem, progenitor, and differentiated cells for new treatments of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. In August 2001 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) formed the Cell-based Therapy Group in order to address stem cell and cell-based therapy issues, to track human embryonic stem cell applications and grants, and to formulate a strategic plan for the development of a research program leading to new cell-based therapies. The Cell-based Therapy Group is formulating an Institute-wide implementation plan integrating basic and translational research programs to support the development of new cellular therapies. Potential cell-based therapies could involve a variety of cell sources. Bone marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood stem cells have been used to treat serious blood disorders, malignant disease, and inherited diseases. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cells but may also differentiate into other cell lineages. For example, the capacity of bone marrow derived cells to engraft as alveolar type 1 epithelial cells and as bronchial epithelial cells has been demonstrated. Bone marrow and cord blood are also being used as a source of endothelial progenitor cells for exploratory treatments for cardiac and limb ischemia. Mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow have been demonstrated to differentiate into a variety of non-hematopoietic tissues including bone, cartilage, tendon, fat, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and early progenitors of neural cells. Interesting preliminary data suggests mesenchymal stem cells may promote hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and foster tolerance and facilitate transplantation of heart, lung, or blood tissues from unrelated donors. Adult bone marrow cells have been reported as a source of cells for repairing various tissues, including blood vessels, heart muscle, skeletal muscle and nervous tissue. A novel multipotent adult progenitor cell isolated from bone marrow is reported to differentiate into cells associated with all three germ cell layers and the potential of these cells is just beginning to be explored. Adult skeletal muscle cells are being utilized and cultured as a potential cell source for cellular cardiomyoplasty for the treatment of heart disease. In addition, it has been speculated and there is pre liminary eviden ce that cardiovasc ular and lung tissue s may conta in one o r more progenitor or stem cells that could be induced to proliferate and repair cellular damage. The National Institutes of Health is implementing a policy permitting federal funding of research using human embryonic stem cell lines from a registry of cell lines that meet the eligibility criteria. Embryon ic stem cells can d iff erentia te into ce lls associate d with all three germ cell layers and have been sho wn to form cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic cells. The best source of cells and their potential for cell-based therapy is a key research question. In order to plan for a working group for 2002, the Cell-based Therapy group convened a sixmember teleconference on October 15, 2001. The six panel members were: 1) Dr. Ray C.J. Chiu in Division at Cardiothoracic Surgery at McGill University; 2) Dr. Cynthia Dunbar in the Hematology Branch at National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; 3) Dr. Loren Field in the  -4-   Department of Medicine at Indiana University; 4) Dr. Margaret Goodell in the Department of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine; 5) Dr. Saul Sharkis in the Experimental Hematology Program at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center; and 6) Dr. David Warburton in the Department of Developmental Biology at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. They provided perspectives for developing a program in cellular therapies that assisted the Cell-based Therapy Group in formulating a framework for a working group to be convened in 2002. The panel also provided names of scientific experts, outlined roadblocks and priorities to be addressed, and cited resources missing from current programs. Using this information, the Cell-based Therapy group outlined the agenda and convened a working group May 1-2, 2002 to define the state-of-the-art on cell-based therapies, discuss the implications of that knowledge for research and medicine, and identify opportunities and obstacles to successfully exploiting cell-based therapies for repairing or replacing damaged, diseased, or defective tissue with new, functional tissue. The meeting organizers included Mary Anne Berberich from the Division of Lung Diseases, Chris Kelley and John Fakunding from the Division of Heart and Vascular Diseases, and John Thomas from the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources. The twenty-four scientific experts listed below were scheduled to participate in the working group, however, the meeting chair, Dr. Helen Blau, and the one session chair, Dr. Anthony Atalia, were not able to attend du e to illness. The meeting was organized into four sessions: 1) Tools, Technologies and other Resources; 2) Basic Science Knowledge; 3) Clinical Applications; and 4) Master Plan: Vision, Scope and Direction. The entire agenda is included in the Appendix.                       Antho ny J. Atala Barbara E. Bierer Helen Blau Ray C. J. Chiu Ronald Crystal Francesco J. DeMayo Cynthia Du nbar Jonat han A.

Stem cells must undergo tissue-specific differentiation either prior to transpla ntatio n or in vivo and be expandable to the scale required for clinical application. Safety considerations are paramount, including a lack of tumor formation and an inability for germ line transmission. The advantages of embryonic stem cells as a cell source, include virtually indefinite growth and differentiation potential that encompasses all cells and tissues. Specific differentiation in vitro into cells with th e phen otypic cha racteristics of cardiomyocyt es, neu ral cells, insulin produc ing bet a cells, and hemato poietic ce lls has bee n demon strated . However, emb ryonic stem cells give rise to teratomas, suggesting the need for complete stem cell differentiation or the removal of any remaining undifferentiated embryonic stem cells from a graft. If human embryonic cell lines are used, they would be allogeneic to potential recipients. The generation of auto logous embryonic stem cells would require nuclear transfer techniques. An alternate cell source is somatic stem cells. These so-called ""adult"" stem cells could be derived from specific tissues including hematopoietic, mesenchymal, neuronal, and endothelial stem cells and possibly ste m cells from the heart, lun g and live r. If tissue-spe cific stem ce lls have the ability to acquire the fate of cell types different from the tissue of origin, termed ""stem cell plasticity,"" this will further expand th e utility of somatic stem cells for cellular therapy. To date mo st demon strations of ste m cell plasticity invo lve only a f raction of 1 percen t of th e cells in a tissue. For clinical application plasticity must be rigorously demonstrated to include a robust, persistent engraftment resulting in functional improvement.  Models and Functional Assessment Discussion Panel: Field, Fine, Chiu, Keating, Whitsett The development of models for functional assessment of cell-based therapies requires accurate stem cell tracking, evaluation of the stem cell differentiation, and the selection of physiologic endpoints or surrogate markers for assessing impact on function. Cell tracking or cell diff erentia tion f ate map ping ha s used ge netic markers, such as Y or X chromo some markers or enzyme polymorph isms. The inhe rent error rate of th ese tech nique s is problemat ic when the cell frequency is low. An alternate method, transgene markers, are more difficult to use clinically and this method cannot be applied to banked samples. Metabolic tags such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling can be useful for cell transplantation studies but the  -7-   results are subjective and sensitivity may be an issue if the transplanted cells proliferate. The assessment of dif ferentiation or trans-diff erentiation events can use en dogenou s phenotypic markers, but multiple markers are needed to increase reliability. Lineage restricted reporter genes can provide an unambiguous assay if designed and performed correctly, but they are more difficult to use clinically and this method cannot be applied to banked samples. In more complex systems ""nonspecific"" complications may arise, such as transgene methylation. Assessment of the physiologic consequences of the process requires consideration of the mechanism for the physiologic endpoint. A cell-based therapy could result in the development of functional new cells. Alternatively, the therapy could increase growth of a nearby tissue, increase tissue circulation, have a positive effect on connective tissue remodeling, or alter infla mmatory or immune response s. That is, the cellular thera py may result in a direct cellspecific effect or may result in an indirect effect. Therapy may improve function over time or attenuate a decreasing physiological function. The pursuit of new cell-based therapies requires d emonstra tion of long-term ef ficacy in a longitu dinal stu dy, not merely single time point measurements.  -8-   Session II: Basic Science Knowledge Lessons from Developmental Biology for Cell-based Therapy Discussion panel: Warburton, Hogan, DeMayo, Epstein, O'Reilly, Whittset The disciplines of developmental biology and stem cell biology are closely linked. Issues at the core of developmental biology research are reemerging as important subjects relevant to therapeutic interventions utilizing stem cells. Recent discoveries in organ morphogenesis and stem cell-based organ regeneration support a cautious optimism about their successful application to heart, lung and blood disease. However, useful information about the possibilities for exploitation of human genome programs governing organogenesis, and by analogy, regeneration by stem cells, is as yet rudimentary. Therefore, the successful application of cell-based therapies to disease conditions is realistically limited by insufficient basic science knowledge of fundamental processes. Studies in flies and mice have identified only a few of the key genes that determine organogenesis. More basic research is required to comprehend the full repertoire of genomic and proteomic interactions that determine organspecific form and function. Because much of the specificity is derived from temporo-spatial interaction between signals of mesodermal, endodermal or ectodermal origin, knowledge of these interactions is a necessary prerequisite to devising rational cell therapies for repair or regeneration. Central to any discussion of cell-based therapies is the need for some agreement on the def inition of a ""stem cell"" and how it dif fers f rom a ""proge nitor cell."" A stem ce ll is a relatively undifferentiated cell that has the capacity for sustained self-renewal, often throughout the lifetime of an animal, as well as the potential to give rise to differentiated progeny. A multipotent ""stem cell"" can self renew and give rise to several different mature cell types. In the lung, a multipotent stem cell might give rise to ciliated cells, clara cells, alveolar type II cells, and other cell types. Due to complexity of structure, the lung, like the heart, may lack tissuespecific stem cells. A progenitor cell usually belongs to a transitory amplifying population of cells derived from a ste m cell. It does not have th e capa city for su stained , undif fere ntiate d self renewal. Unfo rtunate ly, studies on stem cell bio logy in the lung are n owhere n ear as ad vanced as in other endoderm-derived organs such as the intestine and pancreas. However, an investment in basic ste m cell biology, along with continu ed prog ress in lung e mbryology, should a lter this disparity. A major need has been identified as a ""molecular lung anatomy project"". The goal of this project would be to describe the lineages of all the different cell types in the lung and to identify the nature and function of genes and proteins expressed in them. This could be achieved by introducing ""tags"" or ""reporters"" into specific kinds of epithelial or mesenchymal cells and following their fate in embryonic lung, in normal adult lung, and in lung undergoing reparative growth. This approach is very versatile; marked cell populations could be isolated and their gene expression profiles determined, or the effect of changes in specific genes on cell behavior could be followed in vivo. This approach would generate searchable, annotated, internet accessible databases of expressed genes that can be compared to similar databases gene rated f rom stem and progen itor cells fro m other tissu es, fo r instance , the he matopo ietic system, maintained by Dr. Ihor Lemishka at Princeton.  -9-   Preliminary proof of the principle that several possibilities for tissue regeneration exist has been obtained for cardiac regeneration, either from resident stem cells and from homing of bone marrow or body f at-derived stem cells. Howeve r, the biolo gy of both resid ent ste m cells and tissue specific stem cell homing remains obscure. Specificity of homing mechanisms for bone marrow, fat or mesenchymal stem cells to specific tissues is a high priority pursuit and should be explored. The development of suitable gene markers to be able to identify stem cells and to follow their fate in vivo would represent a major advance and would accelerate discovery in therapeutic applications. An important lesson from developmental biology relevant to this po tentia l is that the re are altern ative emb ryological o rigins of mature cardiova scular structu re. For example , recent st udies ind icate tha t there a re at least two early heart fields with cells capable of ultimately contributing to the myocardium. Likewise, both lateral plate mesoderm and neural crest cells are able to differentiate into smooth muscle, yet the respective progenitor cells are quite different. As in the lung, with its diverse assortment of cell types, it remains unclear if the intra- and extra-cellular signaling pathways that trigger terminal dif fere ntiation of th ese un related progen itors are iden tical or relate d. For stem cells derived from adult or embryonic tissue, the growth factor and signaling pathways governing the process of appropriate differentiation may not be conserved. Each cell type will need to be investigated in detail and premature extrapolation from one to the other should be avoided. Studies on the basic biology of stem cells are needed. Areas to emphasize include: 1. Develop RNA and protein expression profiles, cell-surface markers and/or monoclonal antibodies to define the stages of progression from a stem cell to a functional diff erentia ted cell. (This may lack the `hyp othes is driven' labe l becaus e of its inheren tly descriptive nature but it is a fundamental requirement for success.) 2. Provide evidence for the existence of a stem cell in the lung. Determine how many different kinds of stem cells are present, i.e., one for each type of cell present. 3. Characterize the stem cell markers. Determine how robust they are and whether they can be used to sort out the stem cells. 4. Determine whether they respond to signals and whether these signals can be manipulated to promote proliferation of stem cells after injury. 5. Determine and characterize the cytoplasmic, nuclear and genetic factors regulating stem cell phenotypes. 6. Continue studies of basic mechanisms of tissue and organ patterning and regeneration. 7. Develop small and large animal models of cell-based therapies with appropriate delivery devices and in vivo imaging capabilities. 8. The ""molecular lung anatomy project,"" using cre-lox technology for tagging presumptive stem cells and follow th eir course in lun g deve lopment in transge nic mice, is equ ally applicable to heart and would provide for sharing of these mouse stem cell models and the data base of gene function and lineage specification generated from them. Immune Aspects of Cell-based Therapy Discussion p anel: De Mayo, Matzinger, O'Re illy One of the goals of investigating the role of the immune system in cell-based therapies is to understand how the immune system regulates cell function, circulating stem cell and progenitor cell repair, an d transp lantat ion. This inclu des ho w the immune system regu lates pu lmonary epithe lial cell fun ction, ho w the pulmo nary tissue regulate s the activit y of th e immune syst em in  -10-   the lung and how circulating stem cells may contribute to pulmonary cell repair in this milieu. Critical elements that control proliferation versus differentiation choices of resident heart, lung, blood stem cells are only beginning to be understood. This information is of paramount importance in keeping stem cell therapy under control. The use of animal models where gene expressio n and a blation can be co ntrolled in a regulat ed f ashion , in combina tion with ge nomic approaches will allow the development of such therapies. Further development and characterization of animal models mirroring human disease, for example, storage diseases, could be used to define the potential therapeutic effects of stem cell therapies at different stages of development. The basic science of physiologic and immunologic barriers to stem cell transplantation must also be defined. It will be important to determine whether cell-based therapies will enjoy immune tolerance and, if not, to develop an immune-tolerant universal donor pool of stem cells. An evaluation of the immunogenicity of embryonic stem cells and adult mult i-poten tial stem cells comp ared to h ematop oietic stem ce lls, diff erentia ted cells in organ allografts, and dendritic cells could reveal whether embryonic stem cells have alternative mechanisms for inhibiting or evading alloresponsive T cells, such as those operating in the developing fetus. All this would be facilitated by establishing a gene activation registry of appropriate transgenic mouse model constructs. Development of better imaging techniques would assist in the characterization of phenotypes. Stem cell transfer likely involves definition of critical pairings of cell types essential to lineage specific stem cell differentiation. The influence of established, specialized cell niches permissive to in vivo development, organ specific differentiation and functional integration must be explored. It is critical to bear in mind that immed iate clinical tra nslation will likely be impossible o r dange rous withou t more basic knowledge of the fundamental processes involved in the immune aspects of cell-based therapy and regenerative medicine.  -11-   Session III: Clinical Applications In considering clinical applications for cell-based therapies, we need to reflect on lessons learned from the experience with gene therapy. First and foremost will be adequate characte rization of cell prepara tions tha t are to be utilized f or cell-based therapie s. It is necessary that adequate characterization of cells has taken place to be able to understand and follow the f ate of cells. In terms of control issues, there is concern that utilizing cells, particularly stem cells, may have unintended consequences, such as the development of malignancies or teratomas. In addition, with therapies utilizing cells, there is the possibility that too many cells will be introduced, that the wrong cell type will be utilized or incorporated, or that cells will either end up in the wrong place within the target tissue or organ or be distributed outside of the intended target with a possible adverse conseq uence. There may be instances, such as th ese, whe re it may not b e bene ficial to have th e cell-base d therap y continu e or there may be a need for a means of cellular control. In this instance, there may be a consideration of utilizing suicide genes or other similar strategies to halt or limit the cell-based therapy. Stem cell products have long been used and manipulated in various ways largely focused on deple ting sub sets of accompa nying immun e cells. Howeve r, the bu rgeonin g field of ste m cell biology h as posite d the ste m cell as a resou rce for reg enerat ing multiple cell types if manipulated properly ex vivo. Such manipulations involve complex culturing systems and a sophisticated understanding of the basic biology of the cells coupled to bioengineering expertise. In addition, recent advances with in vivo selection systems for genetically modified stem cells have raised the possibility of using in vivo selection to artif icially amplify g enetica lly modified cells in diseases (e.g., sickle cell disease, Cooley's anemia) where a therapeutic gene alone is expected to confer little growth or survival advantage. There is a clear need for facilities where basic investigators can transform validated hypotheses into clinical applications. Some of the preclinical tasks of a cell processing facility include the qualification and testing of reagents, scale-up of methods, high-end cell selection and culturing, development of standard operating procedures, ongoing process validation, and the provision of controlled good manufacturing practice (GMP) infrastructure. An add itional con sideratio n is the ne ed f or controlle d studie s to monito r the delive ry of cells and the use of appropriate controls. Is the effect of a cell-based therapy the result of the use of a specific stem cell or are similar results obtained using control cells that would not be expected to produce the same results. For example, in cell transplantation studies in the heart, th e injection of ske letal muscle ce lls have be en repo rted to impro ve fu nction. However, the question remains, would cardiac function also be improved using non-muscle cells such as fibroblasts or hepatocytes? Once the science has developed to the point of initiating clinical studies in cell-based therapies, there will be special concerns for patient safety and data integrity. Current regulation, policies and procedures in place for data and safety monitoring should suffice for clinical studies and trials of cell-based therapies. However, there may be a need for implementing the types of stringent controls on human subject research that apply to gene therapy protocols. Disease Candidates for Cell-Based Therapies  -12-   Discussion Panel: Drs. Dunbar, Fine, Crystal, Keating, and Quertermous The capacity of bone marrow derived cells to serve as precursors to differentiated cells of various organs has challenged long held views regarding the potential origin of somatic stem cells and the fixed nature of stem cell potential. Indeed, recent studies indicate that postnatal stem cells can give rise to tissue structures previously held to originate from only one of the different embryonic cell layers. In the mouse lung, collagen producing interstitial cells, and epithe lial cells of th e airway and alveolus h ave be en sho wn to arise f rom marrow cell precursors after bone marrow transplantation or direct systemic injection. The relevance of these observations to normal organ function and the pathogenesis of disease remains uncertain. Regardless, these observations have sug gested a therape utic strategy in which marrow cells are employed as an alternative source of progenitor cells for the replacement of specific cell types damaged or lost during the course of disease. The relative ease of obtaining and purifying marrow cells makes this an attractive option. Clinically, cell-based therapies may consist of cell transplantation strategies, cell mobilization and regeneration, or tissue engineering for replacement tissues and organs. In terms of therapeutic candidate s for cell-based therapies, there are a number of possibilities. These include new bone marrow reconstitution strategies and possible nuclear transfer for autologous stem cell gene therapies for blood diseases such as sickle cell disease and hemoglobinopath ies. In addition, cell-based therapies could be employed to establish hematopoietic chimerism to induce transplant tolerance. In terms of cardiovascular disease, cell-based therapies offer the potential to correct myocardial sinus and pacemaker dysfunction, and potentially to treat rhythm disturbances. Cell-based therapies could be utilized to treat conge stive hea rt failure , either th rough in creases in th e fu nctiona l capacity o f the heart muscles or through replacement or repair of damaged or defective tissue. Cell-based therapy could be utilized to re pair the h eart soo n af ter a hea rt attack, a s a preven tive measu re to limit cardiac problems, such as the development of heart failure. Cell therapy for vascular bed could prevent heart attacks by targeting an d repairing atherosclerotic vessels or be used as a means of stimulating new blood vessel formation and blood flow to the ischemic heart through the stimulation of angiog enesis. The uniq ue prop erties of the lung provide inh erent ob stacles, b ut also op portun ities fo r a cellbased therapy strategy for diseases of this organ. One major obstacle is the slow turnover of lung cells. As a result, lung engraftment may require prior treatments to create ""space"" for exoge nously a dministered cells. It is notable that th e growing lung ha s height ened cell turnover, and thus, may be a more amenable therapeutic target than its adult counterpart. Another limitation is conceptual: a more complete understanding of the factors and cues that control lun g cell dif fere ntiation would provid e addit ional too ls for a ce ll-based th erapeu tic strategy. The multitude of cell types that comprise the intact lung contribute to the complexity of this issue. Defining marrow cell subtypes that have the capacity to differentiate into particular lung cell lineages is another key issue. The app ropriate h oming an d insertion of ex ogen ously de livered precu rsor cells to spe cific parenchyma sites require migration through vessel walls, basement membranes, and the extracellular space. Organ injury may improve engraftment efficiency, in part, by breaching the integrity of anatomical barriers, and by causing release of local inflammatory chemoattractant  -13-   substances. Hence, migration of marrow cells into an acutely injured heart or lung will likely be facilitated. Indeed, distal injury to lung or heart appears to significantly enhance homing, engraftment and differentiation of marrow cells into alveolar T1 or myocardial cells in mice. The unique anatomical configuration of the lung, however, suggests the possibility of direct airway delivery in con ditions th at are no t associat ed with sign ifican t infla mmation or alt eration s in barrier function. Moreover, the lung has a very extensive capillary network and receives the entire card iac outp ut. Thus, the ove rall delivery of cells to the lung may no t be limiting. Ra ther, targeting and migration into specific micro-anatomical compartments is likely to be a formidable limitation. These init ial observa tions, de rived fro m highly rarif ied systems, are intriguin g but will requ ire novel approaches to ascertain the ir true physiological significance. As a treatment strategy, cell-based therapy holds gre at promise f or reconst ituting d amage d tissue. Further, this approach may provide an alternative strategy for gene delivery. However, progress to this end will depend on: 1) the identification of cell types that require replacement in specific disease states; 2) a clearer understanding of the engraftment process; 3) and the identification of fact ors and co ndition s that au gment a nd con trol engra ftmen t. Ultimately, the eff icacy of cellbased therapies for lung and cardiac diseases will need to based on improved physiological function. Significantly more information regarding the fundamental biology of stem cells is required before rational therapies can be implemented. In this regard, early years of support may be directed at specified topics, including ""stem cell niche"" biology and better identification of precursor cell types that have trans-differentiation potential. Further, the development of certain key technologies would propel the field forward. A focus on new non-invasive methods of tracking cells into organs would be particularly useful. Once it becomes clear whether autolo gous o f allog eneic so urces of precursor cells a re adeq uate a nd nec essary f or cell therapies, a better understanding of transplantation immunology as it applies to stem cells may be required. It seems most reasonable that only after the biology of stem cells is better characterized that true translational research be supported. Moving forward with clinical protocols too early may in fact set the field back, as has occurred in the area of gene therapy. Regardless, there was a sense that certain target diseases should be identified. Severe congestive heart failure and end-stage emphysema were both th ought to be reason able starting points. Cell-based Approaches to Drug Development, Testing, Delivery Discussion Panel: Field, Fine, Chiu, Keating, and Whitsett The routine availability of human cell types and tissues would have a dramatic impact on the drug discovery process. To date, most human primary cell types are available in only restricted quantities from biopsy, donation, or autopsy tissues, and have limited functional and life span in culture. In more limited supp ly are a variety o f primary cell typ es from in dividuals with welldefined disease susceptibilities or genetic backgrounds. This paucity of human cells and tissue samples complicates the discovery of drugs to treat human disease and restricts thorough preclinical efficacy and safety profiling.  -14-   For the drug discovery process today, either biochemical or cell-based assays are used to screen f or lead dru g cand idates. In most cases, th e cells used during scree ning are immortalized cell lines that in some instances have been engineered to express a target molecule or reporter system. These cells are plated in multi-well formats and used to screen a few co mpoun ds to f ull libraries of chemical en tities. Fresh t issue or primary ce lls are gene rally only used in confirmatory studies when and if it is available. For drug metabolism and toxicity testing, candidate drugs are usually tested on immortalized cell lines representing gut epithelium, renal tubular epithelium, liver and other tissues representing target and non-target organs. In many of these cell lines, especially ""hepatocyte"" cell lines, many of the phenotypic and metabolic activities observed in the primary adult tissue are not ma intaine d in tissue cu lture limiting th e true pre dictive valu e of these te sts. As a resu lt it is often difficult to get an accurate early indication of the potential toxicity of a lead compound without elaborate animal and even human clinical studies. A renewa ble source of ce lls represent ing norma l and dise ased tissu e compon ents wou ld greatly facilitate target validation, drug screening, and drug metabolism and toxicity testing of drug can didate s. Diff erentia ting stem ce ll popula tions, es pecially plu ripoten t human embryonic stem cells, could fulfill this need. Embryonic cells have been derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst and will divide essentially indefinitely in vitro. Under appropriate cues, these cells will differentiate into representatives of all three germ lineages of the embryo, namely the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. To date, researchers have demonstrated the differentiation of neurons, cardiomyocytes, endothelial, hematopoietic, hepatocyte-like, and insulin-producing cells from human embryonic stem cells. Efforts are now underway in an increasing number of laboratories to define conditions which will direct differentiation to particular lineages and to use these derivatives to model and construct complex tissues. Differentiated cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, whether as purified or mixed populations of cells, should facilitate the functionalization and validation of drug targets along with the identification of candidate drugs. For instance, development of mixtures of neural components from stem cell populations could facilitate study of synapse formation, function, and degen eration, and lead to discovery of n ew molecules to treat neurodegene rative diseases. Combinations of neural and muscle cells could be used to investigate processes active at neuromuscular junctions with the consequent development of new therapeutics for movemen t disorders a nd disea ses. The ro utine a vailability of cardiomyocyt es could permit direct screening for drugs that will maintain or improve cardiac muscle contractility and prevent apoptosis or remodeling after ischemic episodes. Development of stem cell lines containing gene tic predispo sitions to d isease co uld be u sed to d erive targe t cells that co uld be u sed in basic research and in screening activities. Human embryonic stem cell derivatives could also facilitate the introduction of drug metabolism and toxicity testing earlier in the drug discovery process. Use of such cells could allow the earlier detection of potentially ineffective or toxic drug candidates before even animal or human testing. The establishment of embryonic cell lines representing multiple haplotypes which could subsequently be differentiated for hepatocytes, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and other cell types for drug metabolism and toxicity testing could facilitate the determination of the potential benefits and safety issues amongst different patient populations. The continuous  -15-   availability of such human cells would facilitate creation of information databases on the performance and safety of compounds, providing a reference standard for comparison for new drug candidates. In all of th e abov e applica tions, th e stem cell-de rived dif fere ntiate d cells could be used directly in the same assays tha t are used routinely to day in the drug disco very process . This techn ology wou ld compleme nt othe r techno logies th at are alrea dy availab le or are in development to monitor gene a nd protein changes in cells. The succe ssfu l isolation o f hu man stem ce lls from adu lt, fet al and e mbryonic sou rces of fers the promise for developing an array of novel therapeutics. Biologic therapies comprised of stem cells are expected to be effective in treating a wide variety of medical conditions through tissue reg enerat ion and repair as well as th e target ed delive ry of ge netic mate rial. Stem cellbased therapie s represen t a complex b iological e ntity. Followin g transp lantat ion, stem ce lls interact intimately with, and are influenced by the physiology of the recipient. Prior to patient administration cultured human stem cells are maintained under conditions that promote either the self-renewing expansion of undifferentiated progenitors or the acquisition of differentiated properties that are indicative of the phenotype the cells will assume. Once transplanted, incompletely differentiated populations of stem cells are impacted by additional fine-tuning that occurs as a consequence of instructions received from the microenvironment of the surrounding milieu encountered within the recipient. The intrinsic capacities for self-renewal and differentiation point simultaneously to the perceived therapeutic potential for stem cells, as well as, the challenge of assessing their safety from a regulatory perspective. Regardless of the sou rce of d erivation , assessin g human stem cell saf ety throu gh clinical inve stigation will require implementation of a comprehensive strategy. Each checkpoint in the process of developing a therapeutic product comprised of human stem cells beginning with identification and evaluation of suitable sources will require careful scrutiny. Included in a global assessmen t are the derivation , expan sion, man ipulation , and ch aracteriza tion hu man stem ce ll lines, as well as preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing in appropriate animal models. Being able to trace back from the cellular preparation for transplantation to the source of the founder stem cell population is critical as this allows each safety checkpoint to be connected, one to the oth er. Assessme nt and analysis of stem cell saf ety in the clinical setting will be vitally important to the development of eff icacious stem cell therapies.  -16-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR REGENERATIVE & RE PARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Recommendations The Working Groups' recommendations have been designated into three general categories depending upon whether implementation might occur on level of an individual NHLBI Division (Division Interest), or the entire Institute (NHLBI Interest), or involve multiple Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH-wide Interest). In addition, it is noted whether the recommendation is for a new program, the continued support of an ongoing program, or for both. The items are liste d in priority orde r. 1. Basic research on stem cell biology (NIH-wide Interest). The recommendation is for a strong, continued emphasis o n the su pport of basic stem cell research as the basis for future preclinical and clinical advances for new cell-based therapies. Stem cell niche (NHLBI Interest). The W orking Group recommends new projects on the influence of the stem cell niche or environment on the differentiation of the cells. It is felt tools are available to structurally and fun ctionally d efin e the ste m cell niche inclu ding ste m cell-stromal cell interactions. Cellular and tissue rege nera tion (NHLBI Intere st). The Working Group recommended new studies of natural cellular or tissue mechanisms for the regeneration of cells, tissues and organs involving resident stem, precursor, and diffe rentiated cell types. Immune response (NHLBI Intere st). New research needs to be initiated on the immunoge nic pote ntial of stem and precursor cells a re recommend ed. This will address the question of tolerance or the development of histocompatibility for engrafte d allogeneic cells. Non-invasive new imaging techniques (NIH-wide Interest). The Working Group unanimously indicated new and improved methods are needed to track cell fat e in vivo f or animal stu dies and for clinical res earch. The Group f elt advances in these techniques would greatly accelerate the pace of research. Advancement of new lung cell-based therapies (Division Interest). The Working Group identified pulmonary stem and progenitor cell research as key areas in need of development. The following new areas were recommended by the Group to as key focus areas to accomplish this goal: (1) Studies to identif ying curren tly unide ntifie d lung ste m cells; (2) Research on the facto rs that control growth and development of lung and lung vasculature; (3) Development of lung cell clonogenic assays; (4) Tools for lung functional genomics such as gene inactivation techno logy; (5) a lung genome project modeled afte r the hematopoietic stem cell database; (6) a lung resource project to generate cDNA libraries from embryonic and adult lung cells; and (7) preclinical an imal models an d translat ional stu dies inves tigating stem cell repair of lung injury. Cardiomyogenic potential of stem cells (Division Interest). This new area was of interest to the W orking Group due to its clear clinical relevance. To  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  -17-   8.  9.  10.  11.  12.  13.  14.  accelerate this area, the Group recommended preclinical research in three key areas: (1) assess of the cardiomyogenic differentiation potential of various stem cell sources; (2) determina tion of the exte nt and basis of physiolog ic improvement as the result of the cellular therapy; and (3) determination of the mechanism of improvement and heart repair whether due to the incorporation of cardiomyocytes or due to alternate mechanisms. Tissue engineering and bioengineering (NHLBI Interest). The Group thought these programs were playing a key role in the development of cell-based therapies and recommended continued support of the Bioe ngineering Research Partnerships and Tissue Engineering grants. Training programs (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended sponsorship of both new training programs and the continuation of on going training p rograms to build interdisciplinary communities of investigators who study stem cells and cell-based therapies. Stem cell meetings and workshops (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended both new stem cell workshops and the continuation of regular stem cell meet ings spo nsored by NHLBI to f oster the exchan ge of scientif ic info rmation an d to bu ilding inte rdisciplinary commu nities of stem cell investigators. As the field develops, the group recommended the NHLBI sponsor the formation of workshops to address a specific preclinical or clinical issue for the purpose of developing a consensu s report on the topic. Embryonic stem cells (NHLBI Interest). The Working Group thought the new area of human embryonic stem cell lines off ers unique therapeutic oppo rtunities, a novel avenue for developmental biology studies, and new opportunities for preclinical testing and pharmaceutical development. The Group recommended six research areas be pursued to promote this new area: (1) the development of so matic cell nucle ar recond itioning f or the ge neratio n of non-immuno genic cells fo r use in transp lantat ion; (2) the establish ment of protoco ls for large -scale cell differentiation and isolation of cells for therapeutic use; (3) the development of gene transfer protocols for use with embryonic stem cells; (4) the develo pment o f tran splanta tion meth ods to remo ve und iff erentia ted emb ryonic stem cells f rom cellular prod ucts; (5) the develop ment of cell delivery syste ms for clinical use; and (6) preclinical translational studies to study the use of embryonic cells as cell-based therapies. Embryonic stem cell data workshop (NIH-wide Interest). The Group recommended a new workshop be held to standardize embryonic stem cell data collection and comparisons, thus enabling the direct comparison of data among stem cell laboratories. The Group felt this should include the standardization of cell reference standards and reference techniques, such as the choice of the microarray. Centers (NHLBI Interest). The Working Group recommended new or continuation of ce nters, con sortiums, or Sp ecialized Ce nters of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCORs) to encourage collaborative teams with multi-disciplinary basic and clinical investigators. Some members of the Group thought Cente rs were the best approach to achieve new regene rative therapies. Clinical studies (NHLBI Interest). The Group recommended new clinical studies in four areas: (1) stem cell delivery; (2) integration of cells into the target  -18-   15.  16.  tissues; (3) clinical outcome of the therapy; and (4) safety of cell-based therapy. The Group thought clinical trials should not be undertaken prematurely, but at the appropriate time important initial clinical disease targets include these f ive areas: (1) heart failure due to myocardial infarction; (2) heart failure due to cardiomyopathies; (3) severe congestive heart failure; (4) end stage emphysema; and (5) obstructive vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. From stem cell to somatic cell (NHLBI Interest). Using genomics and proteomics for characterization of RNA and protein expression profiles, the Working Group recommended new studies to define the progression from stem cell to adult cell type, such as mature cardiac myocyte, smooth muscle, endo thelial cell, p neumo cyte, an d blood cells. The Grou p fe lt basic developmental studies were a key to accelerating new therapies. Resource needs (NHLBI Interest). The Group identified the following seven new research resources needed to remove potential roadblocks in the field: (1) stem cell banks to increase the availability of cells to all investigators; (2) bioinformatics and informatics network to promote sharing stem cell data, e.g., microarray ana lysis data; (3) central reso urces f or major equ ipment, e .g., cell sorters an d conf ocal microscop es, not available at individu al laborat ories; (4) a registry of transge nic mice fo r use in stem ce ll research stu dies; (5) core facilities for functional genomics and proteomics to increase the availability of these tools; (6) a ste m cell website pro viding inf ormation f or both in vestigat ors and patient groups; (7) availability of good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade mediators and factors needed for culture of stem cells in vitro; and (8) the develo pment o f an imal models to establish eff icacy and assess ph ysiologic utility for repair, to develop delivery devices and imaging capabilities, and to develop models to mirror human diseases.  -19-   NHLBI WORKING GROUP: CELL-BASED THERAPIES FOR RE GE NER ATIV E & REPARAT IVE MEDICINE : V ISIO N, S CO PE , AND DIR EC TIONS Po ok s Hill Ma rr iott, B ethe sda , MD May 1-2, 2002 May 1 7:45 AM 8:15 8:30 Coff ee/Continental Breakf ast Welcome and Charge to group: Dr. Al ving , De pu ty Dir ect or, NHLB I Current state of the science Session 1 9:00 9:15 10:30 10:40 10:55 12:00 Tools, Technologies and other Resources Dr. Blau Dr. Sharkis Dr. Verfa illie  Sources of Cells for Cell-based Therapies Discussion Panel: Drs.

These opportunities, often times considered high risk, can hold the promise of high societal payoffs. The research related to nonhuman embryonic stem (ES) cells is one such study. More than 10 years of basic research in primate developmental biology by research teams led by Dr. John Hearn at the NCRR-funded Wisconsin National Primate Research Center enabled the first isolation and culturing of ES cells from nonhuman primates in 1995. Using knowledge gained from these studies, Dr. James Thomson and his colleagues took the conquest forward in 1998 when they isolated and propagated human ES cells. (See ""Exploring the Promise of Stem Cells,"" page 5.) While the potential for stem cell therapies appears to hold great promise, the research is truly on the leading edge of a new frontier. Before their potential can be assessed, substantial basic research must take place on the characterization, mechanisms of differentiation, and regulation of cellular process of ES cells. To advance the frontier, NCRR, along with five other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has issued infrastructure enhancement awards to increase the capacity for basic research using human ES cells for preclinical investigations. The awards, which support entities listed on the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry, are designed to increase the supplies and access to cells that are self-renewing and well-characterized for quality controls. The overall objective of the support is to ensure that investigators have access to a sufficient quantity of cells for research and testing in multiple laboratories. This objective will be accomplished by providing funding for expansion, testing, quality assurance, and distribution of cell lines listed on the human ES cell registry. The development of quality controls to monitor the laboratory performance of the human ES cells also is an integral part of the initiative. This research, like much of the biomedical inquiry process in its early stages, requires investigators to cross check and validate their results. The ES cell research opportunities once again highlight the importance of well-developed infrastructure to advance a new research frontier. Like the early work on ES cells at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, advances in biomedical science depend on state-of-the-art research environments. At their best, such environments not only include novel research tools and technologies but also facilitate collaboration among scientists and sharing of expertise. Through these infrastructure enhancement awards and other sources of research support, NCRR facilitates discovery by providing the resources that help researchers explore the promise found on today's biomedical frontier. This quar terly publication of the National Center for Research Resources fosters communication, collaboration, and resource sharing in areas of current interest to scientists and the public.

At NCRR-funded General Clinical Research Centers and other sites around the countr y, scientists administered a two-week course of antibody treatment to patients who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the previous 6 weeks. Results showed that the antibody treatment maintained or improved insulin production in 9 of 12 patients for at least a year, while insulin production declined in 10 of 12 untreated patients. Treatment side effects were minor. The researchers speculate that the antibody treatment may enhance protective immune responses while stifling immune responses that ultimately cause annihilation of insulin-producing pancreatic cells. --New England Journal of Medicine 346:1692-1698, 2002.  ran his flies through a series of tubular mazes that required insects to make sequential choices as to whether to move up or down. Most flies chose randomly, but some exhibited clear preferences for the upper or lower tubes, a behavior Dr. Hirsch dubbed ""geotaxis."" By consecutively breeding selected flies, Dr. Hirsch created lines of insects that consistently preferred upward or downward movement, which suggested that genes must be influencing their behavior. However, the responsible genes were not identified until this year, when scientists employed a new research tool known as cDNA  prove useful for discovering additional behavior-associated genes. --Nature Genetics 31:349-353, 2002.  Cancer Spreads in Tumor Margins Scientists have long suspected that lymphatic vessels both in and around tumors might ser ve as a conduit for metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells. Now a research team has shown that this long-held hunch may be only par tly correct. Investigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, including a researcher now at the NCRR-funded Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Angiogenesis at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute, have found that the lymphatic vessels surrounding--but not within--tumors are culpable in the dispersal of cancer. To prove this point, the researchers created tumor cell lines that overexpressed vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), a chemical known to stimulate the growth of lymphatic vessels, and implanted the cells in the hind limb of immunodeficient mice. Compared to mice that received tumor-cell implants that generated normal amounts of VEGF-C, the mice with enhanced VEGF-C production had more extensive spreading of tumors via the lymph system. The scientists also obser ved a proliferation of functioning lymphatic vessels surrounding the tumors, in the so-called tumor margins, whereas vessels within the tumors were collapsed or blocked. The scientists concluded that metastasis occurs via lymphatic vessels in tumor margins and suggested that drugs targeting VEGF-C might inhibit the spread of cancer. --Science 296:1883-1886, 2002. S.S.  Scientists Identify ""Gravity Genes"" In the early 1960s, Dr. Jerr y Hirsch at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign launched the field of behavioral genetics by demonstrating that genetic differences in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster influence the insect's response to gravity. Now, four decades later, scientists have identified three genes that play a role in this behavior. To show that Drosophila have gravity-responsive genes, Dr. Hirsch  microarray analysis, or DNA chips. Using this approach, which identifies the multiple genes expressed in specific organs such as the brain, the scientists were able to narrow their search for geotaxis genes to four candidates. Then using flies with mutations in these four genes, plus flies with mutations in five control genes, the scientists verified that three of the four candidate genes did indeed influence geotaxis behavior. Some of the fly mutants were obtained from the NCRR-funded Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center in Indiana. This approach for pinpointing genes may also NCRR Repor ter  3  Fall 2002   Reporter Fall2002  11/20/02  4:43 PM  Page 4   Reporter Fall2002  11/20/02  4:43 PM  Page 5  Exploring the Promise of  Stem Cells by Brenda Patoine tem cells have captured the world's attention for their potential use as therapies for devastating conditions such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and even heart disease. With their capacity to generate every cell type in the body, stem cells have been hailed as virtually unlimited sources for tissue and organ replacements, potentially eliminating the need for organ donors. Yet, for all the hype and hope surrounding these versatile cells, any clinical application is, by all accounts, years or even decades away. Scientists are still struggling to understand how embryonic stem (ES) cells generate daughter cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types. And researchers have not yet perfected the conditions for producing large quantities of these cells in an undifferentiated state. All of these hurdles must be overcome before the true promise of ES cells can be realized. ""To make good judgments about how embryonic stem cells function Dr. James Thomson and his colleagues were the first to isolate embr yonic stem cell lines from nonhuman primates and from humans. (Photo by Jeff Miller, University of Wisconsin-Madison)  S  and differentiate, we first need to know how to expand their production and select the best quality control criteria,"" says Dr. Anthony Hayward, director of NCRR's Division of Clinical Research. Toward that end NCRR, along with five other NIH institutes, announced in April 2002 the first grants in its Infrastructure Enhancement Awards in human ES cell research. The two-year grants are designed to enable the laboratories that originally derived human ES cells to expand, test, and distribute their cells to qualified investigators. As of September 2002, five laboratories that have cell lines on the NIH Registry had received awards totaling more than $2.1 million: the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF); the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation in Madison; the Karolinska Institute in Sweden; BresaGen, Ltd. in Athens, Georgia; and ES Cell International Pte. Ltd., of Singapore and Melbourne, Australia. NCRR has long supported ES cell research in animals, most notably the pioneering studies conducted by Dr. James Thomson, Dr. John Hearn, and their colleagues at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (NPRC). In 1995 the researchers  reported the first isolation and culturing of ES cells from a nonhuman primate--the rhesus macaque. The researchers empirically determined that ES cells could be plucked from a sphere of embryonic cells, known as the blastocyst, and grown on a blanket of mouse connective tissue cells called fibroblasts. These ""feeder cells,"" which secrete factors that support the growth of the ES cells and prevent them from differentiating, proved to be the critical element in producing rhesus ES cell cultures. Importantly, cultured rhesus ES cells appeared to be capable of differentiating into the various cell types of the body. When treated with certain chemicals in culture or injected into immunodeficient mice to avoid problems with immune rejection, the ES cells differentiated into cells found in bone, muscle, nervous system, and other tissues. (For more information, see the NCRR Reporter, September/October 1995, pp. 4-7.) Using knowledge gained from their nonhuman primate studies, Dr. Thomson and his colleagues took a significant step forward in 1998, when they isolated and propagated ES cells from humans. ""The monkey studies were certainly a useful pre-  NCRR Repor ter  5  Fall 2002   Reporter Fall2002  11/20/02  4:43 PM  Page 6  lude to the human work,"" comments Dr. John D. Harding, a health scientist administrator in NCRR's Division of Comparative Medicine, which supports the network of National Primate Research Centers across the country. ""The Wisconsin studies demonstrated early on the feasibility of deriving embryonic stem cells from primates."" As in their nonhuman primate work, Dr. Thomson and his colleagues derived their human ES cell lines from cells formed only days after the egg was fertilized and started dividing. Shortly after the Wisconsin researchers announced their accomplishment, researchers at Johns Hopkins University reported that they had also cultured human ES cell lines, although theirs were derived from primordial germ cells--precursors of human sperm and eggs--taken from medically aborted 5- to 8-week-old embryos. Although these initial studies of human ES cells were privately funded, in August 2001 the U.S. government began to allow the use of federal funds to support research with approved, pre-existing human ES cell lines, including several derived by Dr. Thomson's laboratory. These cell lines are listed in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry (http://escr.nih.gov). Scientists say federal support of stem cell infrastructure is critical  because it allows NIH, rather than a commercial entity, to ""set the bar"" for quality assurance of distributed cells, says Dr. Keith Yamamoto, vice dean for research at UCSF School of Medicine. ""When we know that everyone is starting with the same material, we will be better able to compare experiments from different laboratories,"" he says. Although some of the institutions listed in the stem cell registry had begun shipping human ES cells prior to the infrastructure grants, federal funding is expected to dramatically enhance distribution. The infrastructure grants are designed to meet the individual needs of each institution,  entists with enough cells to have a ""master stock"" of their own to propagate while using some of the cells for experiments, says Dr. Hayward. Before shipping the cells, scientists analyze them for certain cell-surface markers that identify the cells as both undifferentiated and capable of differentiating, while other markers detect chromosomal abnormalities. These various quality assurances are critical because the cells are expected one day to be used in the treatment of degenerative diseases. A major barrier to using ES cells clinically has been the requisite use of mouse feeder cells in their production. Typically, human  Scientists say federal infrastructure allows a commercial entity, for quality assurance  support of stem cell NIH, rather than to ""set the bar"" of distributed cells. ES cells are grown on a layer of mouse fibroblasts, which provide still-unidentified growth factors that maintain the cells in an undifferentiated state. Unfortunately, reliance on mouse cells opens the door to potential transmission of pathogens, particularly animal viruses, from the feeder cells to the human ES cells. But now, in the September 2002 issue of Natur e Biotechnology, scientists from ES Cell International describe a new technique that uses human,  whether those needs are to rent space, purchase incubators, or add staff, says Dr. Hayward. ""We're simply trying to give these laboratories enough money to enable them to switch from exclusively producing cells for their own research to also producing cells for other laboratories,"" he says. The infrastructure grants also require that laboratories ship at least 200,000 cells to researchers who request them. This will provide sci-  Embr yonic stem cells can be isolated after a fer tilized egg (1) develops into a ball of cells called a blastocyst (2). From inside a blastocyst, the inner cell mass is extracted (3) and deposited (4) on a thin blanket of feeder cells, which allow the undifferentiated stem cells to proliferate.

The researchers first cultured human fibroblasts from adult fallopian tubes or from fetal muscle and skin. A layer of these feeder cells, or the solution in which they were grown, was then used to nurture cultures of human ES cells. With either the feeder cells or the solution, the human ES cells grew at least as well as they did with mouse feeder cells, and they retained all the expected characteristics of stem cells.

Besides heart tissue, the University of WisconsinMadison has programs to develop blood, pancreatic, and neural cells. If potential drugs can be tested in vitro on normally functioning organ tissue, scientists might be better able to evaluate their effects. Once the therapeutic potential of ES cells is determined, any treatments will likely be evaluated in the NCRR-supported General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs), says Dr. Hayward.

From tollbooths to airport security to doors unlocked by an employee badge, selective passageways allow entry only when certain criteria are met. On a vastly smaller scale, selective passageways also play a critical role in human health. The outer membrane of every living cell--in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans--is riddled with tiny pores known as ion channels, which are specially designed to permit selective and rapid passage of specific electrically charged atoms, or ions. These specialized cellular channels are so critical to life that their malfunction can trigger a host of human disorders, including epilepsy, myesthenia gravis, cystic fibrosis, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Discovering how ion channels operate has been the mission of Dr. Roderick MacKinnon, professor of neurobiology and biophysics at The Rockefeller University in New York City and Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Although the existence of ion channels has been generally acknowledged for nearly half a century, it wasn't until 1998 that Dr. MacKinnon and his colleagues gave the world its first detailed look at the molecular architecture of a selective ion channel--a simple bacterial channel selective for positively charged potassium ions. And it wasn't until this year, in May 2002, that scientists were able to see the structural details of how a specialized ""gated"" ion channel must operate. In another breakthrough finding, Dr. MacKinnon's research team deciphered the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of bacterial chloride channels, offering the first-ever atomic-scale glimpse of a negative-ion channel (see the NCRR Reporter, Summer 2002, p. 3). These and other dramatic advances in understanding ion channel architecture were reported in relatively rapid succession, within a 5-year timeframe, by the Rockefeller scientists. Their success has depended not only on the dedication and creativity of Dr. MacKinnon's research team but also on the ready access to shared instrumentation and expert staff at the NCRR-supported biomedical technology resource centers--particularly the National Resource for Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Biological Macromolecules, headed by Dr. Brian Chait at Rockefeller University, and the Macromolecular Diffraction Biotechnology Resource (MacCHESS), located at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source in Ithaca, New York. Dr. MacKinnon's team collaborated with colleagues in Dr. Chait's mass spectrometry resource to isolate and analyze ion channel components so that they could be more readily crystallized. And at MacCHESS, exceptionally brilliant X-rays were trained on the crystallized ion channels to expose their 3-D structures in unprecedented detail. ""Our collaborative studies of the crystal structures could not have occurred without the equipment and instruments purchased with NCRR support, both in Brian Chait's resource and at MacCHESS,"" says Dr. MacKinnon. By determining the 3-D structures of a variety of ion channels, the Rockefeller scientists have answered questions that had puzzled biologists since the 1950s, when the Nobel Prize-winning studies of A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley first suggested that selective ion channels must exist, although they were too small to be seen. How else to explain their observations that sodium and potassium ions rapidly traverse the cell membrane--in a predictable and controlled fashion--when an electrical signal travels down a neuron? Further research led scientists to conclude that ion channels must come in a variety of shapes and sizes that allow them to discriminate among various ions, although the structural details remained elusive. Less than a decade ago, Dr. MacKinnon decided to attempt a feat that many considered virtually impossible-- that is, solving the ion channel structure via X-ray crystallography, perhaps the most powerful technique available for analyzing the 3-D molecular structures. (For more information, see the NCRR Reporter, Spring 2002, pp. 21-23.) But to employ this approach, sample molecules must first  Dr. Roderick MacKinnon depended on state-of-the-ar t tools in X-ray cr ystallography and mass spectrometr y to uncover the structural details of selective ion channels.

Each ion channel is a multiprotein complex made up of unwieldy molecules that are difficult to stack and pack into the orderly crystal lattice needed for X-ray analysis. Undaunted, Dr. MacKinnon and his colleagues chose a simple potassium channel from the bacterium Streptomyces lividans for their initial crystallization efforts. In collaboration with Dr. Chait, the scientists generated and purified relatively large quantities of the channel protein, which has sequence similarity to all known potassium channels. Some of the purified proteins were placed into artificial membranes for studies of channel function, which helped to pinpoint critical channel regions. The scientists then used enzymes to trim away nonessential or ungainly protein regions. Mass spectrometry greatly facilitated these efforts, Dr. MacKinnon says, since the advanced instrumentation and expertise in Dr. Chait's resource enabled rapid analysis of protein  Dr. MacKinnon attempted a feat that many considered virtually impossible--solving the ion channel structure via X-ray crystallography. fragments and could readily determine if enzyme treatment had harmed the protein structure. (For more information about mass spectrometry, see the NCRR Reporter, Spring 2002, pp. 16-19.) With suitably trimmed proteins in hand, the scientists made dozens of crystallization attempts, and mass spectrometry was repeatedly used to assess protein integrity in the many crystals. ""Before Dr. MacKinnon travels to the synchrotron to analyze the samples, he needs to know that he has high-quality crystals. Time on the synchrotron is very precious,"" says Dr. Chait. Indeed, synchrotron radiation is considered such a valuable tool by the biomedical community, and is in such high demand, that most synchrotron resources have tight schedules and long waiting lists of scientists who wish to gain access. Poor crystals make poor use of this valuable resource, Dr. Chait notes. At the MacCHESS resource, the brilliant synchrotron X-rays were focused on the crystallized proteins, and computers analyzed how the X-rays were deflected, or diffracted, as they passed through. Based on these diffraction patterns, computational analyses deciphered the protein's three-dimensional structure at a resolution  of 3.2 angstroms, which revealed atomic-scale details never before seen. Since these structural findings were published in 1998, the Rockefeller scientists have used similar techniques and resources to solve a variety of ion channel structures and elaborate on the details of the original one. One recent puzzle solved by the MacKinnon group involves the gating mechanism that opens and closes many ion channels. A variety of gated channels exist, including ligand-gated channels, which swing open when signaling molecules unlatch the gate, and voltage-gated channels, which open in response to electrical stimuli. The Rockefeller scientists managed to crystallize an intact and open ligand-gated potassium channel, which is opened via calcium binding. Synchrotron analyses revealed a ring-shaped structure, made up of four identical doubleprotein subunits, at the channel's base. In the cell, this structure lies just inside the membrane. Calcium binding provides the chemical energy needed to stretch open the gate like the mouth of a balloon, thereby enabling potassium entry. Drs. MacKinnon, Chait, and their colleagues are now pursuing the structural details of voltagegated mechanisms, which may prove useful in designing treatments for so-called channelopathies such as the rare, sometimes fatal heart disorder known as long QT syndrome. In this disorder, potassium channels in heart muscle cells behave abnormally, due to either mutations in channel proteins or the binding of certain drugs to the channel. ""Like many channel-related disorders, long QT syndrome is caused by a mix of factors that we're still trying to understand,"" comments Dr. MacKinnon. ""One approach that we're now pursuing is to study how drugs that can cause the syndrome bind to the potassium channel."" --Victoria L.

""I used to drive my wife nuts. I'd be thinking about upcoming meals before I finished the one I was eating,"" he says. ""At breakfast, I'd be asking her `What's for lunch?' `What's for dinner?'"" As a result of his prodigious weight, Rudolph was barely able to take care of himself. He needed help putting on his shoes and taking a bath, and he had to use an electric cart to go shopping. Then three and a half years ago, Rudolph underwent an operation called a gastric bypass, in which the esophagus and a small adjoining area of stomach are attached near the beginning of the small intestine. After the surgery, Rudolph found that he was no longer preoccupied with food. ""Now I'm not driven by hunger,"" he says. ""It's more like I just run out of steam and need to eat something to keep going."" His weight dropped to 260 pounds, and he is leading a more active life. Rudolph is one of an increasing number of people who are getting gastric bypass operations to treat extreme obesity. Although studies showed that the operation was more effective than other procedures for weight loss, physicians did not fully understand how the operation worked. Now a study conducted at the NCRR-funded General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the University of Washington in Seattle suggests that gastric bypass triggers weight loss in part by reducing the blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin. Discovered just three years ago by scientists in Japan, ghrelin initially was of interest because of its ability to stimulate the release of growth hormone. Then researchers found that injecting ghrelin into rodents increased their food intake and promoted fat accumulation, and infusing the hormone into their brains activated nerve cells known to help regulate feeding behavior. Later, investigators in the United Kingdom determined that injecting the hormone into people caused them to eat 30 percent more food at an all-you-can-eat buffet. These findings suggested that rising ghrelin levels might be the hunger signal that triggers eating, or at least a major component of that signal. Endocrinologist Dr. David Cummings at the University of Washington reasoned that if ghrelin was indeed the mediator of mealtime hunger, then circulating ghrelin levels should rise right before a meal and fall shortly after eating. At the University of Washington GCRC, Dr. Cummings and his colleagues investigated this theory by collecting 38  measurements of ghrelin levels in healthy volunteers over a 24-hour period. They found that ghrelin levels rose by an average of 78 percent one to two hours before the onset of each meal and fell within one hour after eating. Also, peak ghrelin levels were higher than the level produced by administering the smallest ghrelin dose that stimulates eating. ""The data are fairly compelling that ghrelin plays a role in triggering ordinary premeal hunger and therefore participates in the decision to start a meal,"" says Dr. Cummings. Next, the investigators measured ghrelin levels over 24-hour periods in two groups of obese people who had lost weight, one group from dieting and the other from gastric bypass surgery. In the group that had lost weight by eating a low-calorie diet, ghrelin levels rose before each meal and fell afterward, just as they had in the normal-weight volunteers. However, baseline ghrelin levels for the 24-hour period were higher in the dieting group than in the normal-weight volunteers. For most of the dieters, the more weight that was lost, the more baseline ghrelin levels increased. ""Generally, dieters will tell you that they get hungrier after they lose weight, which may be why people tend to regain their weight,"" says Dr. Cummings. ""Increased ghrelin levels may be one of the mechanisms behind this increased hunger."" In contrast, the overall ghrelin levels in the gastric bypass patients were so low that they could hardly be  After his gastric bypass operation, Jim Rudolph dropped 200 pounds and several pants sizes. New evidence suggests that this type of operation alters hormone levels that control hunger.

Also, the levels were perfectly flat throughout the day, with no peaks and valleys around mealtimes. A gastric bypass operation creates a shunt around most of the stomach and all of the first part of the small intestine, which are the areas where most of the ghrelin is produced. As a result, food never contacts the ghrelinproducing cells in this region. ""Something about this rewiring of the gastrointestinal tract seems to silence the principal ghrelin-producing cells,"" says Dr. Cummings. Coincident with this drop in ghrelin is a generalized loss of hunger. Studies have shown that gastric bypass patients eat fewer meals and fewer calorie-dense foods, such as cake and ice cream, not through an exertion of willpower but simply because they are less hungry. ""The suppression of ghrelin after gastric bypass may be a reason why hunger does not rise after this procedure but in fact falls,"" says Dr. Cummings. The GCRC played a critical role in these studies, according to Dr. Cummings. The center allowed the investigators to conduct frequent blood samplings, which would have been difficult to do in any other setting. Also, the research dieticians at the center monitored food intake and prepared special diets. To measure percentages of body fat, the scientists used the center's underwater weighing equipment.  Dr. David Cummings and his colleagues discovered that the hormone ghrelin might play a role in triggering premeal hunger.

My own prediction is that a ghrelin blocker will not make you lose a lot of weight by itself but might make it easier to lose weight through dieting and exercise."" --Steven Stocker This research is supported by the Division of Clinical Research of the National Center for Research Resources, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. For mor e infor mation about the NCRR Division of Clinical Research, see www.ncrr.nih.gov/clinical_rsrch.asp.  Rising ghrelin levels might be part of the hunger signal that triggers eating. Pharmaceutical companies are currently developing drugs that block ghrelin action in the brain, hoping that these drugs may facilitate weight loss. Whether they do or not may depend on the type of obesity, according to Dr. Cummings. He predicts that ghrelin blockers should work ""like gangbusters"" in patients who are obese because of Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. His group found that ghrelin levels in these patients were the highest yet measured in humans, which implicates ghrelin as the driving force behind their intense eating. In contrast, ghrelin levels in ordinary obesity are actually lower than normal. These reduced levels may be part of the body's reaction to obesity, rather than a cause, he suggests. Whether a ghrelin blocker would help people with ordinary obesity lose weight is unclear, says Dr. Cummings. ""It might, especially since ghrelin tends to rise when you lose weight through dieting. If you could block that rise,  Additional Reading 1. Cummings, D. E., Weigle, D. S., Frayo, R. S., et al., Plasma ghrelin levels after diet-induced weight loss or gastric bypass surger y.

Headed by Dr. Davidson, who is the Norman Chandler Professor of Cell Biology at Caltech, the resource prepares and distributes high-density arrayed filters, or macroarrays, that contain large complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries from the sea urchin. The macroarrays allow scientists to rapidly assess and compare gene expression in various stages of sea urchin development and in various cell types. With more than a decade of NCRR funding, Dr. Davidson has developed advanced culture and molecular techniques for studying S. purpuratus and has produced an inbred line of animals, which is now up to an eighth generation. Inbreeding helps to create a more uniform gene pool, allowing scientists to more readily pinpoint the location of each nucleotide in a gene. As a laboratory animal, the sea urchin is appreciated for its versatility and expediency. Each animal produces millions of eggs or sperm, providing an almost unlimited supply of basic genetic material; even rare proteins can be fairly easily isolated from this abundance of raw material. Sea urchin embryogenesis takes several days, beginning with a fertilized egg and ending with the creation of a transparent larva. Its transparency simplifies experimental manipulation and observation. Like many other marine invertebrates, S. purpuratus undergoes ""maximal indirect development,"" meaning that the process by which an embryo transforms into a larva is utterly unlike the process by which a larva becomes a juvenile. Each process also utilizes an entirely different set of precursor cells. Molecular developmental biologists have taken advantage of these distinct processes, focusing much of their research on the first step, embryogenesis, which is simpler and more easily manipulated. Much of the day-to-day work in Dr. Davidson's laboratory involves microinjecting particular DNA segments into sea urchin eggs, modifying small bits of sequence at a time, and then observing the consequences. The scientists also are able to block expression of any given gene and then measure the resulting effects to other related genes. In this way, the scientists have delineated the complex interactions by which genes regulate other genes during the development of specialized tissues in the first 24 hours of life. Perhaps 50 of the 8,500 genes expressed in the sea urchin embryo are involved in this  Each animal produces millions of eggs or sperm, providing an almost unlimited supply of basic genetic material. its development from fertilized egg to free-swimming larva. The Caltech scientists have long recognized what a growing segment of the biomedical community is beginning to appreciate--that the sea urchin is a unique and tractable organism with enormous potential for shedding light on the most basic biological processes, including many that are relevant to human health. Indeed, the National Human Genome Research Institute recently selected the sea urchin as a top priority for genome sequencing, along with the genomes of the chimpanzee, dog, cow, and other animals of scientific interest. According to Dr. Davidson, sea urchin research is now poised to make important contributions to broad biomedical areas, including cell biology, molecular embryology, fertilization biology, Dr. Eric Davidson heads the new evolution, and the Sea Urchin Genome Resource, which regulation of gene distributes cDNA-based macroarrays to qualified researchers worldwide. expression.

As elsewhere in the life sciences, making sense of so much data and so many interconnections depends heavily on modeling and computers. To aid such analyses, the Caltech scientists collaborated with other research teams to develop three software programs-- Netbuilder, FamilyRelations, and an early version of BioArray--that are available online and can be accessed by biomedical researchers free-of-charge (http://sea-urchin.caltech.edu/software). Scientists at the Sea Urchin Genome Resource also produce macroarrays, which are made available at cost of production to qualified researchers. These macroarrays are sets of six square nylon plates, 22 cm on a side, each holding 18,932 unique cDNA spots, laid out in duplicate by a robotic system. This setup allows researchers to interrogate more than 100,000 genes simultaneously by seeing where radioactively labeled test sequences bind to their complementary counterparts on the array. Another instrument then assesses each plate's two-dimensional image and records the exact location of any reactions. The identities of target clones can then be determined.  ""Studying gene expression during embryogenesis calls for a global analysis,"" like that provided by the macroarrays, says Dr. Davidson. ""We went to a lot of effort to get this technology, knowing how much we'd need it down the road."" Down the road lies the Sea Urchin Genome Project. As useful as the sea urchin is at present, Dr. Davidson says it will become even more valuable as the animals' genome is sequenced and comparisons can be made with the genomes of other organisms, including humans. Scientists already know that the spiny creatures are more closely related to humans than are those other staples of genetic research, the fruit fly and the nematode worm. Sea urchins are close enough to humans to make comparison worthwhile, yet distant enough to provide insight into the course of evolution over the last 540 million years. In the end, the intensive work by Dr. Davidson's group describes an interlocking information network of regulatory genes and transcription factors operating during embryogenesis. ""It's exceedingly complex and exceedingly important,"" says Dr. Davidson.

NCRR broadened the scope of the centers because of increased demand for nonhuman primates in the study of AIDS, neurobiology, cardiology, and other research areas. The first seven primate research centers were established in the 1960s, and an eighth center was added to the network in 1999. Today this network, located around the countr y, maintains more than 24,000 nonhuman primates and provides nonhuman primate cells, tissues, organs, and biological fluids to investigators all over the United States and the world. provided some of the earliest evidence that cer tain cancers can be inherited. In addition to its role in cancer research, Xiphophorus is also used for studying evolution of the immune system, neural systems that maintain balance, sex-determining genes, and brain distribution of chemicals that regulate growth and reproduction. Originally housed in various locations in New York City, the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center was transferred in 1992 to Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos. Today the Center maintains representatives of all but 1 of the 23 known Xiphophorus species and houses nearly 6,500 fish. For more information about the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center, visit www.xiphophorus.org.  Genetically Modified Mouse Strains Available The Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRC) Program--established by NCRR in 1999 to maintain and distribute strains of scientifically valuable, genetically modified mice--now has 11 strains available for distribution. Nine of the strains are maintained as live colonies, while the other two strains are maintained in a cr yopreser ved archive. The strains can be used for studying cardiovascular disease, cancer, and bone matrix biology, among other subjects. The MMRRC Web site (www.mmrrc.org) provides details on available strains as well as a list of new strains under development. Also on the Web site is information about procedures for submitting new strains for preser vation and distribution. For mice that are maintained in a live colony, the MMRRC customarily supplies investigators with one or two breeder pairs. For mice that are maintained in the form of cr yopreser ved embr yos or gametes, the MMRRC resuscitates the mice from the cr yopreser ved material before distribution. Fees are charged for distribution and cr yo-recover y to defray costs for ser vices, which include genetic quality control, phenotypic characterization of strains, and maintenance of a mouse resource database. The MMRRC network currently includes four facilities located at the University of Nor th Carolina at Chapel Hill; the University of California, Davis; Taconic Farms in New York, in collaboration with the State University of New York at Albany; and Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., in collaboration with the University of Missouri. The MMRRC Informatics Coordinating Center is at The Jackson Laborator y in Bar Harbor, Maine.

The award recognizes outstanding clinical investigators who have conducted studies in a GCRC within the previous decade. Dr. Crowley was honored for his pioneering work in the neuroendocrine control of human reproduction. He accepted the award at the 2002 GCRC Program Directors' Meeting, held in Baltimore. Dr. Crowley is known for developing long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists as the standard treatment for precocious puber ty. The agonists suppress release of the gonadotropin hormones that promote sexual development. Dr. Crowley also discovered that repeated administration of GnRH could induce sexual maturation in patients who had not undergone normal puber ty because of inadequate gonadotropin secretion.  Among the symposium presentations were several on potential vaccines designed to protect nonhuman primates from infection with SIV or combination SIV-HIV (SHIV) strains. One approach, developed by scientists at the New England NPRC, involves immunizing animals with an SIV strain that cannot replicate, which minimizes the chances that the vaccine might cause the disease it is supposed to prevent. Another approach, developed by scientists at the Washington NPRC and their colleagues, involves vaccinating monkeys with immune cells expressing SHIV antigens in order to generate immune responses against these antigens. Presentations from the symposium will be published in a for thcoming issue of the Journal of Medical Primatology.  NCRR Establishes a Chimpanzee Sanctuar y NCRR has awarded a contract to Chimp Haven, Inc.-- a private, nonprofit organization--to establish and operate a sanctuar y for chimpanzees no longer needed for biomedical research. Such a sanctuar y was mandated by The Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection (CHIMP) Act, passed in December 2000, to provide lifetime care for federally owned or suppor ted chimpanzees retired from research. Over the term of the 10-year contract, NCRR will provide approximately $19 million in total costs, and Chimp Haven will contribute approximately $4 million toward direct costs. In addition, NCRR has awarded a $5 million grant to Chimp Haven to suppor t construction of the new sanctuar y near Shrevepor t, Louisiana. In Spring 2004, the sanctuar y is expected to initially provide housing in a free-ranging environment for approximately 75 chimpanzees.

GX233-08-10876733	"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  INTRODUCTION A stem cell is a special kind of cell that has a unique capacity to renew itself and to give rise to specialized cell types. Although most cells of the body, such as heart cells or skin cells, are committed to conduct a specific function, a stem cell is uncommitted and remains uncommitted, until it receives a signal to develop into a specialized cell. Their proliferative capacity combined with the ability to become specialized makes stem cells unique. Researchers have for years looked for ways to use stem cells to replace cells and tissues that are damaged or diseased. Recently, stem cells have received much attention. What is "" new "" and what has brought stem cell biology to the forefront of science and public policy? Scientists interested in human development have been studying animal development for many years. This research yielded our first glimpse at a class of stem cells that can develop into any cell type in the body. This class of stem cells is called pluripotent, meaning the cells have the potential to develop almost all of the more than 200 different known cell types. Stem cells with this unique property come from embr yos and fetal tissue. In 1998, for the first time, investigators were able to isolate this class of pluripotent stem cell from early human embr yos and grow them in culture. In the few years since this discover y, evidence has emerged that these stem cells are, indeed, capable of becoming almost all of the specialized cells of the body and, thus, may have the potential to generate replacement cells for a broad array of tissues and organs, such as the heart, the pancreas, and the ner vous system. Thus, this class of human stem cell holds the promise of being able to repair or replace cells or tissues that are damaged or destroyed by many of our most devastating diseases and disabilities.  At about the same time as scientists were beginning to explore human pluripotent stem cells from embr yos and fetal tissue, a flurr y of new information was emerging about a class of stem cells that have been in clinical use for years--so-called adult stem cells. An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell that is found in a differentiated (specialized) tissue in the adult, such as blood. It can yield the specialized cell types of the tissue from which it originated. In the body, it too, can renew itself. During the past decade, scientists discovered adult stem cells in tissues that were previously not thought to contain them, such as the brain. More recently, they reported that adult stem cells from one tissue appear to be capable of developing into cell types that are characteristic of other tissues. For example, although adult hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow have long been recognized as capable of developing into blood and immune cells, recently scientists reported that, under certain conditions, the same stem cells could also develop into cells that have many of the characteristics of neurons. So, a new concept and a new term emerged-adult stem cell plasticity. Are human adult and embr yonic stem cells equivalent in their potential for generating replacement cells and tissues? Current science indicates that, although both of these cell types hold enormous promise, adult and embr yonic stem cells differ in important ways. What is not known is the extent to which these different cell types will be useful for the development of cell-based therapies to treat disease. Some considerations are noteworthy regarding this report. First, in recent months, there have been many discussions in the lay press about the anticipated abilities of stem cells from various sources and projected benefits to be realized from them in replacing cells and tissues in patients with various diseases. The terminology used to describe stem cells in the lay  ES-1   Executive Summar y  literature is often confusing or misapplied. Second, even among biomedical researchers, there is a lack of consistency in common terms to describe what stem cells are and how they behave in the research laborator y. Third, the field of stem cell biology is advancing at an incredible pace with new discoveries being reported in the scientific literature on a weekly basis. This summar y begins with common definitions and explanations of key concepts about stem cells. It ends with an assessment of how adult, embr yonic and fetal stem cells are similar and how they are different. In between lie important details that describe what researchers have discovered about stem cells and how they are being used in the laborator y.  cells are not themselves embr yos. In fact, evidence is emerging that these cells do not behave in the laborator y as they would in the developing embr yo--that is, the conditions in which these cells develop in culture are likely to differ from those in the developing embr yo. Embr yonic germ cell. An embr yonic germ cell is derived from fetal tissue. Specifically, they are isolated from the primordial germ cells of the gonadal ridge of the 5- to 10-week fetus. Later in development, the gonadal ridge develops into the testes or ovaries and the primordial germ cells give rise to eggs or sperm. Embr yonic stem cells and embr yonic germ cells are pluripotent, but they are not identical in their properties and characteristics. Differentiation. Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized cell (such as a stem cell) becomes specialized into one of the many cells that make up the body. During differentiation, certain genes become activated and other genes become inactivated in an intricately regulated fashion. As a result, a differentiated cell develops specific structures and per forms certain functions. For example, a mature, differentiated ner ve cell has thin, fiber-like projections that send and receive the electrochemical signals that permit the ner ve cell to communicate with other ner ve cells. In the laborator y, a stem cell can be manipulated to become specialized or partially specialized cell types (e.g., heart muscle, ner ve, or pancreatic cells) and this is known as directed differentiation. Adult stem cell. An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated (unspecialized) cell that occurs in a differentiated (specialized) tissue, renews itself, and becomes specialized to yield all of the specialized cell types of the tissue from which it originated. Adult stem cells are capable of making identical copies of themselves for the lifetime of the organism. This property is referred to as ""self-renewal."" Adult stem cells usually divide to generate progenitor or precursor cells, which then differentiate or develop into "" mature"" cell types that have characteristic shapes and specialized functions, e.g., muscle cell contraction or ner ve cell signaling. Sources of adult stem cells include bone marrow, blood, the cornea and the retina of the eye, brain, skeletal muscle, dental pulp, liver, skin, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. The most abundant information about adult human  DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL CONCEPTS ABOUT STEM CELLS In developing this report, some conventions were established to describe consistently what stem cells are, what characteristics they have, and how they are used in biomedical research. Here are some of the key definitions that are used throughout this report. Stem cell. A stem cell is a cell from the embr yo, fetus, or adult that has, under certain conditions, the ability to reproduce itself for long periods or, in the case of adult stem cells, throughout the life of the organism. It also can give rise to specialized cells that make up the tissues and organs of the body. Much basic understanding about embr yonic stem cells has come from animal research. In the laborator y, this type of stem cell can proliferate indefinitely, a property that is not shared by adult stem cells. Pluripotent stem cell. A single pluripotent stem cell has the ability to give rise to types of cells that develop from the three germ layers (mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm) from which all the cells of the body arise. The only known sources of human pluripotent stem cells are those isolated and cultured from early human embr yos and from fetal tissue that was destined to be part of the gonads. Embr yonic stem cell. An embr yonic stem cell is derived from a group of cells called the inner cell mass, which is part of the early (4- to 5-day) embr yo called the blastocyst. Once removed from the blastocyst, the cells of the inner cell mass can be cultured into embr yonic stem cells. These embr yonic stem  ES-2   Executive Summar y  stem cells comes from studies of hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells isolated from the bone marrow and blood. These adult stem cells have been extensively studied and applied therapeutically for various diseases. At this point, there is no isolated population of adult stem cells that is capable of forming all the kinds of cells of the body. Adult stem cells are rare. Often they are difficult to identify, isolate, and purify. There are insufficient numbers of cells available for transplantation and adult stem cells do not replicate indefinitely in culture. Plasticity. Plasticity is the ability of an adult stem cell from one tissue to generate the specialized cell type(s) of another tissue. A recently reported example of plasticity is that, under specific experimental conditions, adult stem cells from bone marrow generated cells that resemble neurons and other cell types that are commonly found in the brain. The concept of adult stem cell plasticity is new, and the phenomenon is not thoroughly understood. Evidence suggests that, given the right environment, some adult stem cells are capable of being ""genetically reprogrammed "" to generate specialized cells that are characteristic of different tissues. Clonality or clonally derived stem cell. A cell is said to be clonally derived or to exhibit clonality if it was generated by the division of a single cell and is genetically identical to that cell. In stem cell research, the concept of clonality is important for several reasons. For researchers to fully understand and harness the ability of stem cells to generate replacement cells and tissues, the exact identity of those cells' genetic capabilities and functional qualities must be known. Human pluripotent stem cells from embr yos and fetal tissue are by their nature clonally derived. However, ver y few studies have shown clonal properties of the cells that are developed from adult stem cells. It is crucial to know whether a single cell is capable of developing an array of cell types, or whether multiple stem cell types, that when grown together, are capable of forming multiple cell types. For instance, recent research has shown that a mixture of cells removed from fat tissue or umbilical cord blood are capable of developing into blood cells, bone cells, and perhaps others. Researchers have not shown that a single cell is responsible for giving rise to other cell types or, if so, what kind of cell it is. These results may well be attributable to multiple types of precursor cells  in the starting tissue; such results from fat cells may, in fact, be due to the presence of hematopoietic stem cells in the fat tissue. The importance of showing that one cell type can reproducibly become another and self-replicate cannot be overemphasized. Progenitor or precursor cell. A progenitor or precursor cell occurs in fetal or adult tissues and is partially specialized; it divides and gives rise to differentiated cells. Researchers often distinguish precursor/ progenitor cells from adult stem cells in the following way: when a stem cell divides, one of the two new cells is often a stem cell capable of replicating itself again. In contrast, when a progenitor/precursor cell divides, it can form more progenitor/precursor cells or it can form two specialized cells, neither of which is capable of replicating itself. Progenitor/precursor cells can replace cells that are damaged or dead, thus maintaining the integrity and functions of a tissue such as liver or brain. Progenitor/precursor cells give rise to related types of cells-lymphocytes such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, for example--but in their normal state do not generate a wide variety of cell types.  CHALLENGES IN STEM CELL RESEARCH It is important to understand some of the difficulties that researchers have had in isolating various types of stem cells, working with the cells in the laborator y, and proving experimentally that the cells are true stem cells. Most of the basic research discoveries on embr yonic and adult stem cells come from research using animal models, particularly mice. In 1981, researchers reported methods for growing mouse embr yonic stem cells in the laborator y, and it took nearly 20 years before similar achievements could be made with human embr yonic stem cells. Much of the knowledge about embr yonic stem cells has emerged from two fields of research: applied reproductive biology, i.e., in vitro fertilization technologies, and basic research on mouse embr yology. There have been many technical challenges that have been overcome in adult stem cell research as well. Some of the barriers include: the rare occurrence of adult stem cells among other, differentiated cells, difficulties in isolating and identifying the cells (researchers often use molecular "" markers"" to identify  ES-3   Executive Summar y  adult stem cells), and in many cases, difficulties in growing adult stem cells in tissue culture. Much of the research demonstrating the plasticity of adult stem cells comes from studies of animal models in which a mixture of adult stem cells from a donor animal is injected into another animal, and the development of new, specialized cells is traced. In 1998, James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison isolated cells from the inner cell mass of the early embr yo, called the blastocyst, and developed the first human embr yonic stem cell lines. At the same time, John Gearhart at Johns Hopkins University reported the first derivation of human embr yonic germ cells from an isolated population of cells in fetal gonadal tissue, known as the primordial germ cells, which are destined to become the eggs and sperm. From both of these sources, the researchers developed pluripotent stem cell "" lines,"" which are capable of renewing themselves for long periods and giving rise to many types of human cells or tissues. Human embr yonic stem cells and embr yonic germ cells differ in some characteristics, however, and do not appear to be equivalent. Why are the long-term proliferation ability and pluripotency of embr yonic stem cells and embr yonic germ cells so important? First, for basic research purposes, it is important to understand the genetic and molecular basis by which these cells continue to make many copies of themselves overlong periods of time. Second, if the cells are to be manipulated and used for transplantation, it is important to have sufficient quantities of cells that can be directed to differentiate into the desired cell type(s) and used to treat the many patients that may be suffering from a particular disease. In recent months, other investigators have been successful in using somewhat different approaches to deriving human pluripotent stem cells. At least 5 other laboratories have been successful in deriving pluripotent stem cells from human embr yos and one additional laborator y has created cell lines from fetal tissue. In each case, the methods for deriving pluripotent stem cells from human embr yos and embr yonic germ cells from fetal tissue are similar, yet they differ in the isolation and culture conditions as initially described by Thomson and Gearhart, respectively. It is not known to what extent U.S.-based researchers are using these additional sources of embr yonic stem and germ cells.  At present, there have been multiple human adult stem cell lines that have been created through a combination of public and private resources (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells). Substantial adult stem cell research has been under way for many years, and in recent years this has included basic studies on the "" plasticity "" of such cells.  WHAT KINDS OF RESEARCH MIGHT BE CONDUCTED WITH STEM CELLS? There has been much written about the new discoveries of various stem cell types and their properties. Importantly, these cells are research tools and they open many doors of opportunity for biomedical research.  Transplantation Research--Restoring Vital Body Functions Stem cells may hold the key to replacing cells lost in many devastating diseases. There is little doubt that this potential benefit underpins the vast interest about stem cell research. What are some of these diseases? Parkinson's disease, diabetes, chronic heart disease, end-stage kidney disease, liver failure, and cancer are just a few for which stem cells have therapeutic potential. For many diseases that shorten lives, there are no effective treatments but the goal is to find a way to replace what natural processes have taken away. For example, today, science has brought us to a point where the immune response can be subdued, so that organs from one person can be used to replace the diseased organs and tissues of another. But, despite recent advances in transplantation sciences, there is a shortage of donor organs that makes it unlikely that the growing demand for lifesaving organ replacements will be fully met through organ donation strategies. The use of stem cells to generate replacement tissues for treating neurological diseases is a major focus of research. Spinal cord injur y, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer 's disease are among those diseases for which the concept of replacing destroyed or dysfunctional cells in the brain or spinal cord is a practical goal. This report features several recent advances that demonstrate the regenerative properties of adult and embr yonic stem cells. Another major discover y frontier for research on adult and embr yonic stem cells is the development of  ES-4   Executive Summar y  transplantable pancreatic tissues that can be used to treat diabetes. Scientists in academic and industrial research are vigorously pursuing all possible avenues of research, including ways to direct the specialization of adult and embr yonic stem cells to become pancreatic islet-like cells that produce insulin and can be used to control blood glucose levels. Researchers have recently shown that human embr yonic stem cells to be directly differentiated into cells that produce insulin. There are common misconceptions about both adult and human embr yonic stem cells. First, the lines of unaltered human embr yonic stem cells that exist will not be suitable for direct use in patients. These cells will need to be differentiated or other wise modified before they can be used clinically. Current challenges are to direct the differentiation of embr yonic stem cells into specialized cell populations, and also to devise ways to control their development or proliferation once placed in patients. A second misconception is that adult stem cells are ready to use as therapies. With the exception of the clinical application of hematopoietic stem cells to restore the blood and immune system, this is not the case. The therapeutic use of this mixture of cells has proven safe because the mixture is place back into the environment from which it was taken, e.g., the bone marrow. In fact, many of the adult stem cell preparations currently being developed in the laborator y represent multiple cell types that are not fully characterized. In order to safely use stem cells or cells differentiated from them in tissues other than the tissue from which they were isolated, researchers will need purified populations (clonal lines) of adult stem cells. In addition, the potential for the recipient of a stem cell transplant to reject these tissues as foreign is ver y high. Modifications to the cells, to the immune system, or both will be a major requirement for their use. In sum, with the exception of the current practice of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, much basic research lies ahead before direct patient application of stem cell therapies is realized.  research that links developmental biology and stem cell biology is understanding the genes and molecules, such as growth factors and nutrients, that function during the development of the embr yo so that they can be used to grow stem cells in the laborator y and direct their development into specialized cell types.  Therapeutic Deliver y Systems Stem cells are already being explored as a vehicle for delivering genes to specific tissues in the body. Stem cell-based therapies are a major area of investigation in cancer research. For many years, restoration of blood and immune system function has been used as a component in the care of cancer patients who have been treated with chemotherapeutic agents. Now, researchers are tr ying to devise more ways to use specialized cells derived from stem cells to target specific cancerous cells and directly deliver treatments that will destroy or modify them.  Other Applications of Stem Cells Future uses of human pluripotent cell lines might include the exploration of the effects of chromosomal abnormalities in early development. This might include the ability to monitor the development of early childhood tumors, many of which are embr yonic in origin. Another future use of human stem cells and their derivatives include the testing of candidate therapeutic drugs. Although animal model testing is a mainstay of pharmaceutical research, it cannot always predict the effects that a developmental drug may have on human cells. Stem cells will likely be used to develop specialized liver cells to evaluate drug detoxifying capabilities and represents a new type of early warning system to prevent adverse reactions in patients. The coupling of stem cells with the information learned from the human genome project will also likely have many unanticipated benefits in the future.  Critical Evidence and Questions about Stem Cell Research What is the evidence that specialized cells generated from human stem cells can replace damaged or diseased cells and tissues? Currently, there are more questions than answers. Most of the evidence that stem cells can be directed to differentiate into specific types of cells suitable for  Basic Research Applications Embr yonic stem cells will undoubtedly be key research tools for understanding fundamental events in embr yonic development that one day may explain the causes of birth defects and approaches to correct or prevent them. Another important area of  ES-5   Executive Summar y  transplantation--for example, neurons, heart muscle cells, or pancreatic islet cells--comes from experiments with stem cells from mice. And although more is known about mouse stem cells, not all of that information can be translated to the understanding of human stem cells. Mouse and human cells differ in significant ways, such as the laborator y conditions that favor the growth and specialization of specific cell types. Another important aspect of developing therapies based on stem cells will be devising ways to prevent the immune system of recipients from rejecting the donated cells and tissues that are derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Modifying or evading the immune rejection of cells or tissues developed from embr yonic stem cells will not be able to be done exclusively using mouse models and human adult stem cells. As with any new research tool, it will also be important to compare the techniques and approaches that various laboratories are using to differentiate and use human embr yonic stem cells. Such research will provide a more complete understanding of the cells' characteristics. One key finding about the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells learned thus far is that relatively subtle changes in culture conditions can have dramatic influences on the types of cells that develop.  and they can give rise to mature cell types that have characteristic shapes and specialized functions of a particular tissue.  Adult stem cells are rare. Often they are difficult to identify, isolate, and purify.  One important, limiting factor for the use of adult stem cells in future cell-replacement strategies is that there are insufficient numbers of cells available for transplantation. This is because most adult stem cell lines when grown in a culture dish are unable to proliferate in an unspecialized state for long periods of time. In cases where they can be grown under these conditions, researchers have not been able to direct them to become specialized as functionally useful cells.  Stem cells from the bone marrow are the moststudied type of adult stem cells. Currently, they are used clinically to restore various blood and immune components to the bone marrow via transplantation. There are two major types of stem cells found in bone: hematopoietic stem cells which form blood and immune cells, and stromal (mesenchymal) stem cells that normally form bone, cartilage, and fat. The restricted capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to grow in large numbers and remain undifferentiated in the culture dish is a major limitation to their broader use for research and transplantation studies. Researchers have reported that at least two other populations of adult stem cells occur in bone marrow and blood, but these cells are not well characterized.  Evidence to date indicates that umbilical cord blood is an abundant source of hematopoietic stem cells. There do not appear to be any qualitative differences between the stem cells obtained from umbilical cord blood and those obtained from bone marrow or peripheral blood.  Several populations of adult stem cells have been identified in the brain, particularly in a region important in memor y, known as the hippocampus. Their function in the brain is unknown. When the cells are removed from the brain of mice and grown in tissue culture, their proliferation and differentiation can be influenced by various growth factors.  What Is Known About Adult Stem Cells?  To date, published scientific papers indicate that adult stem cells have been identified in brain, bone marrow, peripheral blood, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, epithelia of the skin and digestive system, cornea, dental pulp of the tooth, retina, liver, and pancreas. Thus, adult stem cells have been found in tissues that develop from all three embr yonic germ layers.  There is no evidence of an adult stem cell that is pluripotent. It has not been demonstrated that one adult stem cell can be directed to develop into any cell type of the body. That is, no adult stem cell has been shown to be capable of developing into cells from all three embr yonic germ layers.  In the body, adult stem cells can proliferate without differentiating for a long period (the characteristic referred to as long-term self-renewal),  ES-6   Executive Summar y   Current methods for characterizing adult stem cells depend on determining cell-sur face markers and making obser vations about their differentiation patterns in culture dishes.  Some adult stem cells appear to have the capability to differentiate into tissues other than the ones from which they originated; this is referred to as plasticity. Reports of human or mouse adult stem cells that demonstrate plasticity and the cells they differentiate or specialize into include: 1) blood and bone marrow (unpurified hematopoietic) stem cells differentiate into the 3 major types of brain cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and liver cells; 2) bone marrow (stromal) cells differentiates into cardiac muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells, fat, bone, and cartilage; and 3) brain stem cells differentiate into blood cells and skeletal muscle cells.  Ver y few published research reports on the plasticity of adult stem cells shown that a single, identified adult stem cell can give rise to a differentiated cell type of another tissue. That is, there is limited evidence that a single adult stem cell or genetically identical line of adult stem cells demonstrates plasticity. Researchers believe that it is most likely that a variety of populations of stem cells may be responsible for the phenomena of developing multiple cell types.  A few experiments have shown plasticity of adult stem cells by demonstrating the development of mature, fully functional cells in tissues other than which they were derived and the restoration of lost or diminished function in an animal model. What is Known About Human Pluripotent Stem Cells?  Since 1998, research teams have refined the techniques for growing human pluripotent cells in culture systems. Collectively, the studies indicate that it is now possible to grow these cells for up to two years in a chemically defined medium.  The cell lines have been shown to have a normal number of chromosomes and they generate cell types that originate from all three primar y germ layers.  Cultures of human pluripotent stem cells have active telomerase, which is an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres and is  important for cells to maintain their capacity to replicate. Human pluripotent stem cells appear to maintain relatively long telomeres, indicating that they have the ability to replicate for many, many generations.  Evidence of structural, genetic, and functional cells characteristic of specialized cells developed from cultured human and mouse embr yonic stem cells has been shown for: 1) Pancreatic islet-cell like cells that secrete insulin (mouse and human); 2) cardiac muscle cells with contractile activity (mouse and human); 3) blood cells (human and mouse); 4) ner ve cells that produce certain brain chemicals (mouse).  At the time of this report, there are approximately 30 cell lines of human pluripotent stem cells that have been derived from human blastocysts or fetal tissue.  Overall, it appears human embr yonic cells and embr yonic germ cells are not equivalent in their potential to proliferate or differentiate.  What are Some of the Questions that Need to be Answered about Stem Cells?  What are the mechanisms that allow human embr yonic stem cells and embr yonic germ cells to proliferate in vitro without differentiating?  What are the intrinsic controls that keep stem cells from differentiating?  Is there a universal stem cell? That is, could a kind of stem cell exist (possibly circulating in the blood) that can generate the cells of any organ or tissue?  Do adult stem cells exhibit plasticity as a normal event in the body or is it an artifact of the culture conditions? If plasticity occurs normally, is it a characteristic of all adult stem cells? What are the signals that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells that demonstrate plasticity?  What are the factors responsible for stem cells to "" home"" to sites of injur y or damage?  What are the intrinsic controls that direct stem cells along a particular differentiation pathway to form one specialized cell over another? How are such intrinsic regulators, in turn, influenced by the  ES-7   Executive Summar y  microenvironment, or niche, where stem cells normally reside?  Will the knowledge about the genetic mechanisms regulating the specialization of embr yonic cells into cells from all embr yonic germ layers during development enable the scientists to engineer adult stem cells to do the same?  What are the sources of adult stem cells in the body? Are they "" leftover "" embr yonic stem cells, or do they arise in some other way? And if the latter is true--which seems to be the case-- exactly how do adult stem cells arise, and why do they remain in an undifferentiated state when all the cells around them have differentiated?  How many kinds of adult stem cells exist, and in which tissues do they exist?  Is it possible to manipulate adult stem cells to increase their ability to proliferate in a culture dish so that adult stem cells can be used as a sufficient source of tissue for transplants?  Does the genetic programming status of stem cells play a significant role in maintaining the cells, directing their differentiation, or determining their suitability for transplant?  Are the human embr yonic stem and germ cells that appear to be homogeneous and undifferentiated in culture, in fact, homogeneous and undifferentiated? Or are they heterogeneous and/or "" partially "" differentiated?  What are the cellular and molecular signals that are important in activating a human pluripotent stem cell to begin differentiating into a specialized cell type?  Will analysis of genes from human pluripotent stem cells reveal a common mechanism that maintains cells in an undifferentiated state?  Do all pluripotent stem cells pass through a progenitor/precursor cell stage while becoming specialized? If so, can a precursor or progenitor cell stage be maintained as optimal cells for therapeutic transplantation?  What stage of differentiation of stem cells will be best for transplantation? Would the same stage be optimal for all transplantation applications, or will it differ on a case-by-case basis?  What differentiation stages of stem cells would be best for screening drugs or toxins, or for delivering potentially therapeutic drugs?  COMPARISONS OF ADULT STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS Biomedical research on stem cells is at an early stage, but is advancing rapidly. After many years of isolating and characterizing these cells, researchers are just now beginning to employ stem cells as discover y tools and a basis for potential therapies. This new era of research affords an opportunity to use what has already been learned to explore the similarities and differences of adult and embr yonic stem cells. (In this discussion, comments about embr yonic stem cells derived from human embr yos, and embr yonic germ cells derived from fetal tissue, will be referred to equally as embr yonic stem cells, unless other wise distinguished.)  How are Adult and Embr yonic Stem Cells Similar? By definition, stem cells have in common the ability to self-replicate and to give rise to specialized cells and tissues (such as cells of the heart, brain, bone, etc.) that have specific functions. In most cases, stem cells can be isolated and maintained in an unspecialized state. Scientists use similar techniques (i.e., cell-sur face markers and monitoring the expression of certain genes) to identify or characterize stem cells as being unspecialized. Scientists then use different genetic or molecular markers to determine that the cells have differentiated--a process that might be compared to distinguishing a particular cell type by reading its cellular barcode. Stem cells from both adult and embr yonic sources can proliferate and specialize when transplanted into an animal with a compromised immune system. (Immune-deficient animals are less likely to reject the transplanted tissue). Scientists also have evidence that differentiated cells generated from either stem cell type, when injected or transplanted into an animal model of disease or injur y, undergo "" homing,"" a process whereby the transplanted cells are attracted by and travel to the injured site. Similarly, researchers are finding that the cellular and non-cellular ""environment "" into which stem cell-derived tissues are placed (e.g., whether they are grown in a culture dish or transplanted into an animal) prominently influences how the cells differentiate. Another important area that requires substantially more research concerns the immunologic characteristics of  ES-8   Executive Summar y  human adult and embr yonic stem cells. If any of these stem cells are to be used as the basis for therapy, it is critical understand how the body 's immune system will respond to the transplantation of tissue derived from these cells. At this time, there is no clear advantage of one stem cell source over the other in this regard.  potential as embr yonic stem and germ cells? To date, there are no definitive answers to these questions, and the answers that do exist are sometimes conflicting. These sources of stem cells do not seem to have the same ability to proliferate in culture and at the same time retain the capacity to differentiate into functionally useful cells. Human embr yonic stem cells can be generated in abundant quantities in the laborator y and can be grown (allowed to proliferate) in their undifferentiated (or unspecialized) state for many, many generations. From a practical perspective in basic research or eventual clinical application, it is significant that millions of cells can be generated from one embr yonic stem cell in the laborator y. In many cases, however, researchers have had difficulty finding laborator y conditions under which some adult stem cells can proliferate without becoming specialized. This problem is most pronounced with hematopoietic stem cells isolated from blood or bone marrow. These cells when cultured in the laborator y either fail to proliferate or do so to a limited extent, although they do proliferate if transplanted into an animal or human. This technical barrier to proliferation has limited the ability of researchers to explore the capacity of certain types of adult stem cells to generate sufficient numbers of specialized cells for transplantation purposes. These differences in culturing conditions contribute to the contrasts in the experimental systems used to evaluate the ability to become specialized under particular laborator y conditions. Much of the information on the directed differentiation of embr yonic stem cells into cells with specialized function comes from studying mouse or human embr yonic cell lines grown in laborator y culture dishes. In contrast, most knowledge about the differentiation of adult stem cells differentiation are from obser vations of cells and tissues in animal models in which mixtures of cells have been implanted. Stem cells also differ in their capacity to specialize into various cell and tissue types. Current evidence indicates that the capability of adult stem cells to give rise to many different specialized cell types is more limited than that of embr yonic stem cells. A single embr yonic stem cell has been shown to give rise to specialized cells from all three embr yonic layers. However, it has not yet been shown that a  How are Adult and Embr yonic Stem Cells Different? Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of embr yonic stem cells and adult stem cells is their source. Most scientists now agree that adult stem cells exist in many tissues of the human body (in vivo), although the cells are quite rare. In contrast, it is less certain that embr yonic stem cells exist as such in the embr yo. Instead, embr yonic stem cells and embr yonic germ cells develop in tissue culture after they are derived from the inner cell mass of the early embr yo or from the gonadal ridge tissue of the fetus, respectively. Depending on the culture conditions, embr yonic stem cells may form clumps of cells that can differentiate spontaneously to generate many cell types. This property has not been obser ved in cultures of adult stem cells. Also, if undifferentiated embr yonic stem cells are removed from the culture dish and injected into a mouse with a compromised immune system, a benign tumor called a teratoma can develop. A teratoma typically contains a mixture of partially differentiated cell types. For this reason, scientists do not anticipate that undifferentiated embr yonic stem cells will be used for transplants or other therapeutic applications. It is not known whether similar results are obser ved with adult stem cells. Stem cells in adult tissues do not appear to have the same capacity to differentiate as do embr yonic stem cells or embr yonic germ cells. Embr yonic stem and germ cells are clearly pluripotent; they can differentiate into any tissues derived from all three germ layers of the embr yo (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). But are adult stem cells also pluripotent? When they reside in their normal tissue compartments--the brain, the bone marrow, the epithelial lining of the gut, etc.--they produce the cells that are specific to that kind of tissue and they have been found in tissues derived from all three embr yonic layers. But can adult stem cells be taken out of their normal environment and be manipulated or other wise induced to have the same differentiation  ES-9   Executive Summar y  single adult stem cell can give rise to specialized cells derived from all three embr yonic germ cell layers. Therefore, a single adult stem cell has not been shown to have the same degree of pluripotency as embr yonic stem cells.  experiments with different animal models or, in this case, different cell lines. However, there have been ver y few studies that compare various stem cell lines with each other. It may be that one source proves better for certain applications, and a different cell source proves better for others. For researchers and patients, there are many practical questions about stem cells that cannot yet be answered. How long will it take to develop therapies for Parkinson's Disease and diabetes with and without human pluripotent stem cells? Can the full range of new therapeutic approaches be developed using only adult stem cells? How many different sources of stem cells will be needed to generate the best treatments in the shortest period of time? Predicting the future of stem cell applications is impossible, particularly given the ver y early stage of the science of stem cell biology. To date, it is impossible to predict which stem cells--those derived from the embr yo, the fetus, or the adult--or which methods for manipulating the cells, will best meet the needs of basic research and clinical applications. The answers clearly lie in conducting more research.  CONCLUSIONS Two important points about embr yonic and adult stem cells have emerged so far: the cells are different and present immense research opportunities for potential therapy. As research goes for ward, scientists will undoubtedly find other similarities and differences between adult and embr yonic stem cells. During the next several years, it will be important to compare embr yonic stem cells and adult stem cells in terms of their ability to proliferate, differentiate, sur vive and function after transplant, and avoid immune rejection. Investigators have shown that differentiated cells generated from both adult and embr yonic stem cells can repair or replace damaged cells and tissues in animal studies. Scientists upon making new discoveries often verify reported results in different laboratories and under different conditions. Similarly, they will often conduct  ES-10"

THE HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL AND THE HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELL  A new era in stem cell biology began in 1998 with the derivation of cells from human blastocysts and fetal tissue with the unique ability of differentiating into cells of all tissues in the body, i.e., the cells are pluripotent. Since then, several research teams have characterized many of the molecular characteristics of these cells and improved the methods for culturing them. In addition, scientists are just beginning to direct the differentiation of the human pluripotent stem cells and to identify the functional capabilities of the resulting specialized cells. Although in its earliest phases, research with these cells is proving to be important to developing innovative cell replacement strategies to rebuild tissues and restore critical functions of the diseased or damaged human body.  culture of ES cells from the blastocysts of rhesus monkeys [46] and marmosets [47], and methods used by IVF clinics to prepare human embr yos for transplanting into the uterus to produce a live birth [11, 49].  TIMELINE OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH  1878: First reported attempts to fertilize mammalian eggs outside the body [49].  1959: First report of animals (rabbits) produced through IVF in the United States [49].  1960s: Studies of teratocarcinomas in the testes of several inbred strains of mice indicates they originated from embr yonic germ cells. The work establishes embr yonal carcinoma (EC) cells as a kind of stem cell [17, 24]. For a more detailed discussion of human embr yonal carcinoma cells, see Appendix C.  1968: Edwards and Bavister fertilize the first human egg in vitro [49].  1970s: EC cells injected into mouse blastocysts produce chimeric mice. Cultured SC cells are explored as models of embr yonic development, although their complement of chromosomes is abnormal [25].  1978: Louise Brown, the first IVF baby, is born in England [49].  1980: Australia's first IVF baby, Candace Reed, is born in Melbourne [49].  1981: Evans and Kaufman, and Martin derive mouse embr yonic stem (ES) cells from the inner cell mass of blastocysts. They establish culture conditions for growing pluripotent mouse ES cells in vitro. The ES cells yield cell lines with normal, diploid kar yotyes and generate derivatives of all three primar y germ layers as well as primordial  OVERVIEW In 1998, James Thomson and his colleagues reported methods for deriving and maintaining human embr yonic stem (ES) cells from the inner cell mass of human blastocysts that were produced through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and donated for research purposes [46]. At the same time, another group, led by John Gearhart, reported the derivation of cells that they identified as embr yonic germ (EG) cells. The cells were cultured from primordial germ cells obtained from the gonadal ridge and mesenchyma of 5- to 9-week fetal tissue that resulted from elective abortions [41]. The two research teams developed their methods for culturing human ES and EG cells by drawing on a host of animal studies, some of which date back almost 40 years: derivations of pluripotent mouse ES cells from blastocysts [13, 15], reports of the derivation of EG cells [27, 36], experiments with stem cells derived from mouse teratocarcinomas [24] and human embr yonal carcinomas and teratocarcinomas [4, 17, 24], the derivation and  11   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  germ cells. Injecting the ES cells into mice induces the formation of teratomas [15, 26]. The first IVF baby, Elizabeth Carr, is born in the United States [49].  1984-88: Andrews et al., develop pluripotent, genetically identical (clonal) cells called embr yonal carcinoma (EC) cells from Tera-2, a cell line of human testicular teratocarcinoma [5]. Cloned human teratoma cells exposed to retinoic acid differentiate into neuron-like cells and other cell types [3, 44].  1989: Pera et al., derive a clonal line of human embr yonal carcinoma cells, which yields tissues from all three primar y germ layers. The cells are aneuploid (fewer or greater than the normal number of chromosomes in the cell) and their potential to differentiate spontaneously in vitro is typically limited. The behavior of human EC cell clones differs from that of mouse ES or EC cells [33].  1994: Human blastocysts created for reproductive purposes using IVF and donated by patients for research, are generated from the 2-pronuclear stage. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst is maintained in culture and generates aggregates with trophoblast-like cells at the peripher y and ES-like cells in the center. The cells retain a complete set of chromosomes (normal kar yotype); most cultures retain a stem cell-like morphology, although some inner cell mass clumps differentiate into fibroblasts. The cultures are maintained for two passages [6, 7].  1995-96: Non-human primate ES cells are derived and maintained in vitro, first from the inner cell mass of rhesus monkeys [46], and then from marmosets [47]. The primate ES cells are diploid and have normal kar yotypes. They are pluripotent and differentiate into cells types derived from all three primar y germ layers. The primate ES cells resemble human EC cells and indicate that it should be possible to derive and maintain human ES cells in vitro.  1998: Thomson et al., derive human ES cells from the inner cell mass of normal human blastocysts donated by couples undergoing treatment for infertility. The cells are cultured through many passages, retain their normal kar yotypes, maintain high levels of telomerase activity, and express a panel of markers typical  of human EC cells non-human primate ES cells. Several (non-clonal) cell lines are established that form teratomas when injected into immune-deficient mice. The teratomas include cell types derived from all three primar y germ layers, demonstrating the pluripotency of human ES cells [48]. Gearhart and colleagues derive human embr yonic germ (EG) cells from the gonadal ridge and mesenchyma of 5- to 9-week fetal tissue that resulted from elective abortions. They grow EG cells in vitro for approximately 20 passages, and the cells maintain normal kar yotypes. The cells spontaneously form aggregates that differentiate spontaneously, and ultimately contain derivatives of all three primar y germ layers. Other indications of their pluripotency include the expression of a panel of markers typical of mouse ES and EG cells. The EG cells do not form teratomas when injected into immune-deficient mice [41].  2000: Scientists in Singapore and Australia led by Pera, Trounson, and Bongso derive human ES cells from the inner cell mass of blastocysts donated by couples undergoing treatment for infertility. The ES cells proliferate for extended periods in vitro, maintain normal kar yotypes, differentiate spontaneously into somatic cell lineages derived from all three primar y germ layers, and form teratomas when injected into immune-deficient mice.  2001: As human ES cell lines are shared and new lines are derived, more research groups report methods to direct the differentiation of the cells in vitro. Many of the methods are aimed at generating human tissues for transplantation purposes, including pancreatic islet cells, neurons that release dopamine, and cardiac muscle cells.  DERIVATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS The first documentation of the isolation of embr yonic stem cells from human blastocysts was in 1994 [7]. Since then, techniques for deriving and culturing human ES cells have been refined [38, 48]. The ability to isolate human ES cells from blastocysts and grow them in culture seems to depend in large part on the integrity and condition of the blastocyst from which the cells are derived. In general, blastocysts with a  12   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  large and distinct inner cell mass tend to yield ES cultures most efficiently [11] (see Figure 3.1. Human Blastocyst Showing Inner Cell Mass and Trophectoderm). Timeline for the Development of a Human  more detailed discussion, see Appendix A. Early Development.) Many IVF clinics now transfer day-5 embr yos to the uterus for optimal implantation, a stage of development that more closely parallels the stage at which a blastocyst would implant in the wall of the uterus in vivo. This represents a change--and a greatly improved implantation rate--from earlier IVF procedures in which a 2-cell embr yo was used for implantation. Day-5 blastocysts are used to derive ES cell cultures. A normal day-5 human embr yo in vitro consists of 200 to 250 cells. Most of the cells comprise the trophectoderm. For deriving ES cell cultures, the trophectoderm is removed, either by microsurger y or immunosurger y (in which antibodies against the trophectoderm help break it down, thus freeing the inner cell mass). At this stage, the inner cell mass is composed of only 30 to 34 cells [10].  Photo Credit: Mr. J. Conaghan  Figure 3.1. Human Blastocyst Showing Inner Cell Mass and Trophectoderm.  The in vitro conditions for growing a human embr yo to the blastocyst stage var y among IVF clinics and are reviewed elsewhere [6, 8, 14, 16, 18, 21, 39, 49, 50]. However, once the inner cell mass is obtained from either mouse or human blastocysts, the techniques for growing ES cells are similar. (For a detailed discussion see Appendix C. Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells.)  Blastocyst In Vitro After a human oocyte is fertilized in vitro by a sperm cell, the following events occur according to a fairly predictable timeline [9, 12, 16]. At 18 to 24 hours after in vitro fertilization of the oocyte is considered day 1. By day 2 (24 to 25 hours), the zygote (fertilized egg) undergoes the first cleavage to produce a 2-cell embr yo. By day 3 (72 hours), the embr yo reaches the 8-cell stage called a morula. It is at this stage that the genome of the embr yo begins to control its own development. This means that any maternal influences--due to the presence of mRNA and proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm--are significantly reduced. By day 4, the cells of the embr yo adhere tightly to each other in a process known as compaction and by day 5, the cavity of the blastocyst is completed. The inner cell mass begins to separate from the outer cells, which become the trophectoderm that surrounds the blastocyst. This represents the first obser vable sign of cell differentiation in the embr yo. (For a  DERIVATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS As stated earlier, human embr yonic germ (EG) cells share many of the characteristics of human ES cells, but differ in significant ways. Human EG cells are derived from the primordial germ cells, which occur in a specific part of the embr yo/fetus called the gonadal ridge, and which normally develop into mature gametes (eggs and sperm). Gearhart and his collaborators devised methods for growing pluripotent cells derived from human EG cells. The process requires the generation of embr yoid bodies from EG cells, which consists of an unpredictable mix of partially differentiated cell types [19]. The embr yoid body-derived cells resulting from this process have high proliferative capacity and gene expression patterns that are representative of multiple cell lineages. This suggests that the embr yoid bodyderived cells are progenitor or precursor cells for  13   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  a variety of differentiated cell types [19]. (For a more detailed description of the derivation of EG cells, see Appendix C. Human Embr yonic Stem Cells and Human Embr yonic Germ Cells.)  COMPARISONS BETWEEN HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS The ES cells derived from human blastocysts by Thomson and his colleagues, and from human EG cells derived by Gearhart and his collaborators, are similar in many respects. In both cases, the cells replicate for an extended period of time, show no chromosomal abnormalities, generate both XX (female) and XY (male) cultures, and express a set of markers regarded as characteristic of pluripotent cells. When the culture conditions are adjusted to permit differentiation (see below for details), both ES and EG cells spontaneously differentiate into derivatives of all three primar y germ layers-- endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm (see Table 3.1. Comparison of Mouse, Monkey, and Human Pluripotent Stem Cells). However, the ES cells derived from human blastocysts and EG cells differ not only in the tissue sources from which they are derived, they also var y with respect to their growth characteristics in vitro, and their behavior in vivo [34]. In addition, human ES cells have been propagated for approximately two years in vitro, for several hundred population doublings [1], whereas human embr yoid body-derived cells from cultures of embr yonic germ cells have been maintained for only 70 to 80 population doublings [42]. Also, human ES cells will generate teratomas containing differentiated cell types, if injected into immunocompromised mice colonies, while human EG cells will not [20, 37, 38, 41, 48]. Several research groups are tr ying to grow human ES cells without feeder layers of mouse embr yo fibroblasts (MEF), which are labor-intensive to generate. At a recent meeting, scientists from the Geron Corporation reported that they have grown human ES cell without feeder layers, in medium conditioned by MEFs and supplemented with basic FGF [51].  PLURIPOTENCY OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS As stated earlier, a truly pluripotent stem cell is a cell that is capable of self-renewal and of differentiating into most all of the cells of the body, including cells of all three germ layers. Human ES and EG cells in vitro are capable of long-term self-renewal, while retaining a normal kar yotype [1, 38, 41, 42, 48]. Human ES cells can proliferate for two years through 300 population doublings [29] or even 450 population doublings [30]. Cultures derived from embr yoid bodies generated by human embr yonic germ cells have less capacity for proliferation. Most will proliferate for 40 population doublings; the maximum reported is 70 to 80 population doublings [42]. To date, several laboratories have demonstrated that human ES cells in vitro are pluripotent; they can produce cell types derived from all three embr yonic germ layers [1, 20, 38, 40]. Currently, the only test of the in vivo pluripotency of human ES cells is to inject them into immunedeficient mice where they generate differentiated cells that are derived from all three germ layers. These include gut epithelium (which, in the embr yo, is derived from endoderm); smooth and striated muscle (derived from mesoderm); and neural epithelium, and stratified squamous epithelium (derived from ectoderm) [20, 38, 48]. However, two aspects of in vivo pluripotency typically used in animals have not been met by human ES cells: evidence that cells have the capacity to be injected into a human embr yo and form an organism made up of cells from two genetic lineages; and evidence that they have the ability to generate germ cells, the precursors to eggs and sperm in a developing organism. These are theoretical considerations, however, because such tests using human ES cells have not been conducted. In any case, these two demonstrations of human ES cell pluripotency are not likely to be critical for potential therapeutic uses of the cells--in transplants or drug development, for example [43].  DIRECTED DIFFERENTIATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS AND EMBRYONIC GERM CELLS IN VITRO Currently, a major goal for embr yonic stem cell research is to control the differentiation of human ES and EG cell lines into specific kinds of cells--an  14   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  Table 3.1.

The techniques now being tested to direct human ES cell differentiation are borrowed directly from techniques used to direct the differentiation of mouse ES cells in vitro. For more discussion on directed differentiation of human ES and EG cells see Appendix C.  POTENTIAL USES OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS Many uses have been proposed for human embr yonic stem cells. The most-often discussed is their potential use in transplant therapy--i.e., to replace or restore tissue that has been damaged by disease or injur y (see also Chapters 5-9).  15   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  Using Human Embr yonic Stem Cells for Therapeutic Transplants Diseases that might be treated by transplanting human ES-derived cells include Parkinson's disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injur y, Purkinje cell degeneration, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, heart  failure, and osteogenesis imper fecta. However, treatments for any of these diseases require that human ES cells be directed to differentiate into specific cell types prior to transplant. The research is occurring in several laboratories, but is limited because so few laboratories have access to human ES cells. Thus, at  Human ES Cells  Establish pure cultures of specific cell type   Lineage selection by cell sur vival or cell sor ting (e.g., insulin promoter driving antibiotic resistance gene or GFP)  Induce with supplemental growth factor(s) or inducer cells (e.g., retinoic acid for neural cells)  Test physiologic function  In vitro (e.g., stimulated insulin release)  Demonstrate efficacy  In rodent models  In non-human primate model with rhesus ES cell-derived cells (e.g., diabetes and Parkinson's disease models in primates)  Evaluate integration into host tissue (e.g., cardiomyocytes for treatment of hear t failure)  ? recurrent autoimmunity (e.g., diabetes)  Demonstrate safety  In non-human primate model with rhesus ES cell-derived tissues  Show absence of tumor formation  Show absence of transmission of infectious agents  Test methods to prevent rejection  Multi-drug immunosuppression  Create differentiated cells isogenic to prospective recipient using nuclear reprogramming  Transduce ES cells to express recipient MHC genes  Establish hematopoietic chimera and immunologic tolerance  Human trials  Figure 3.2. Major Goals in the Development of Transplantation Therapies from Human ES Cell Lines. (Reproduced with permission from Stem Cells, 2001)  16   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  this stage, any therapies based on the use of human ES cells are still hypothetical and highly experimental [22, 29, 31] (see Figure 3.2. Major Goals in the Development of Transplantation Therapies from Human ES Cell Lines). One of the current advantages of using ES cells as compared to adult stem cells is that ES cells have an unlimited ability to proliferate in vitro, and are more likely to be able to generate a broad range of cell types through directed differentiation. Ultimately, it will also be necessar y to both identify the optimal stage(s) of differentiation for transplant, and demonstrate that the transplanted ES-derived cells can sur vive, integrate, and function in the recipient. The potential disadvantages of the use of human ES cells for transplant therapy include the propensity of undifferentiated ES cells to induce the formation of tumors (teratomas), which are typically benign. Because it is the undifferentiated cells--rather than their differentiated progeny--that have been shown to induce teratomas, tumor formation might be avoided by devising methods for removing any undifferentiated ES cells prior to transplant. Also, it should be possible to devise a fail-safe mechanism-- i.e., to insert into transplanted ES-derived cells suicide genes that can trigger the death of the cells should they become tumorigenic. Human ES derived cells would also be advantageous for transplantation purposes if they did not trigger immune rejection. The immunological status of human ES cells has not been studied in detail, and it is not known how immunogenic ES-derived cells might be. In general, the immunogenicity of a cell depends on its expression of Class I major histocompatability antigens (MHC), which allow the body to distinguish its own cells from foreign tissue, and on the presence of cells that can bind to foreign antigens and "" present "" them to the immune system. The potential immunological rejection of human ES-derived cells might be avoided by genetically engineering the ES cells to express the MHC antigens of the transplant recipient, or by using nuclear transfer technology to generate ES cells that are genetically identical to the person who receives the transplant. It has been suggested that this could be accomplished by using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology (so-called therapeutic cloning) in which the nucleus is removed from one of the transplant  patient 's cells, such as a skin cell, and injecting the nucleus into an oocyte. The oocyte, thus "" fertilized,"" could be cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. ES cells could subsequently be derived from its inner cell mass, and directed to differentiate into the desired cell type. The result would be differentiated (or partly differentiated) ES-derived cells that match exactly the immunological profile of the person who donated the somatic cell nucleus, and who is also the intended recipient of the transplant--a labor intensive, but truly customized therapy [29]. Other Potential Uses of Human Embr yonic Stem Cells Many potential uses of human ES cells have been proposed that do not involve transplantation. For example, human ES cells could be used to study early events in human development. Still-unexplained events in early human development can result in congenital birth defects and placental abnormalities that lead to spontaneous abortion. By studying human ES cells in vitro, it may be possible to identify the genetic, molecular, and cellular events that lead to these problems and identify methods for preventing them [22, 35, 45]. Such cells could also be used to explore the effects of chromosomal abnormalities in early development. This might include the ability to monitor the development of early childhood tumors, many of which are embr yonic in origin [32]. Human ES cells could also be used to test candidate therapeutic drugs. Currently, before candidate drugs are tested in human volunteers, they are subjected to a barrage of preclinical tests. These include drug screening in animal models--in vitro tests using cells derived from mice or rats, for example, or in vivo tests that involve giving the drug to an animal to assess its safety. Although animal model testing is a mainstay of pharmaceutical research, it cannot always predict the effects that a candidate drug may have on human cells. For this reason, cultures of human cells are often employed in preclinical tests. These human cell lines have usually been maintained in vitro for long periods and as such often have different characteristics than do in vivo cells. These differences can make it difficult to predict the action of a drug in vivo based on the response of human cell lines in vitro. Therefore, if human ES cells can be directed to differentiate into specific cell types that are important  17   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  A.

(Reproduced with permission from Stem Cells, 2001)  for drug screening, the ES-derived cells may be more likely to mimic the in vivo response of the cells/tissues to the drug(s) being tested and so offer safer, and potentially cheaper, models for drug screening. Human ES cells could be employed to screen potential toxins. The reasons for using human ES cells to screen potential toxins closely resemble those for using human ES-derived cells to test drugs (above). Toxins often have different effects on different animal species, which makes it critical to have the best possible in vitro models for evaluating their effects on human cells. Finally, human ES cells could be used to develop new methods for genetic engineering (see Figure 3.3. Genetic Manipulation of Human Embr yonic Stem Cells). Currently, the genetic complement of mouse ES cells in vitro can be modified easily by techniques such as homologous recombination. This is a method for replacing or adding genes, which requires that a DNA molecule be artificially introduced into the genome and then expressed. Using this method, genes to direct differentiation to a specific cell type or genes that express a desired protein product might be introduced into the ES cell line. Ultimately, if such techniques could be developed using human ES  cells, it may be possible to devise better methods for gene therapy [35] (see Chapter 10. Assessing Human Stem Cell Safety).  SUMMARY What Do We Know About Human Embr yonic Stem Cells? Since 1998, research teams have refined the techniques for growing human ES cells in vitro [1, 20, 38]. Collectively, the studies indicate that it is now possible to grow human ES cells for more than a year in serum-free medium on feeder layers. The cells have normal kar yotype and are pluripotent; they generate teratomas that contain differentiated cell types derived from all three primar y germ layers. The long-term cultures of human ES cells have active telomerase and maintain relatively long telomeres, another marker of proliferating cells. Overall, the pluripotent cells that can be generated in vitro from human ES cells and human EG cells are apparently not equivalent in their potential to proliferate or differentiate. (ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the preimplantation blastocyst, approximately 5 days post-fertilization, whereas human EG cells are derived from fetal primordial  18   The Human Embr yonic Stem Cell and The Human Embr yonic Germ Cell  germ cells, 5 to 10 weeks post-fertilization.) ES cells can proliferate for up to 300 population doublings, while cells derived from embr yoid bodies that are generated from embr yonic germ cells (fetal tissue) double a maximum of 70 to 80 times in vitro. ES cells appear to have a broader ability to differentiate. Both kinds of cells spontaneously generate neural precursor-type cells (widely regarded as a default pathway for differentiation), and both generate cells that resemble cardiac myocytes [19, 45]. However, human ES and EG cells in vitro will spontaneously generate embr yoid bodies that consist of cell types from all three primar y germ layers [1, 20, 38, 42]. What Do We Need To Know About Human Embr yonic Stem Cells? Scientists are just beginning to understand the biology of human embr yonic stem cells, and many key questions remain unanswered or only partly answered. For example, in order to refine and improve ES cell culture systems, it is important that scientists identify the mechanisms that allow human ES cells in vitro to proliferate without differentiating [29]. Once the mechanisms that regulate human ES proliferation are known, it will likely be possible to apply this knowledge to the long-standing challenge of improving the in vitro self-renewal capabilities of adult stem cells. It will also be important to determine whether the genetic imprinting status of human ES cells plays any significant role in maintaining the cells, directing their differentiation, or determining their suitability for transplant. One of the effects of growing mouse blastocysts in culture is a change in the methylation of specific genes that control embr yonic growth and development [23]. Do similar changes in gene imprinting patterns occur in human ES cells (or blastocysts)? If so, what is their effect on in vitro development and on any differentiated cell types that may be derived from cultured ES cells? Efforts will need to be made to determine whether cultures of human ES cells that appear to be homogeneous and undifferentiated are, in fact, homogeneous and undifferentiated. Is it possible that human ES cells in vitro cycle in and out of partially differentiated states? And if that occurs, how will it affect attempts to direct their differentiation or maintain the cells in a proliferating state [28]?  Scientists will need to identify which signal transduction pathways must be activated to induce human ES cell differentiation along a particular pathway. This includes understanding ligand-receptor interaction and the intracellular components of the signaling system, as well as identifying the genes that are activated or inactivated during differentiation of specific cell types [29]. Identifying intermediate stages of human ES cell differentiation will also be important. As human ES cells differentiate in vitro, do they form distinct precursor or progenitor cells that can be identified and isolated? If ES cells do form such intermediate cell types, can the latter be maintained and expanded? Would such precursor or progenitor cells be useful for therapeutic transplantation [19]? Finally, scientists will need to determine what differentiation stages of human ES-derived cells are optimal for other practical applications. For example, what differentiation stages of ES-derived cells would be best for screening drugs or toxins, or for delivering potentially therapeutic drugs?  REFERENCES 1.

GX229-56-2685703	"2. THE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL As stated in the first chapter, an embr yonic stem cell (ES cell) is defined by its origin. It is derived from the blastocyst stage of the embr yo. The blastocyst is the stage of embr yonic development prior to implantation in the uterine wall. At this stage, the preimplantation embr yo of the mouse is made up of 150 cells and consists of a sphere made up of an outer layer of cells (the trophectoderm), a fluid-filled cavity (the blastocoel), and a cluster of cells on the interior (the inner cell mass). Studies of ES cells derived from mouse blastocysts became possible 20 years ago with the discover y of techniques that allowed the cells to be grown in the laborator y. Embr yoniclike stem cells, called embr yonic germ (EG) cells, can also be derived from primordial germ (PG) cells (the cells of the developing fetus from which eggs and sperm are formed) of the mouse [20] and human fetus [30]. In this chapter the discussion will be limited to mouse embr yonic stem cells. Chapter 3 describes the human embr yonic stem cell. For research purposes, the definition of an ES cell is more than a self-replicating stem cell derived from the embr yo that can differentiate into almost all of the cells of the body. Scientists have found it necessar y to develop specific criteria that help them better define the ES cell. Austin Smith, whose studies of mouse ES cells have contributed significantly to the field, has offered a list of essential characteristics that define ES cells [18, 32].  DEFINING PROPERTIES OF AN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL  a Derived from the inner cell mass/epiblast of the blastocyst.  a Capable of undergoing an unlimited number of symmetrical divisions without differentiating (long-term self-renewal).  Exhibit and maintain a stable, full (diploid), normal complement of chromosomes (kar yotype).  Pluripotent ES cells can give rise to differentiated cell types that are derived from all three primar y germ layers of the embr yo (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm).  Capable of integrating into all fetal tissues during development. (Mouse ES cells maintained in culture for long periods can still generate any tissue when they are reintroduced into an embr yo to generate a chimeric animal.) Capable of colonizing the germ line and giving rise to egg or sperm cells. a,b a,b  DO EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS ACTUALLY OCCUR IN THE EMBRYO? Some scientists argue that ES cells do not occur in the embr yo as such. ES cells closely resemble the cells of the preimplantation embr yo [3], but are not in fact the same [32]. An alternative perspective is that the embr yos of many animal species contain stem cells. These cells proliferate extensively in the embr yo, are capable of differentiating into all the types of cells that occur in the adult, and can be isolated and grown ex vivo (outside the organism), where they continue to replicate and show the potential to differentiate [18].     aClonogenic, that is a single ES cell can give rise to a colony of genetically identical cells, or clones, which have the same properties as the original cell.  5   The Embr yonic Stem Cell   Expresses the transcription factor Oct-4, which then activates or inhibits a host of target genes and maintains ES cells in a proliferative, nondifferentiating state.  Can be induced to continue proliferating or to differentiate.  Lacks the G1 checkpoint in the cell cycle. ES cells spend most of their time in the S phase of the cell cycle, during which they synthesize DNA. Unlike differentiated somatic cells, ES cells do not require any external stimulus to initiate DNA replication.  Do not show X inactivation. In ever y somatic cell of a female mammal, one of the two X chromosomes becomes permanently inactivated. X inactivation does not occur in undifferentiated ES cells. [a Not shown in human EG cells. b Not shown in human ES cells. All of the criteria have been met by mouse ES cells.]  cells from one culture dish and replating them into fresh culture dishes. Whether the number of passages affects the differentiation potential of human ES cells remains to be determined. (For a detailed discussion of the techniques for maintaining mouse ES cells in culture, see Appendix B. Mouse Embr yonic Stem Cells.) A second method for determining the pluripotency of mouse ES cells is to inject the cells into adult mice (under the skin or the kidney capsule) that are either genetically identical or are immune-deficient, so the tissue will not be rejected. In the host animal, the injected ES cells develop into benign tumors called teratomas. When examined under a microscope, it was noted that these tumors contain cell types derived from all three primar y germ layers of the embr yo--endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Teratomas typically contain gut-like structures such as layers of epithelial cells and smooth muscle; skeletal or cardiac muscle (which may contract spontaneously); neural tissue; cartilage or bone; and sometimes hair. Thus, ES cells that have been maintained for a long period in vitro can behave as pluripotent cells in vivo. They can participate in normal embr yogenesis by differentiating into any cell type in the body, and they can also differentiate into a wide range of cell types in an adult animal. However, normal mouse ES cells do not generate trophoblast tissues in vivo [32]. A third technique for demonstrating pluripotency is to allow mouse ES cells in vitro to differentiate spontaneously or to direct their differentiation along specific pathways. The former is usually accomplished by removing feeder layers and adding leukemia inhibitor y factor (LIF) to the growth medium. Within a few days after changing the culture conditions, ES cells aggregate and may form embr yoid bodies (EBs). In many ways, EBs in the culture dish resemble teratomas that are obser ved in the animal. EBs consist of a disorganized array of differentiated or partially differentiated cell types that are derived from the three primar y germ layers of the embr yo--the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm [32]. The techniques for culturing mouse ES cells from the inner cell mass of the preimplantation blastocyst were first reported 20 years ago [9, 19], and versions of these standard procedures are used today in laboratories throughout the world. It is striking that, to date, only three species of mammals have yielded  ARE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS TRULY PLURIPOTENT? Pluripotency--that is the ability to give rise to differentiated cell types that are derived from all three primar y germ layers of the embr yo, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm--is what makes ES cells unique. How do we know that these cells are, indeed, pluripotent? Laborator y-based criteria for testing the pluripotent nature of ES cells derived from mice include three kinds of experiments [19]. One test is conducted by injecting ES cells derived from the inner cell mass of one blastocyst into the cavity of another blastocyst. The ""combination"" embr yos are then transferred to the uterus of a pseudopregnant female mouse, and the progeny that result are chimeras. Chimeras are a mixture of tissues and organs of cells derived from both donor ES cells and the recipient blastocyst. This test has been extended in studies designed to test whether cultured ES cells can be used to replace the inner cell mass of a mouse blastocyst and produce a normal embr yo. They can, but the process is far less efficient than that of using cells taken directly from the inner cell mass. Apparently, the ability of ES cells to generate a complete embr yo depends on the number of times they have been passaged in vitro [21, 22]. A passage is the process of removing  6   The Embr yonic Stem Cell  long-term cultures of self-renewing ES cells: mice, monkeys, and humans [27, 34, 35, 36] (see Appendix B. Mouse Embr yonic Stem Cells).  HOW DOES A MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL STAY UNDIFFERENTIATED? As stated earlier, a true stem cell is capable of maintaining itself in a self-renewing, undifferentiated state indefinitely. The undifferentiated state of the embr yonic stem cell is characterized by specific cell markers that have helped scientists better understand how embr yonic stem cells--under the right culture conditions--replicate for hundreds of population doublings and do not differentiate. To date, two major areas of investigation have provided some clues. One includes attempts to understand the effects of secreted factors such as the cytokine leukemia inhibitor y factor on mouse ES cells in vitro. The second area of study involves transcription factors such as Oct-4. Oct-4 is a protein expressed by mouse and human ES cells in vitro, and also by mouse inner cell mass cells in vivo. The cell cycle of the ES also seems to play a role in preventing differentiation. From studies of these various signaling pathways, it is clear that many factors must be balanced in a particular way for ES cells to remain in a self-renewing state. If the balance shifts, ES cells begin to differentiate [18, 31]. (For a detailed discussion of how embr yonic stem cells maintain their pluripotency, see Appendix B. Mouse Embr yonic Stem Cells.)  the ES cells are growing. For example, the plastic culture dishes used to grow both mouse and human ES cells can be treated with a variety of substances that allow the cells either to adhere to the sur face of the dish or to avoid adhering and instead float in the culture medium. In general, an adherent substrate helps prevent them from interacting and differentiating. In contrast, a nonadherent substrate allows the ES cells to aggregate and thereby interact with each other. Cell-cell interactions are critical to normal embr yonic development, so allowing some of these "" natural "" in vivo interactions to occur in the culture dish is a fundamental strategy for inducing mouse or human ES cell differentiation in vitro. In addition, adding specific growth factors to the culture medium triggers the activation (or inactivation) of specific genes in ES cells. This initiates a series of molecular events that induces the cells to differentiate along a particular pathway. Another way to direct differentiation of ES cells is to introduce foreign genes into the cells via transfection or other methods [6, 39]. The result of these strategies is to add an active gene to the ES cell genome, which then triggers the cells to differentiate along a particular pathway. The approach appears to be a precise way of regulating ES cell differentiation, but it will work only if it is possible to identify which gene must be active at which particular stage of differentiation. Then, the gene must be activated at the right time--meaning during the correct stage of differentiation--and it must be inserted into the genome at the proper location. Another approach to generate mouse ES cells uses cloning technology. In theor y, the nucleus of a differentiated mouse somatic cell might be reprogrammed by injecting it into an oocyte. The resultant pluripotent cell would be immunologically compatible because it would be genetically identical to the donor cell [25]. All of the techniques just described are still highly experimental. Nevertheless, within the past several years, it has become possible to generate specific, differentiated, functional cell types by manipulating the growth conditions of mouse ES cells in vitro. It is not possible to explain how the directed differentiation occurs, however. No one knows how or when gene expression is changed, what signal-transduction systems are triggered, or what cell-cell interactions  CAN A MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELL BE DIRECTED TO DIFFERENTIATE INTO A PARTICULAR CELL TYPE IN VITRO? One goal for embr yonic stem cell research is the development of specialized cells such as neurons, heart muscle cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels, and insulin secreting cells similar to those found in the pancreas. The directed derivation of embr yonic stem cells is then vital to the ultimate use of such cells in the development of new therapies. By far the most common approach to directing differentiation is to change the growth conditions of the ES cells in specific ways, such as by adding growth factors to the culture medium or changing the chemical composition of the sur face on which  7   The Embr yonic Stem Cell  must occur to convert undifferentiated ES cells into precursor cells and, finally, into differentiated cells that look and function like their in vivo counterparts. Embr yonic stem cells have been shown to differentiate into a variety of cell types. For example, mouse ES cells can be directed in vitro to yield vascular structures [40], neurons that release dopamine and serotonin [14], and endocrine pancreatic islet cells [16]. In all three cases, proliferating, undifferentiated mouse ES cells provide the starting material and functional, differentiated cells were the result. Also, the onset of mouse ES cell differentiation can be triggered by withdrawing the cytokine LIF, which promotes the division of undifferentiated mouse ES cells. In addition, when directed to differentiate, ES cells aggregate, a change in their three-dimensional environment that presumably allowed some of the cell-cell interactions to occur in vitro that would occur in vivo during normal embr yonic development. Collectively, these three studies provide some of the best examples of directed differentiation of ES cells. Two of them showed that a single precursor cell can give rise to multiple, differentiated cell types [16, 40], and all three studies demonstrated that the resulting differentiated cells function as their in vivo counterparts do. These two criteria--demonstrating that a single cell can give rise to multiple cells types and the functional properties of the differentiated cells--form the basis of an acid test for all claims of directed differentiation of either ES cells or adult stem cells. Unfortunately, ver y few experiments meet these criteria, which too often makes it impossible to assess whether a differentiated cell type resulted from the experimental manipulation that was reported. (For a detailed discussion of the methods used to differentiate mouse embr yonic stem cells, see Appendix B. Mouse Embr yonic Stem Cells.) Table 2.1 provides a summar y of what is known today about the types of cells that can be differentiated from mouse embr yonic stem cells.  Table 2.1.

Presentation: Self-Renewal Pathways in Human ES Cells  Whereas mouse ES cells can be readily maintained in a pristine pluripotent state by incubation with the antidifferentiation factor LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor), no such factor has yet been identified to facilitate culture of human ES cells. We have investigated whether the LIF signaling pathways are functional in human ES cells. Despite expression of the LIF receptor and the gp130 signaling subunit, and demonstration of the activation of the STAT3 signaling intermediate by treatment of human ES cells with human LIF, the cells nonetheless fail to retain pluripotency. This argues that mechanisms of self-renewal may be distinct between murine and human ES cells. We are currently characterizing protein signaling pathways that mediate self-renewal and are employing expression cloning to identify factors that facilitate human ES cell culture. This work has been aided significantly by methods for viral gene transduction of human ES cells, which will be described.    Return to top                 Meri T.

She is currently working on using human ES cells as a model of human development, differentiating human ES cells into functional tissues for transplantation and deriving new lines suitable for transplantation therapies.     Presentation: Culture and Genetic Modification of Human Embryonic Stem Cells  The focus of the Firpo lab is the regulation of stem cell growth, both from the perspective of the maintenance of stem cell potential and the regulated differentiation to functional tissues. We are interested in embryonic, fetal, and adult stem cells. Our lab has two areas of active research. First, we have developed a model of in utero hematopoietic transplantation in mice. For this model, we isolate populations of cells containing hematopoietic stem cells from adult and fetal mice and embryonic stem cells using specific antibodies. The cells are then injected into fetal mice through the uterine wall. At various times after birth, the injected mice are analyzed to determine whether engraftment has occurred, and the degree of contribution of donor cells in hematopoietic tissues, including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen.    The remaining two projects are part of our human embryonic stem (hES) program. This project covers the distribution of hES cells to other labs, both at UCSF and to academic institutions throughout the world. This project requires the expansion and characterization of the two hES lines that we have derived at UCSF and that are included in the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry. As part of the characterization of the cell lines, we will determine what is required to maintain hES cells in an undifferentiated state. We are also characterizing the differentiation capacity of these cells. Finally, we have established a training program to help establish hES culture techniques in other labs through hands-on training of individuals visiting our lab.    The second project involving hES cells explores the regulation of differentiation of hES cells into mature cells of several tissues. Currently, we are actively differentiating hematopoietic precursors and mature populations, hepatocytes, pancreatic islet cells, neural progenitors, and neural cells. We have constructed plasmid expression vectors containing reporter genes under the control of both tissue-specific and ubiquitously expressed promoters. Ultimately, development of methods of genetic alteration will allow us to regulate differentiation, isolate populations that may be suitable for transplantation therapies, and follow the engraftment of embryonic stem cell- derived tissues. In addition to monitoring the differentiation and genetic status of subclones, we assay the differentiation to the various cell lineages through an assessment of the expression of tissue-specific cell-surface markers.     In summary, this lab is studying two questions related to stem cell biology. First, what is required to keep a stem cell a stem cell, while allowing it to proliferate? Second, what signals regulate the steps that stem cells take after they become committed to differentiate?

Presentation: Elucidation of the Transcriptome of ES Cells: A Progress Report  Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from an inner cell mass of a blastocyst, 3 to 5 days postfertilization. These cells are totipotent and can proliferate without differentiation in vitro for an extended period of time. These cells can develop to derivatives from all 3 embryonic germ layers and are generating tremendous excitement. A limited number of the ES cells have been approved for further study by federally funded researchers.    Laboratories around the world are engaged in the study of regulation of specific genes transcribed in the ES cells; however, the full composition of the transcriptome is yet unknown. We have undertaken to fill in this gap by investigating the transcriptome of a number of the currently available cell lines by 5’ expressed sequence tag sequencing and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). In this presentation, I will report on the results of the first library from the WA01 cells and the corresponding trophoblasts, describe the other ongoing research, and provide Web addresses from which the data can be obtained.

Presentation: Induction and Isolation of Spinal Motor Neurons from Human ES Cells: A Prototype for the Targeted Acquisition of Desired Neuronal Phenotypes   (Additional Authors: Neeta Singh Roy and Takahiro Nakano, Cornell University Medical College)  Both the experimental and clinical use of human ES (hES)-derived neurons has been limited by the phenotypic heterogeneity of these cells and by the persistence of undifferentiated cells and undesired phenotypes in nominally enriched preparations of hES-derived neurons. To address the need for pure subpopulations of hES-derived neurons, of a defined and preselected phenotype and devoid of undifferentiated contaminants, we have established a promoter-based strategy for serially inducing and purifying specific neuronal subtypes from hES cells. As one of several initial target phenotypes, we have generated and purified spinal motor neurons, a cell type lost in the motor neuron degenerative diseases as well as in both spinal cord injury and peri-infectious motor neuronopathies. To select spinal motor neurons from hES cultures (WiCell, H1), we used retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) to first induce motor neuron phenotype, as previously described in mouse ES cells (Wichterle, Cell 110:385, 2002). We then isolated the newly generated motor neurons from these cultures, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of GFP driven by Hb9, a gene that encodes a motor neuron-selective transcription factor. Specifically, we had found that a highly conserved 3.6 kb segment of the 5’ regulatory region of the Hb9 gene was sufficient to specify gene expression to motor neurons. On that basis, we established a motor neuron-selection vector, in which this 3.6 kb Hb9 enhancer was placed 5’ to an hsp68 basal promoter driving EGFP. The resultant plasmid E/Hb9:EGFP was transfected into hES cultures, which were treated with SHH/RA. This treatment resulted in the induction of motor neurons within the hES cultures, which could be identified on the basis of E/Hb9-driven GFP expression. Flow cytometry showed that the EGFP+ cells constituted 1.1 ± 0.3% (n=3, ± SE) of the total cell population, or 4.6% after correction, for our net transfection efficiency of 24%. FACS allowed the near-purification of these E/Hb9:GFP+ cells, virtually all of which co-expressed Islet1 protein. When raised in GDNF/BDNF, with and without human muscle cell co-culture, the E/Hb9:P/hsp68:EGFP+ cells also expressed choline acetyltransferase, indicating their cholinergic transmitter phenotype; all co-expressed the generic neuronal markers bIII-tubulin and MAP-2. Importantly, no detectable expression was noted of any markers of undifferentiated ES cells, which included SSEA-4 and Tra-1-81. The sorted motor neurons achieved functional maturation within 2 to 3 weeks, as indicated by both their glutamate-induced calcium responses upon confocal calcium imaging and by their fast sodium currents and action potentials on whole-cell patch-clamp analysis. Thus, the serial induction of motor neuron phenotype by RA and SHH, followed by E/Hb9(3.6):EGFP-based FACS, permitted the high-yield generation and purification of functional motor neurons from human embryonic stem cells. This approach may be used as a prototype for the specific selection and purification of defined neuronal subpopulations from otherwise mixed cultures of human embryonic stem cells.     This work was supported by Project ALS and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NIH.   Return to top                 Thaddeus G. Golos, Ph.D.,  did his graduate training in reproductive biology in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, followed by postdoctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

He is currently an Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and an Associate Professor at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center.   Presentation: Differentiation Into Placental Trophoblast Cells  Trophoblast differentiation and placental morphogenesis are the earliest events in mammalian development and yet are virtually impossible to study in humans. Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have captured the public imagination as a source of cells for regenerative medicine and reconstitution of diseased organs. Human ES cells also provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve our understanding of the basic processes of early human development. We have evaluated the expression of trophoblast markers in differentiating ES cells. Trophoblast differentiation is initiated during embryoid body formation, as demonstrated by secretion of chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone and estrogen, and the expression of the nonpolymorphic MHC class I trophoblast marker HLA-G. We propose that hES in vitro differentiation systems, such as the formation of embryoid bodies, will allow for an investigation of factors and regulatory pathways that direct both trophoblast differentiation and placental morphogenesis.

His graduate research with Robert Baughman focused on the physiology of synaptic transmission in cultures of rat cerebral cortex. From 1986 to 1988, he was a Junior Fellow in the Harvard University Society of Fellows. He performed postdoctoral research at Harvard with Bruce Bean on whole-cell and single channel currents mediated by glutamate receptors and was appointed Instructor in Neurobiology.

He began studying the physiology of pluripotent stem cells in 1992 as part of an ongoing collaboration with David Gottlieb and John McDonald to analyze the neural differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and, more recently, human ES cells.    Presentation: Physiology of Human ES Cells  Ion channels and electrical signaling play important roles in neurons, muscle, and secretory cells. The normal operation of these cells requires the coordinated interaction of currents through a variety of different channels that have distinct gating and permeation properties. Aberrant channel expression, or production of channels with abnormal properties, can have pathological consequences. Thus, the development of successful therapies involving human ES cells will require the functional evaluation of their electrical signaling capabilities. Physiological recordings from differentiating ES cells allow for the direct evaluation of ion channel characteristics and for cellular electrical signaling. Studies of mouse ES cells differentiating along the neural lineage have revealed physiological characteristics that parallel the properties of primary neurons and glia. Mouse ES-derived neurons express voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels that underlie the action potential. They also express a variety of neurotransmitter-activated ion channels as well as voltage-gated calcium channels, which are required for calcium-dependent transmitter release. Within 2 to 3 weeks after induction, mouse ES-derived neurons form functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Recordings from undifferentiated mouse and human ES cells reveal a much simpler physiological phenotype. Undifferentiated ES cells express voltage-dependent currents and intercellular junctions that may be important for cells in the undifferentiated state, but they lack most of the voltage- and ligand-gated currents that are observed in differentiated neurons and glia.

He has been at the University of Wisconsin since 1996 after completing his Internal Medicine residency and fellowship in cardiovascular diseases at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Kamp’s research focuses on understanding the normal function of ion channel proteins in the heart and the dysfunction of these channels in disease states such as heart failure and arrhythmias. Recently, human embryonic stem cells have been utilized in this research to produce human cardiac myocytes for basic cellular electrophysiology studies.      Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells Develop into Multiple Types of Cardiac Myocytes: Action Potential Characterization  Human embryonic stem (hES) cells can differentiate in vitro, forming embryoid bodies (EBs) composed of derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. Spontaneously contracting outgrowths from these EBs contain cardiomyocytes (CMs); however, the types of human CMs and their functional properties are unknown. This study characterizes the contractions and action potentials (APs) from beating EB outgrowths cultured for 40 to 95 days. Spontaneous and electrical field-stimulated contractions were measured with video edge-detection microscopy. Beta-adrenergic stimulation with 1.0 µmol/L isoproterenol resulted in a significant increase in contraction magnitude. Intracellular electrical recordings using sharp KCl microelectrodes in beating EB outgrowths revealed three distinct classes of APs: nodal-like, embryonic atrial-like, and embryonic ventricular-like. The APs were described as embryonic based on the relatively depolarized resting membrane potential and slow AP upstroke. Repeated impalements of an individual beating outgrowth revealed a reproducible AP morphology from different cells, indicating that each outgrowth is composed of a predominant cell type. Complex functional properties typical of cardiac muscle were observed in the hES cell-derived CMs, including rate adaptation of AP duration and provoked early and delayed afterdepolarizations. Repolarization of the AP showed a significant role for- IKr based on E4031-induced prolongation of AP duration, as anticipated for human CMs. In conclusion, hES cells can differentiate into multiple types of CMs displaying functional properties characteristic of embryonic human cardiac muscle. Thus, hES cells provide a renewable source of distinct types of human cardiac myocytes for basic research, pharmacological testing, and potentially, therapeutic applications.   Return to top                  Dan S. Kaufman, M.D., Ph.D.,  received a bachelor of science degree from Stanford University. Subsequently, he completed a combined M.D./Ph.D. program at the Mayo Medical School and Mayo Graduate School in Rochester, Minnesota. His graduate work was in immunology and focused on natural killer cell interactions with MHC class I molecules. Dr. Kaufman then went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for a residency in internal medicine and fellowship in hematology. While at the University of Wisconsin, he began studies of hematopoietic development of human embryonic stem (ES) cells as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Dr. James Thomson.    In 2002 Dr. Kaufman took a faculty position at the University of Minnesota as an assistant professor in the Stem Cell Institute and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, where he continues laboratory-based research on human ES cells and does clinical work in hematology and hematopoietic cell transplantation.    Presentation: Stromal and Cytokine Requirements To Support Hematopoietic Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells  Human embryonic stem (ES) cells offer an extraordinary resource to define the proteins and genetic pathways that regulate the earliest stages of human blood development. We have compared two different methods to support derivation of hematopoietic cells from human ES cells: stromal cell co-culture and embryoid body (EB) formation. Initial studies demonstrated co-culture of human ES cells with stromal cells derived from hematopoietic microenvironments in media containing FBS, but no other exogenous cytokines promoted blood development. Under these conditions, we could readily identify CD34+ precursor cells and hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs) that produce characteristic erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic colonies when placed in a standard methylcellulose assay. Mature CD45+ cells are also demonstrated in this system. Subsequent studies have been done to better characterize the contribution of cell-bound and soluble factors to support this hematopoietic development. Coculture of ES cells and S17 cells in serum-free media leads to few CFCs. However, the addition of cytokines known to support hematopoietic expansion, stem cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and flt3-ligand (flt3L) to the serum-free media results in increased numbers of CFCs. Transwell culture experiments demonstrate that direct contact between ES cells and stromal cells is not required. This led us to examine hematopoietic differentiation by EB formation. Here, we observe derivation of CD34+, CD45+ cells, and CFCs when EBs are allowed to differentiate in media-containing serum, but not under serum-free conditions. However, unlike the stromal cell co-culture method, the addition of SCF, flt3L, and TPO to EBs grown in serum-free media did not result in significant CFC development. These results suggest that cytokines may act on stromal cells to produce additional factors that support survival and growth of hematopoietic cells.   Return to top                 Gordon Keller, Ph.D.,  is Professor of Gene Therapy and Molecular Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. His research focuses on defining and characterizing the early events involved with the establishment, growth, and maturation of the embryonic hematopoietic and vascular systems. Using the mouse ES differentiation system, he has identified a novel progenitor with the potential to generate both hematopoietic and endothelial progeny, a cell with characteristics of the hemangioblast. Through the identification of this progenitor, Dr. Keller has been able to define the role of a number of different genes in the earliest stages of hematopoietic and endothelial commitment. Dr. Keller serves on the Board of Directors for the International Society for Stem Cell Research.    Presentation: Differentiation of ES Cells to the Hematopoietic Lineage    This presentation will cover important aspects of the commitment of mouse ES cells to hematopoiesis and the process of how we plan to use this information for the differentiation of human ES cells.   Return to top                  Barbara Knowles, Ph.D.,  received her Ph.D. in zoology from Arizona State University. After a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Berkeley, she had a distinguished career at the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology in Philadelphia. Additionally, Dr. Knowles was a Professor of Microbiology and a Professor in Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. She is currently the Associate Director of The Jackson Laboratory, where she serves as the Director of Research and Training and as a Senior Staff Scientist.   Her graduate and professional training was in Drosophila genetics, and her subsequent research career is marked by groundbreaking publications in three main areas of mammalian genetics: the immune control of tumor growth, hepatocellular carcinogeneis, and the molecular control at the initiation of embryonic development. Dr. Knowles serves on many advisory and editorial boards, and she is a Presidential Professor of the University of Maine. Since 1995, she has served as the Consulting Director for the European Mouse Mutant Archive in Monterotondo, Italy, with nodes in France, Sweden, Portugal, and England.   Dr. Knowles, together with Dr. Davor Solter, developed a technique to immunosurgically isolate the embryonic stem cell-enriched inner cell mass of the mouse blastocyst and made the monoclonal antibodies that characterize the stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEAs1, 3, and 4), which variously marked stem cells and differentiated cells of mouse embryos, mouse and human embryonal carcinoma cells, and human embryonic stem cells.   Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells, a Practicum (and Stem Cells on Land and on Sea)  Keeping current with cutting-edge techniques requires flexible, expedient approaches to effective practical training. In response to the rapid rate of technological advancement in biomedical sciences, The Jackson Laboratory (TJL) has instituted a series of intensive, hands-on courses. Our premise is that a quick response to the immediate needs of the everchanging scientific and technological landscape is crucial. Efficient transfer of techniques and methodologies to researchers who will use and disperse them brings rigor to a rapidly emerging field. Moreover, gathering a small group of innovators from around the world to teach the students promotes learning and interactions among them, further advancing nascent research areas. The formula we have adopted focuses faculty attention on training a cadre of students through short morning lectures to illustrate hands-on principles and through extended long sessions in the laboratory. A separate meeting immediately following the practicum supplies perspective and further emersion in the field of study.    The 2002 Human Embryonic Stem Cell Course at TJL, and the accompanying meeting (a joint venture with the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory), Stem Cells on Land and on Sea, were conceived as a response to the change in the political climate that made Government funding of this research area a possibility. Informal interactions led to a course and a conference outline and NIH grant applications for funding. We will discuss both meetings, which were held in 2002 and are planned for July or August 2003.   Return to top                 Tenneille Ludwig, Ph.D.,  received both her B.S. and M.S. degrees in reproductive endocrinology from Washington State University’s Department of Animal Sciences. She completed a Ph.D. in embryology and developmental biology with a minor in bioethics, in 2001 under the direction of Dr. Barry Bavister at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her Ph.D. thesis focused on the effect of the culture milieu on the physiology and developmental competence of embryos in vitro. Dr. Ludwig currently leads the culture optimization program for both human and nonhuman ES cells in the laboratory of Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture: Strategies To Improve Success    Techniques used to culture human ES cells successfully differ from those used with other cell types—even other stem cell types. This workshop will highlight the areas of human ES cell culture protocols that are the most critical to success and those that have traditionally been the most troublesome. A panel discussion will follow, with the opportunity to have specific technique questions answered.   Return to top                  John W. McDonald III, M.D., Ph.D.,  is Assistant Professor of Neurology and Neurological Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine and is Director of the Spinal Cord Injury Program and the Restorative Treatment and Research Center. His career goals have been to bridge basic science, translational, and clinical research through clinical trials in the realm of the regeneration and recovery of function in spinal cord injury. Dr. McDonald’s clinical focus is spinal cord injury from all causes. The emphasis of his research is regeneration, with a focus on remyelination and optimization of spontaneous regeneration and recovery of function. One active strategy is utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells for neural transplantation. His group is developing remyelination as an approachable strategy for the restoration of function in the injured nervous system. The second strategy is maximizing spontaneous regeneration in part by optimizing patterned neural activity. Functional electrical stimulation and partial weight-supported robotic ambulation are two active approaches being studied at the level of regeneration in animals and at the level of fMRI and recovery of function at the human level. Dr. McDonald has received numerous awards for his research, including the Research for Freedom Award, Gateway to a Cure; L.W. Freeman Award for significant contributions to regenerative spinal cord research, National SCI Association; Keck Foundation Award for ES cell transplantation in the injured spinal cord; Murray Goldstein Award, Neurotrauma Society; and S. Weir Mitchell Award for research excellence from the American Academy of Neurology. Dr. McDonald’s ES cell transplantation work was cited as one of the top 10 scientific discoveries of 1999 by Science magazine.   Presentation: Human ES Cells: Immunological and Ultrastructural Features; Towards Novel Strategies of CNS Repair   (Additional authors: Aileen Lu and Jim Huettner, Restorative Treatment and Research Center, Washington University in St. Louis)  We have evaluated multiple human ES cell lines that have been previously approved for use with Federal research (WA01:NIH code, H1:Provider’s code from WiCell Research Institute and BG01, hESBGN.01 from BresaGen, Inc.). We have compared multiple strategies for neural differentiation toward oligodendrocytes. A particular early focus has been characterizing undifferentiated human ES cells and later staged cells in the process toward neural differentiation using immunological markers, ultrastructural examination, and physiological properties. (See the presentation by our collaborator, Dr. Huettner, for physiological characteristics.) We are in the process of characterizing the expression of connexin hemichannels using the above approaches. We have compared and contrasted these characteristics of human ES cells with our previous work on mouse ES cells and will present a summary of these results. Multiple novel features of human and mouse ES cells have been uncovered that offer potential toward strategies to repair the damaged nervous system. The human ES cell system will be discussed within this therapeutic target domain.   Return to top                 Ronald McKay, Ph.D.,  is the Chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the Basic Neuroscience Program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He has held this position since April 1993 when he moved from MIT. Dr. McKay has also worked at Oxford University and at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He received his doctorate for work in nucleic acid chemistry with Dr. Ed Southern at the University of Edinburgh. His recent work focuses on the stem cells of the central nervous system but also influences thinking in other areas of medicine, including diabetes and cancer.   Presentation: Functional Somatic Cells From ES Cells  Work from our group played an important role in the early period when stem cells of the central nervous system were first defined (McKay R. Science. 276:66-71, 1997). Our more recent work contributes to our fundamental understanding of three major processes in the developing nervous system: (1) cell cycle control (Tsai, R.Y. and R. McKay Genes & Dev. 16:2991-3003, 2002), (2) the control of cell fate (Panchision, D.M. et al. Genes Dev. 15: 2094-2110, 2001) and (3) the early steps in neuronal differentiation (Vicario-Abejon, C. et al. Eur.J.Neurosci. 12: 677-688, 2000). Recent advances in the application of stem cell biology to Parkinson’s disease clearly demonstrates the potential importance of stem cells in models of neuronal loss or injury (Studer, L. et al. Nat.Neurosci. 1: 290-295, 1998; Lee, S-H. et al. Nat.Biotechnol. 18: 675-679, 2000; Kim, J-H. et al. Nature 418: 50-6, 2002). We have also made contributions in other areas, for example, in glial transplantation (Brustle, O. et al. Science 285: 754-756, 1999), adult neurogenesis (Cameron, H.A. and R.D. McKay Nat.Neurosci. 2: 894-897, 1999; Cameron, H.A. and R.D. McKay J.Comp.Neurol. 435: 406-17, 2001) and endocrine pancreatic differentiation (Lumelsky, N. et al. Science 292: 1389-1394, 2001). These results suggest that this field will generate a powerful technology to analyze fate and function in many cell types.   Return to top                 Kevin E.

Pera, Ph.D.,  is Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Centre for Early Human Development at the Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development. He obtained his B.A. degree in English language and literature from the College of William and Mary in Virginia and his Ph.D. in pharmacology from George Washington University. Dr. Pera was awarded an NIH National Research Service Award, and conducted postdoctoral research at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, both in London. Thereafter, he led research teams at the Institute of Cancer Research and at Oxford University before coming to Monash University.     Dr. Pera is an expert in the cell biology of human pluripotent stem cells, having pioneered the development and characterization of human embryonal carcinoma cell lines, work which led directly to the isolation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells from blastocysts by his laboratory. The Monash group was the second in the world to isolate human ES cells and the first to demonstrate somatic differentiation of these cells in vitro. His recent invited lecture presentations include those at the International Alpha Congress on Assisted Reproduction (Copenhagen, 1999), Ontogeny Corporation (Boston, 2000), Australian Society for Biomaterials (Melbourne, 2000), Serono Symposium on Embryos Stem Cells and Transplantation (Canberra, 2000), IMSUT Symposium for Stem Cell Biology (Tokyo, 2000), Royal Society of Edinburgh Meeting on Cloning Stem Cells and Cell Therapy (Edinburgh, 2000), ICDB (Gold Coast, 2000), Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation (La Jolla, 2000), Japanese Society for Hematological Transplantation (Kyoto, 2000), Cold Spring Harbor Stem Cell and Progenitor Cell Conference (2001), Royal Society Discussion Meeting on Stem Cells (2001), Sheffield University Symposium on Stem Cells (2001), the Seoul Symposium on Stem Cells and Therapeutic Cloning (2001), and the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience (2002). Dr. Pera’s recent peer review responsibilities have included grant reviews for NHMRC, ARC, UK BBSRC, Wellcome Trust, and Yorkshire Cancer Research Campaign; manuscript referee for PNAS, International Journal of Cancer, Experimental Cell Research, Science, International Journal of Radiation Biology, Reproduction Fertility and Development (Editorial Board), Nature, Stem Cells, Molecular Reproduction and Development, Developmental Biology, and Journal of Cell Science. He has advised the Australian federal government and the Victorian State government, the U.S. NIH, and the UK Department of Health on scientific matters relating to the ethics of the use of ES cells in research and medicine. Dr. Pera is co-inventor on four provisional patents relating to human ES cells and is a founding scientist of ESI, an Australian-Singapore biotechnology company founded to develop and exploit human ES cell technology.     The research in Dr. Pera’s laboratory focuses on the control of growth and the differentiation of human ES cells. His team members are trying to identify the signals that determine whether a stem cell will multiply to produce more stem cells, or instead turn into a precursor of a specialized body cell, such as nerve or muscle. Dr. Pera’s laboratory has a special interest in the differentiation of stem cells into endodermal progenitors, cells in the embryo committed to forming the liver, gut, lung, and pancreas. By understanding the early events in this pathway, the team can direct stem cells to form pancreatic cells more efficiently. These pancreatic cells will in turn have many uses in research into diabetes and may eventually be used in transplantation therapy to treat these diseases.    Presentation: Human Embryonic Stem Cells: Technical Aspects of Growth Characterization and Manipulation  Our laboratory studies the basic biology of human embryonic stem cells and the early phases of their differentiation. I will discuss systems used currently in our laboratory for the derivation and culture of embryonic stem cells, approaches to the characterization of stem cells, and some methodologies used in studying embryonic stem cell differentiation.

Since 1998, Dr. Rao has been an Associate Professor at the National Center for the Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. He currently is an Adjunct Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and his research interests include stem cells and the developing nervous system.    Presentation: Stem Cell Biology  The Stem Cell Biology section of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the NIA focuses on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of stem and progenitor cells during development and in the adult. This research is based firmly on the concept that the same signaling mechanisms that regulate the development and plasticity of the nervous system are altered during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, an understanding of developmental mechanisms is likely to lead to novel approaches to preventing and treating neurological disorders of aging. Ongoing research is divided into four interrelated areas: (1) signal transduction mechanisms regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of embryonic stem cells and pluripotent neural stem cells; (2) cellular and molecular alterations that occur in neural stem cells during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases; (3) elucidation of the mechanisms whereby environmental factors, such as diet and intellectual and physical activity, can alter stem cell biology; and (4) development of novel stem cell therapy-based approaches for repairing the aging and diseased nervous system.

Presentation: NIH Technology Transfer: Facilitating Access to hESCs  After President Bush announcement his human embryonic stem cell (hESC) policy on August 9, 2001, it became clear that one of the many hurdles to the distribution of these cells would be the negotiation of agreements governing their transfer. NIH decided that its Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) would negotiate agreements with the hESC providers to provide cells to Public Health Service intramural researchers, including researchers working at the NIH, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The agreements would also require that the hESC providers offer no more restrictive terms to NIH-funded nonprofit institutions. Extramural institutions could then choose to accept the same reasonable terms or attempt to negotiate alternative agreements for themselves to suit their particular needs, policies, or local laws.    The OTT began negotiations first with WARF/WiCell, which owns the dominant patents that likely govern most, if not all, the approved hESC lines. WARF/WiCell entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2001. By spring 2002, NIH had entered into similar agreements with BresaGen, ES Cell International, and the University of California, San Francisco. In addition, NIH has required recipients of infrastructure grants for the scale up and distribution of hESCs to provide an acceptable plan for the distribution of cells to researchers. This talk will survey the intellectual property and policy issues that surround these agreements and the sharing of research materials that will ultimately be derived from hESC lines. Such policies seek to balance the needs of the research community to conduct research in an unencumbered manner with the intellectual property incentives companies need to invest in the development of new therapeutics that ultimately better public health.

Presentation: In Vivo Engraftment and Multilineage Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC)-Derived Hematopoietic Cells in Primary Fetal Sheep Recipients   (Additional authors: A.D. Narayan, J.A. Thomson, R.L. Lewis, D.S. Kaufman, and G.Almeida-Porada, Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV; Wisconsin Regional Primate Center; and Departments of Anatomy and Internal Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI)  We used transplantation into primary pre-immune fetal sheep recipients (55 to 62 days-old, term: 145 days) to evaluate the in vivo potential of hematopoietic elements derived from hESCs. The in utero human/sheep xenograft model has proven valuable in assessing the in vivo hematopoietic activity of stem cells from a variety of fetal and postnatal human sources. Three transplant groups with cells from differentiated hESCs (H1 and H1.1) were established. Human ESC was differentiated on the mouse S17 cell line for 17 days. The 17-day cultures were found to be positive for CD34, CD133, CD38, gly-A, CD33, CD15, CD10, CD56, and nestin and were negative for CD45, CD3, CD2, HLA-DR, CD19, CD8, CD4, CD14, and CD20. Each fetus (n=7) in group 1 was transplanted with 0.75-2.8 x 105 CD34+/CD38- cells isolated from the day 17 cultures by sorting. The fetuses in group 2 (n=13) were given 0.13 – 0.95 x 105 CD34+/Lin- cells/fetus obtained from the day 17 cultures by sorting, while the fetuses in group 3 (n=12) were transplanted with 1 – 1.5 x 105 whole-day 17 culture cells/fetus. The animals in groups 1 and 2 were allowed to complete gestation and be born. As can typically happen, 3 recipients (2 in group 1, 1 in group 2) were lost to study (fetus absorbed). Four animals in group 1 and 5 animals in group 2 were found to be chimeric with a variety of donor (human) cell types that in some cases have persisted for 13 months post-transplant. For example, the relative percentages of human cells expressing CD34, CD45, CD3, CD13, CD133, CD38, HLA-DR, and CD2 at 5 months post-transplant in a representative animal in group 1 were 0.05, 0.26, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15, 0.09, 4.4, and 0.04, while at 3 months post-transplant the values for cells expressing CD45, CD3, CD133, CD38, HLA-DR, and Gly-A for a representative animal in group 2 were: 0.5, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.5 respectively. The donor (human) cells appear to be responsive to human cytokines. The administration of human G-CSF to animals chimeric with CD34+/CD38- cells on two separate occasions, at 4 and 12 months post-transplant, resulted in increased donor cell activity. Increases in human cell activity were also noted in chimeric group 1 and group 2 animals treated with human GM-CSF. Two of the recipients in group 3 were sacrificed at 2 months post-transplant (i.e., 1 month before birth). Both were negative for human hematopoietic cell activity. The remaining group 3 animals will be evaluated at birth and at intervals thereafter. Careful examination of these two animals and of 4 additional animals from groups 1 and 2 sacrificed at intervals after birth failed to reveal any gross anatomical abnormalities; all live animals appear to be healthy. These findings indicate that hematopoietic cells derived from hESC can engraft and undergo multilineage differentiation in the human/sheep model. Serial transplantations into secondary and/or tertiary fetal sheep recipients will establish whether the hematopoietic activity in these primary hosts can be attributed to long-term engrafting cells.    Return to top                 Su-Chun Zhang, M.D., Ph.D.,  received his M.D. (1984) and M.Sc. degrees (1989) in China and his Ph.D. training (1996) in Canada in neural and cell biology, with a focus on the biology and pathology of oligodendroglia and microglia. In his subsequent career, he studied the differentiation of oligodendroglia from neural stem cells and the transplantation of neural stem/progenitors in animal models of myelin disorders. Dr. Zhang is currently an Assistant Professor of Anatomy and Neurology at the Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research, funded by NIH and private research foundations, explores the potential of embryonic stem cells as a model for early human neural development, such as neural induction and neural patterning, and as a source for generating therapeutically active cells for neurodegenerative diseases.      Presentation: Neural Specification of Human Embryonic Stem Cells  Human embryonic stem (hES) cells not only provide a continuous cell source for potential cell therapy but also offer an otherwise inaccessible system to unveil events of early embryonic development in humans. We have established a stepwise, chemically defined culture system that directs the hES cells to neuroepithelia, the earliest neural cells. The process of neuroepithelial specification resembles in vivo neural induction in terms of timing, formation of neural tube-like structures, and response to FGF signaling. Using this in vitro model system, we are dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying neural specification from hES cells. The in vitro-generated neuroepithelial cells can differentiate into neurons and glial cells in culture and after transplantation into rodent brain. To determine whether the hES cell-derived neuroepithelial cells can be preferentially fated to a particular neural lineage, we employ the principle of neural patterning and are establishing culture systems that persuade the neuroepithelial cells to choose a particular neuronal or glial fate, such as midbrain dopamine neurons, spinal cord motoneurons, or myelinating oligodendrocytes. The function of the in vitro-generated mature neural cells will be assessed using electrophysiological techniques to measure action potentials and synaptic communication in neurons in culture and after transplantation into rodent brain and spinal cord. We hope that an understanding of neural induction and patterning in humans will lead to an optimized procedure for generating enriched or purified neuroepithelia and specialized neural cells, which will lay groundwork for potential future use of human ES cells in the treatment of neurological injuries and diseases.

There has been an explosion of interest in using ES cells, or their committed progenitor offspring, to repair or replace damaged tissues, yet the immune response to such cells across histocompatibility barriers has been poorly defined.  This project examines the immune response to ES cells and their committed progenitor offspring, and to genetically engineer ES cells to inhibit graft rejection. Early studies have revealed that uncommitted ES cells express no classical MHC class I molecules and small but varying amounts of the non-classical class I MHC CD1d.  Such cells elicit weak CTL responses across syngeneic or allogeneic barriers and form tumors across syngeneic barriers. We have found that ES cells are killed by NK and LAK cells with lysis highly dependent on LFA-1/ICAM interactions. We found a similar response to neural progenitor cells (NP)which are similar to their ES founders in failing to express MHC molecules and expressing high levels of ICAM. In contrast, embryonal carcinoma cells (EC), which arise in syngeneic animals injected with ES cell populations are not killed by NK or LAK cells. The failure to kill EC cells appears to relate in some EC cells to lack of expression of ICAM and in others, an increased expression of both classical and non-classical class I MHC molecules. The mechanism by which EC cells develop from ES cells is also being explored.          Because of the tumorigenic potential of ES cells, prevention of rejection cannot be aimed at ES cells, but will instead be aimed at non-tumorigenic committed progentior or mature differentiated cells.  To protect such committed or differentiated cells from rejection, our strategy is to clone protective molecules, such as Fas-ligand, into ES cells and place them under control of a lineage specific promoter, so that they will not be expressed until the cell assumes a differentiated (non-malignant) phenotype.  Additionally, we may clone into an ES cell line a suicide gene expressing an enzyme under control of an ES cell specific promoter.

Because of this flexibility, stem cells hold promise for solving mysteries about the fundamental biology of all cells.    ""America's scientists need powerful tools to find better ways to diagnose and treat health problems,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. ""Understanding the biology of stem cells can help fill in the blanks about what causes cells to misbehave in disease.""    To elucidate the basic biology of stem cells, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) is funding three Exploratory Centers for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research. NIGMS is awarding $2.2 million for the first year of funding for the three 3-year awards, which over their lifetime are expected to total more than $6.3 million. The source of the human embryonic stem cells is limited to federally approved stem cell lines listed on the National Institutes of Health Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry.    By awarding the center grants, NIGMS hopes to establish human embryonic stem cells as a unique model system to help researchers understand the extraordinary complexities of human biology.    ""What gives stem cells their unique property to self-renew? When, how and why does a stem cell decide to differentiate, becoming another kind of cell? There is so much basic research we must conduct before we can unlock the potential of these cells and fulfill their promise,"" said NIH director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D. ""NIGMS is leading the way toward answering these tremendously important questions, many of which may be common to all kinds of cells.""    A key goal is to train basic scientists to learn how to work with the finicky cells. Many researchers have had a difficult time getting stem cells to thrive in an undifferentiated state in the laboratory. The shortage of scientists with expertise in stem cell research and the lack of molecular tools to study stem cells are currently rate-limiting steps in advancing the progress of embryonic stem cell research.    ""NIGMS recognizes a critical need to increase the scientific workforce in this important area of 21st century biomedical research,"" said Judith H. Greenberg, Ph.D., acting director of NIGMS. ""We also want to help the research community overcome some of the technological barriers that have prevented biologists from developing stem cells into a powerful model system for probing health and disease.""    Each NIGMS center is a collaborative effort involving several researchers who will work together on specific pilot projects. The three new center awards were made to:       University of Washington, Seattle/Fred Hutchinson Cancer  Research Center (C. Anthony Blau, M.D., principal  investigator) —$753,000 for the first year of funding to  improve methods to culture, maintain, manipulate,  differentiate and compare the 12 federally approved human  embryonic stem cell lines. The group will also seek to  identify the molecular signals that enable stem cells to  self-renew, evaluate methods for genetically modifying stem  cells and study how stem cells choose to become specialized  cell types such as neurons and heart cells.      University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor (K.  Sue O'Shea, Ph.D., principal investigator) —$778,00 for  the first year of funding to apply knowledge and expertise  in cell biology, developmental genetics and tissue biology  to the study of human embryonic stem cells. The group will  establish a core laboratory for maintaining and  distributing human embryonic stem cells to the University  of Michigan scientific community, develop research tools to  study stem cells and support education and training on the  use of the cells.      WiCell Research Institute in Madison, Wisconsin (James  Thomson, D.V.M., Ph.D., principal investigator) —$669,000  for the first year of funding to create a central core  facility to provide cell tissue culture support, including  media preparation, quality control and routine chromosomal  analysis of cultured stem cells. The group will also  examine in detail how stem cells make the transition from  primitive cells to becoming neurons. The researchers will  study how certain signals cause stem cells to lose their  ability to self-renew, as well as how molecules produced by  ""feeder cells"" support the self-renewal process.      The three new awards are the first exploratory centers involved in research on human embryonic stem cells to be funded by NIH. In addition, NIH has awarded grants for stem cell-related investigator-initiated research, training and career development as well as for stem cell preparation, testing and distribution. NIGMS has also recently awarded 14 administrative supplements to scientists at various academic institutions across the United States to rapidly incorporate research on human embryonic stem cells into their ongoing federally supported research goals.

In contrast, SCNT with the goal of generating an embryonic stem                cell line (“therapeutic cloning”) remains a controversial issue.                Although therapeutic cloning holds the promise of yielding new ways                of treating a number of degenerative diseases, it is not acceptable                to many because the derivation of an embryonic stem cell line from                the cloned embryo (an essential step in this process) necessarily                involves the loss of an embryo and hence the destruction of potential                human life.                                In this article, I will develop two main arguments that are based                on the available scientific evidence. 1) In contrast to an embryo                derived by  in vitro  fertilization (IVF), a cloned embryo                has little if any potential to ever develop into a normal human                being. This is because, by circumventing the normal processes of                gametogenesis and fertilization, nuclear cloning prevents the proper                reprogramming of the clone's genome,  which is a prerequisite                for development of an embryo to a normal individual. It is unlikely                that these biological barriers to normal development can be solved                in the foreseeable future. Therefore, from a biologist's point                of view, the cloned human embryo, used for the derivation of an                embryonic stem cell and the subsequent therapy of a needy patient,                has  little if any potential  to create a normal human life.                    2) Embryonic stem cells developed from a cloned embryo                are functionally indistinguishable from those that have been generated                from embryos derived by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Both types                of embryonic stem cells have an  identical potential  to serve                as a source for therapeutically useful cells.                It is crucial that the ongoing debate on the possible therapeutic                application of SNCT is based on biological facts. The goal of this                article is to provide such a basis and to contribute to a more rational                discussion that is founded on scientific evidence rather than on                misconceptions or misrepresentations of the available scientific                data.                                  I. Introduction                                It is important to distinguish between “reproductive cloning”                and “nuclear transplantation therapy” (also referred to as “SCNT”                or “therapeutic cloning”). In reproductive cloning a cloned embryo                is generated by transfer of a somatic nucleus into an enucleated                egg with the goal to create a cloned individual. In contrast, the                purpose of nuclear transplantation therapy is to generate an embryonic                stem cell line (referred to as “ntES cells”) that is “tailored”                to the needs of a patient who served as the nuclear donor. The ntES                cells could be used as a source of functional cells that would be                suitable for treating an underlying disease by transplantation.                                             There is now experience from cloning of seven different mammalian                species that is relevant for three main questions of public interest:                1) Would a cloned human embryo be “normal”? 2) Could the problems                currently seen with cloning be solved in the foreseeable future?                3) Would ES cells derived from a cloned human embryo be “normal”                and useful for cell therapy? The arguments advanced in this article                are strictly based on molecular and biological evidence that has                been obtained largely in the mouse. I will not attempt to review                the cloning literature but only refer to selected papers on cloned                mice. The relevant literature on cloning of mammals can be found                in recent reviews (Byrne and Gurdon, 2002; Gurdon, 1999; Hochedlinger                and Jaenisch, 2002b; Oback and Wells, 2002; Rideout et al., 2001;                Wilmut, 2001; Young et al., 1998).                                                                 II. Most cloned animals die or are born with abnormalities                                               The majority of cloned mammals derived by nuclear transfer (NT)                die during gestation, and those that survive to birth frequently                display “Large Offspring Syndrome”, a neonatal phenotype characterized                by respiratory and metabolic abnormalities and enlarged and dysfunctional                placentas (Rideout et al., 2001; Young et al., 1998).  In order                for a donor nucleus to support development into a clone, it must                be reprogrammed to a state compatible with embryonic development.                 The transferred nucleus must properly activate genes important for                early embryonic development and also suppress differentiation-associated                genes that had been transcribed in the original donor cell.  Inadequate                “reprogramming” of the donor nucleus is most likely the principal                reason for developmental failure of clones (for definition of “reprogramming”,                see footnote 1). Since few clones survive to birth, the question                remains whether survivors are fully  normal or merely the                least affected animals carrying through to adulthood despite harboring                subtle  abnormalities that originate in faulty reprogramming                but that are not severe enough to interfere with survival to birth                or beyond.                                               III. Reprogramming of the genome during normal development                and after nuclear transfer                              The fundamental difference between nuclear cloning and normal fertilization                is that the nucleus used in nuclear cloning comes from a somatic                (body) cell that has not undergone the developmental events required                to produce the egg and sperm .   Nuclear cloning involves the                transplantation of a somatic nucleus into the oocyte from which                the nucleus has been removed.  However, the genes in the somatic                nucleus are not in the same state as those in the fertilized egg                because nuclear transplantation short-cuts the complex process of                egg and sperm maturation which involves extensive “reprogramming”                of the genome, a process that shuts some genes off and leaves others                on. Reprogramming during gametogenesis prepares the genome of the                two mature gametes with the ability to activate faithfully the genetic                program that ensures  normal embryonic development when they                combine at fertilization (Fig 1a).  This reprogramming of                the genome begins at gastrulation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs)                are formed, and continues during differentiation into                mature gametes resulting, in a radically different                chromatin configuration of sperm and oocyte (Rideout et al., 2001).                                            Experiments have shown that uniparental embryos (embryos whose                genomes are derived solely from either the maternal or paternal                parent) do not develop normally. Uniparental embryos first seem                normal; they direct cleavage (early development to the blastocyst                stage) despite profound differences in their epigenetic organization                (Reik et al., 2001). However, uniparental embryos fail soon after                the implantation of the embryo into the wall of the uterus, indicating                that both parental genomes are needed and functionally complement                each other beginning at this later step of embryogenesis. Presumably,                the different epigenetic organization of the two genomes is crucial                for achieving normal development. Moreover,  it has been well                established that the imbalance of imprinted gene expression represents                an important cause of embryonic failure (for definition of “imprinting”,                see footnote 2).                                 In order for cloned embryos to complete development, genes normally                expressed during embryogenesis but silent in the somatic donor                cell, must be reactivated. This complex process of epigenetic                remodeling (i.e., the reconfiguration of the genome by turning on                and turning off specific genes) that occurs during gametogenesis                in normal development ensures that the genome of the zygote can                faithfully activate early embryonic gene expression (Fig 1a; definition                of  “epigenetics”, see footnote 3). In a cloned embryo, reprogramming,                which in normal gametogenesis requires months to years to complete,                must occur in a cellular context radically different from gametogenesis                and within the short interval (probably within hours) between transfer                of the donor nucleus into the egg and the time when zygotic transcription                becomes necessary for further development. Given these radically                different conditions, one can envisage a spectrum of different outcomes                to the reprogramming process ranging from (i) no reprogramming of                the genome, resulting in immediate death of the NT embryo; through                (ii) partial reprogramming, allowing initial survival of the clones,                but resulting in an abnormal phenotype and/or lethality at various                stages of development; to (iii) faithful reprogramming producing                fully normal animals (Fig 1b). The phenotypes observed over the                past five years in cloned embryos and newborns suggest that complete                reprogramming is the exception ,  if it occurs at all.                                                 IV. Development of clones depends on the differentiation-state                of the donor nucleus                                The majority of cloned embryos fail at an early step of embryonic                development, soon after implantation in the wall of the uterus,                an early step of embryonic development  (Hochedlinger and                Jaenisch, 2002b; Rideout et al., 2001). Those that live to birth                often display common abnormalities irrespective of the donor cell                type (Table 1). In addition to symptoms referred to as “Large Offspring                Syndrome” ,  neonate clones often suffer from respiratory distress                and kidney, liver, heart or brain defects (Cibelli et al., 2002).                However, the abnormalities characteristic of cloned animals are                not inherited by their offspring (Tamashiro et al., 2002), indicating                that epigenetic aberrations (i.e., failure of genome reprogramming)                rather than genetic aberrations (changes in the sequences within                the DNA) are the cause.                                The efficiency of creating cloned animals is strongly influenced                by the differentiation-state of the donor nucleus (Table 1). In                the mouse, for example, only 1-3% of cloned blastocysts derived                from somatic donor nuclei, e.g., those prepared from  fibroblasts                or cumulus cells, will develop to adult cloned animals                (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002b).     In certain cases, such                as those using terminally differentiated B or T cell donor nuclei,                 the efficiency of cloning is so low as to preclude the direct                derivation of cloned animals. In stark contrast to these examples,                cloning using donor nuclei prepared from embryonic stem (ES) cells                is significantly more efficient (between 15 and 30 %, Table 1).                This correlation with differentiation-state suggests that embryonic                nuclei require less reprogramming of their genome, ostensibly because                the genes essential for embryonic development are already active                and need not be reprogrammed. In fact, the nucleus of an embryonic                cell such as an ES cell may well have the same high efficiency to                generate postnatal mice after nuclear transfer as the nucleus prepared                from a recently fertilized egg  (Table 1, compare Fig. 4). Nonetheless,                most if not all mice that have been cloned from ES cell donor nuclei,                in contrast to mice derived through natural fertilization from the                zygote, areabnormal, indicating that the processes of gametogenesis                (development of sperm and of egg) and fertilization endows the zygote                nucleus with the ability to direct  normal  development. In                summary, these data indicate that the potential of a nucleus to                generate a normal embryo is lost progressively with development.                                                                  V.  Adult cloned animals: how normal are they?                                              The observation that apparently healthy adult cloned animals have                been produced in seven mammalian species (albeit at low efficiency)                is being used by some as a justification for attempting to clone                humans.  In fact, even those that survive to adulthood, such                as Dolly, may succumb relatively early in adulthood                because of numerous health problems. Insights into the mechanisms                responsible for clone failure before and after birth have come from                molecular and biological analyses of mouse clones that have reached                (i) the blastocyst stage, (ii) the perinatal period and (iii) adulthood.                                              (i) Most clones fall short of activating key embryonic                genes and fail early                                 As stated above in order for clones to develop, the genes that                are normally expressed during embryogenesis, but are silent in the                somatic donor cell, must be reactivated (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch,                2002b; Rideout et al., 2001). It is the failure to                activate key “embryonic” genes that are required for early development                that leads to the demise of most clones just after implantation.                Recently, a set of about 70 key embryonic genes termed “Oct-4 like”                genes have been identified that are active in early embryos but                not in somatic donor cells. Importantly, the failure to faithfully                activate this set of genes can be correlated with the frequent death                of cloned animals during the immediate post-implantation period                (Bortvin et al., 2003). These results define “faulty reprogramming”                as the cause of early demise of cloned embryos as the failure to                reactivate key embryonic genes that are silent in the donor cell.                                              (ii) Newborn clones misexpress hundreds of genes                                               Clones that survive to birth suffer from serious problems, many                of which appear to be due to an abnormal placenta. The most common                phenotypes observed in animals cloned from either somatic or ES                cell nuclei are fetal growth abnormalities such as increased placental                and birth weight. This has suggested that surviving clones had accurately                reprogrammed the “Oct-4 like” genes that are essential for the earliest                stages of development, i.e. those immediately following implantation                of the embryo into the uterus. The abnormal phenotype of those clones                that do survive through these early stages and develop to birth                indicates that other genes that are important for later stages of                development but are  not essential for early survival are                not correctly reprogrammed.  To assess the extent of abnormal expression                of various genes in the cells of clones, global gene expression                has been assessed by microarray analysis of RNA prepared from the                placentas and livers of neonatal cloned mice, i.e., clones that                survived development and were viable at birth; these clones had                been derived by nuclear transfer (NT) of nuclei prepared either                from cultured ES cells or from freshly isolated cumulus cells (somatic                cells that surround the egg)  (Humpherys et al., 2002).  Direct                comparison of gene expression profiles of over 10,000 genes (of                the 30,000 or so in the mammalian genome) showed that for both classes                of cloned neonatal mice, approximately 4% of the expressed genes                in their placentas differed dramatically in expression levels from                those in controls, and that the majority of abnormally expressed                genes were common to both types of clones.  When imprinted genes,                a class of genes that express only one allele (either from maternal                or paternal origin), were analyzed, between 30 and 50% were not                correctly activated. These data represent strong molecular evidence                that cloned animals, even those that survive to birth, suffer from                serious gene expression abnormalities.                                 (iii) Cloned animals develop serious problems                with age                               The generation of adult and seemingly healthy adult cloned animals                has been taken as evidence that normal cloned animals can be generated                by nuclear transfer, albeit with low efficiency. Indeed, a routine                physical and clinical laboratory examination of 24 cloned cows of                1 to 4 years of age failed to reveal major abnormalities (Lanza                et al., 2001). Cloned mice of a corresponding age as that of the                cloned cows (2 - 6 months in mice vs. 1 - 4 years in cows) also                appear “normal” by superficial inspection. However, when cloned                mice were aged, serious problems, not apparent at younger ages,                became manifest. One study found that the great majority of cloned                mice died significantly earlier than normal mice, succumbing with                immune deficiency and serious pathological alterations in multiple                organs (Ogonuki et al., 2002). Another study found that aged cloned                mice became overweight with major metabolic disturbances (Tamashiro                et al., 2002). Thus, serious abnormalities in cloned animals may                often become manifest only when the animals age.                                Firm evidence about aging and “normalcy” of cloned farm animals                is incomplete or anecdotal because cloned animals of these species                are still comparatively young (relative to their respective normal                life span). For example, the premature death of Dolly (Giles and                Knight, 2003) is entirely consistent with serious abnormalities                in cloned sheep that become manifest only at later ages. Also, two                of the analyzed cloned cows developed disease soon after the study                on “healthy and normal cattle” (Lanza et al., 2001) had appeared:                one animal developed an ovarian tumor and another one suffered brain                seizures (J. Cibelli, pers. comm.). While it cannot be ruled out                that these are “spontaneous” maladies unconnected with the cloning                procedure, a more likely alternative is that these problems were                direct consequences of  the nuclear transfer procedure.                                 (iv) Are there any “normal” clones?                                              It is a key question in the public debate whether it is ever possible                to produce a normal individual by nuclear cloning, even if only                with low efficiency. The available evidence suggests that it may                be difficult if not impossible to produce normal clones for the                following reasons: 1) As summarized above, all analyzed clones at                birth showed dysregulation of hundreds of genes. The development                of clones to birth and beyond despite widespread epigenetic abnormalities                suggests that mammalian development can tolerate dysregulation of                many genes. 2) Some clones survive to adulthood by compensating                for gene dysregulation. Though this “compensation” assures  survival ,                it may not prevent maladies to become manifest at later ages. Therefore,                most if not all clones are expected to have at least subtle abnormalities                that may not be so severe as to result in an obvious phenotype at                birth but will cause serious problems later as seen in aged mice. Clones                may just differ in the extent of abnormal gene expression: if the                key “Oct-4 like” genes are not activated, clones die immediately                after implantation. If those genes are activated, the clone may                survive to birth and beyond.                                As schematically shown in Fig. 2, the two stages when the majority                of clones fail are immediately after implantation and at birth.                These are two critical stages of development that may be particularly                vulnerable to faulty gene expression. Once cloned newborns have                progressed through the critical perinatal period,  various compensatory                mechanisms may counterbalance abnormal expression of other genes                that are not essential for the subsequent postnatal survival. However,                the stochastic occurrence of disease and other defects at later                age in many or most adult clones implies that such compensatory                mechanisms do not guarantee “normalcy” of cloned animals. Rather,                the phenotypes of surviving cloned animals may be distributed over                a wide spectrum from abnormalities causing sudden demise at later                postnatal age or more subtle abnormalities allowing survival to                advanced age (Fig. 2). These considerations illustrate the complexity                of defining subtle gene expression defects and emphasize the need                for more sophisticated test criteria such as environmental stress                or behavior tests. However, the available evidence suggests that                truly normal clones may be the exception.                                It should be emphasized that “abnormality” or “normalcy” is defined                here by molecular and biological criteria that distinguish cloned                embryos or animals from control animals produced by sexual reproduction.                The most informative data for the arguments presented above come                from the mouse. There is, however, every reason to believe that                these difficulties associated with producing mice and a variety                of other mammalian embryos by nuclear transplantation will also                afflict the process of human reproductive cloning (Jaenisch and                Wilmut, 2001).                                 (v) Is it possible to overcome the problems                inherent in reproductive cloning?                                 It is often argued that the “technical” problems in producing                normal cloned mammals will be solved by scientific progress that                will be made in the foreseeable future. The following considerations                argue that this may not be so.                                A principal biological barrier that prevents clones from being                normal is the “epigenetic” difference (such as distinct patterns                of DNA methylation, for definition of “methylation”, see footnote                4) between the chromosomes inherited from mother and from father,                i.e. the difference between the “maternal” and the “paternal” genome                of an individual. Such methylation of specific DNA sequences is                known to be responsible for shutting down the expression of nearby                genes.  Parent-specific methylation marks are responsible for the                expression of imprinted genes and cause only one copy of an imprinted                gene, derived either from sperm or egg, to be active while the other                allele is inactive (Ferguson-Smith and Surani, 2001). When sperm                and oocyte genomes are combined at fertilization, the parent-specific                marks established during oogenesis and spermatogenesis persist in                the genome of the zygote (Fig 3A). Of interest for this discussion                is that within hours after fertilization ,  most of the global                methylation marks (with the exception of those on imprinted genes)                are stripped from the sperm genome whereas the genome of the oocyte                is resistant to this active demethylation process (Mayer et al.,                2000). This is because the oocyte genome is in a different “oocyte-appropriate”                epigenetic state than the sperm genome. The oocyte genome becomes                only partially demethylated within the next few days by a passive                demethylation process. The result of these post-fertilization changes                is that the two parental genomes are epigenetically different (as                defined by the patterns of DNA methylation) in the later stage embryo                and remain so in the adult in imprinted as well as non-imprinted                sequences.                                In cloning, the epigenetic differences that are established during                gametogenesis may be erased because both parental genomes of the                somatic donor cell are introduced into the egg from the outside                and are thus exposed equally to the demethylation activity present                in the egg cytoplasm (Fig 3B). This predicts that imprinted genes                should be particularly vulnerable to inappropriate methylation and                associated dysregulation in cloned animals. The results summarized                earlier are consistent with this prediction. For cloning to be made                safe, the two parental genomes of a somatic donor cell would need                to be physically separated and separately treated in an “oocyte-appropriate”                and a “sperm-appropriate” way, respectively. At present, it seems                that this is the only rational approach to guarantee the creation                of the epigenetic differences that are normally established during                gametogenesis. Such an approach is beyond our present abilities.                These considerations imply that  serious biological barriers                 exist that interfere with faithful reprogramming after nuclear transfer.                It is a safe conclusion that these biological barriers represent                a major stumbling block to efforts aimed at making nuclear cloning                a safe reproductive procedure for the foreseeable future.                                It has been argued that the problems in mammalian cloning are                similar to those encountered with IVF 30 years ago: Thus, following                this argument, the methods of culture and embryo manipulations just                would need to be improved to develop reproductive cloning into a                safe reproductive technology that is as acceptable as IVF. This                argument appears to be fundamentally flawed. It is certainlycorrect                that merely “technical” problems needed to be solved to make IVF                efficient and safe.  It is important to distinguish between the                perfection of  technical skills to imitate a biological event and                the development of wholly new science to overcome the blocks to                events that have severe biological restrictions. Nuclear cloning                faces serious biological barriers that cannot be addressed by mere                adjustments in experimental technique. Indeed, since the birth of                Dolly  no  progress has been made in solving any of the underlying                 biological issues  of faulty gene reprogramming and resulting                defective development.                                    VI. Therapeutic applications of SCNT                                 (i) Reproductive cloning vs. therapeutic cloning                                              In spite of the biological and ethical barriers associated with                reproductive cloning, nuclear transfer technology has significant                therapeutic potential that is within our grasp. There is an enormous                distinction between the goals and the end product of these two technologies.                The purpose of reproductive cloning is to generate a cloned embryo                that is then implanted in the uterus of a female to give rise to                a cloned individual. In contrast, the purpose of nuclear transplantation                therapy is to generate an embryonic stem cell line that is derived                from a patient (referred to as “ntES cells”) and can be used subsequently                for tissue replacement.                                Many scientists recognize the potential of NtES cells for organ                transplantation (for recent review see (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch,                2003). This procedure is currently complicated by immune rejection                due to immunological incompatibility. Thus, virtually all organ                transplants undertaken at present involve the use of donor organs                that are recognized as foreign by the immune systems of the recipient                and thus are targeted for destruction by these immune systems.                    To treat this “host versus graft” disease, immunosuppressive drugs                are routinely given to transplant recipients in order to suppress                this organ rejection. Such immunosuppressive treatment has serious                side effects including increased risks of infections and malignancies.                 In principle, ES cells can be created from a patient's nuclei                using nuclear transfer.  Because ntES cells will be  genetically                identical to the patient’s cells, the risks of immune rejection                and the requirement for immunosuppression are eliminated. Moreover,                ES cells provide a renewable source of replacement tissue allowing                for repeated therapy whenever needed. Finally, if ES cells are derived                from a patient carrying a known genetic defect, the mutation in                question can be corrected in the ntES cells using standard gene                targeting methods before introducing these ES cells (or derived                tissue-specific stem cells) back into the patient's body.                                 (ii) Combining nuclear cloning with gene and cell                therapy                                 In a “proof of principle” experiment, nuclear cloning in combination                with gene and cell therapy has been used to treat a mouse genetic                disorder that has a human counterpart (Figure 4). To do so, the                well-characterized  Rag2  mutant mouse was used as “patient”                (Rideout et al., 2002). This mutation causes  severe combined                immune deficiency (SCID) ,  because the enzyme that catalyzes                immune receptor rearrangements in lymphocytes is non-functional.                Consequently, these mice are devoid of mature B and T cells, a disease                resembling human  Omenn syndrome  (Rideout et al., 2002).                                In a first step, somatic (fibroblast) donor cells were isolated                from the tails of  Rag2 -deficient mice and their nuclei were                injected into enucleated eggs. The resultant embryos were cultured                to the blastocyst stage and isogenic ES cells were isolated. Subsequently,                one of the mutant  Rag2  alleles was targeted by homologous                recombination in ES cells to restore normal  Rag2  gene structure                and function. In order to obtain somatic cells for treatment, these                genetically repaired ES cells were differentiated into embryoid                bodies and further into hematopoietic precursors by expressing  HoxB4 ,                a transcription factor that is responsible for programming the behavior                of the hematopoietic stem cells, i.e., those cells that are able                to generate the full range of red and white cells in the blood.                Resulting hematopoietic precursors were transplanted into irradiated                 Rag2 -deficient animals in order to treat the disease caused                by their  Rag2  mutation. Initial attempts to engraft these                cells were, however, unsuccessful because of an increased level                of natural killer (NK) cells in the  Rag  mutant host.  ES                cell derived hematopoietic cells express low levels of the MHC antigens                and thus are a preferred target for NK mediated destruction. Elimination                of NK cells by antibody depletion or genetic ablation allowed the                ntES cells to efficiently populate the myeloid and to a lesser degree                the lymphoid lineages of these mice. Functional B and T cells that                had undergone proper rearrangements of their immunoglobulin and                T cell receptor alleles as well as serum immunoglobulins were detected                in the transplanted mutants.  Hence, important cellular components                of the immune system were restored in mice that previously were                unable to produce these cells.                                This experiment demonstrated that embryonic stem (ES) cells derived                by NT from somatic cells of a genetically afflicted individual can                be combined with gene therapy to treat the underlying genetic disorder.                Because Rag2 deficiency causes an increase in NK activity and necessitated                the elimination of NK cells prior to transplantation in the above-described                experiments, some have concluded that “The experiment failed to                show success with therapeutic cloning” (Coalition and Ethics, 2003)                and that “This indicates that the only successful therapy using                cloned embryos would be through 'reproductive' cloning,                to produce born clones who can serve as tissue donors for patients”                (Prentice, 2002). This is a troubling misinterpretation of the data.                (i) It has been shown that ES cell-derived hematopoietic cells can                successfully engraft and rescue lethally irradiated mice indicating                that increased NK activity is a peculiarity of Rag2-deficiency (Kyba                et al., 2002).  Therefore, it would seem that for most diseases,                no anti-NK treatment would be required to assure engraftment of                ES cell-derived somatic cells. (ii) It is correct that treatment                of a human patient with  Omenn syndrome,  which is equivalent                to Rag2 deficiency, by SCNT may also require anti-NK treatment to                 transiently  reduce NK activity. This would allow the transplanted                cells to engraft as in the mouse experiment.  Once these cells are                successfully engrafted, there is every reason to believe that such                anti-NK treatment would no longer be necessary.                                       In conclusion, the mouse experiment indicates that, unlike the                situation with reproductive cloning, no  biological  barriers                exist that in principle prevent the use of SCNT to treat human diseases.                The  technical  issues in using SCNT and human stem cells for                therapeutic purposes need, however, to be solved ,  but there                are no indications at present that these represent formidable problems                that will resist relatively rapid solution.                                               VII. Faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer: does                it interfere with the therapeutic potential of ES cells derived                by SCNT?                                As summarized above, most if not all cloned animals are abnormal                because of faulty reprogramming after nuclear transfer. Does this                epigenetic dysregulation affect the potential of ntES cells to generate                functional somatic cells that can be used for cell therapy? To address                this question, I will first compare the  in vivo  development                of embryos with the  in vitro  process of ES cell derivation                from explanted embryos. This will be followed by discussing the                epigenetic state of the ES cell genome. Finally, I will contrast                the phenotype of cloned mice derived from ES cell donor nuclei with                that of chimeric mice generated by injection of ES cells into blastocysts.                                                (i) The phenotype of an  embryo is determined by                 its donor nucleus                                 As mentioned repeatedly above, embryos can be derived from the                fertilized egg or from a somatic nucleus by SCNT. The potential                of the resulting blastocyst, when implanted into the womb, to develop                into a fetus and a postnatal animal depends strictly on the nature                of the  donor nucleus (Fig 5): (i) When derived from the zygote,                most embryos develop to birth and generate a normal animal; (ii)                Similarly, most blastocysts cloned from an embryonic stem cell donor                nucleus develop to birth but, in contrast to the normally fertilized                embryo, the great majority of the cloned animals will be abnormal                (“Large offspring syndrome”) (Eggan et al., 2001; Humpherys et al.,                2001); (iii) The great majority of cloned blastocysts derived from                somatic donor nuclei such as fibroblasts or cumulus cells will die                soon after implantation and only a few clones will survive to birth                and these too  will be abnormal, suffering once again from                the Large offspring syndrome (Wakayama and Yanagimachi, 2001); (iv)                Finally, the likelihood of cloned blastocysts derived from another                type of somatic donor nuclei - those present in terminally differentiated                lymphoid cells  -  to generate a cloned animal is extremely                low and has not been achieved except by using a two step procedure                involving the intermediate generation of embryonic stem cells (Hochedlinger                and Jaenisch, 2002a). These observations suggest that a blastocyst                retains an “epigenetic memory” of its donor nucleus. This memory                determines its potential for fetal development: while a fertilized                embryo develops normally, any embryo derived by SCNT will be abnormal                though the efficiency of a given clone to develop to birth is strongly                influenced by the differentiation state of the donor cell (see Table                1). In other words, the cloned embryo after implantation into the                womb will be abnormal because the cloned blastocyst retained an                epigenetic memory of its donor nucleus and this causes faulty fetal                development. This epigenetic memory is erased when a blastocyst,                either derived by nuclear cloning or from the fertilized egg, is                explanted into tissue culture and grown into an embryonic stem cell.                Erasure of the epigenetic memory has major consequences for the                “normalcy” of embryonic stem cells.                                 (ii) The derivation of embryonic stem cells is a highly                selective process that erases the “epigenetic memory” of the donor                nucleus                                 Embryonic stem cells, regardless of whether they have been generated                from a fertilized egg or by SCNT, are derived from the cells of                a blastocyst that have been explanted and propagated in tissue culture.                Of the blastocyst cells that are explanted in this way, those that                derive from the portion of the blastocyst termed the inner cell                mass (ICM) initially express “key” embryonic genes such as Oct-4.                However, soon after explantation, most ICM cells extinguish Oct-4                expression and cease proliferating (Buehr et al., 2003). Only one                or a few of the ICM-derived cells will eventually re-express Oct-4                and these few Oct-4-positive cells are those that resume rapid proliferation ,                 yielding the cell populations  that we designate as “embryonic                stem” cells. These cells represent a cell population that has no                equivalent in the normal embryo and may be considered a tissue culture                artifact, though a useful one (Fig. 6).                                The important point for this discussion is that the propagation                of blastocyst cells  in vitro  results in a rare population                of surviving cells that have erased the “epigenetic memory” of the                donor nucleus. This process results ultimately in ES cells that                have, regardless of donor nuclear origin, an identical developmental                potential. In other words, ES cells derived from embryos produced                by normal fertilization and those produced from cloned embryos are                functionally indistinguishable (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002b;                Rideout et al., 2002; Wakayama et al., 2001). Because the ES cells                that derive from normally fertilized embryos are able to participate                in the generation of all normal embryonic tissues, we can conclude                that the ES cells derived from cloned embryos have a similar potential                to generate the full range of normal tissues.                                     (iii) ES cells, epigenetic instability and therapeutic                potential                                 Epigenetic instability appears to be a consistent characteristic                of ES cells. This was shown when individual ES cells were analyzed                for expression of imprinted genes: even cells in a recently subcloned                ES cell line differed strongly in the expression of genes such as                H19 or Igf2. The variable expression was correlated withthe DNA                methylation status of the genes, which switched from an unmethylated                to a methylated state between sister cells (Humpherys et al., 2001).                This was a surprising result in view of the known potential of ES                cells to generate terminally differentiated cells that function                normally after transplantation into an animal. Possible explanations                include (i) that epigenetic instability in ES cells is a consequence                of propagation of cells in tissue culture or (ii) that epigenetic                instability is a prerequisite for cells to be pluripotent, i.e.,                this instability may be a manifestation of a plasticity in the gene                expression program that is required to enable the ES cells to generate                a wide variety of differentiated cell lineages.                                Whatever the explanation for the observed epigenetic instability                of ES cells may be, it supports the view that the process of generating                ES cells erases all epigenetic memory of the donor nucleus and,                as a consequence of the selection process, generates epigenetic                instability in the selected cells. In other words, epigenetic instability                appears to be an intrinsic characteristic of ES cells regardless                of whether derived by SCNT or from a fertilized egg. This                is consistent with the conclusion that both types of ES cells have                an equivalent potency to generate functional cells in culture and,                in the longer term, fully normal differentiated tissues upon implantation                of these cells  in vivo .                                  (iv) ES cells form normal chimeras but abnormal                nuclear clones                                 As outlined above, faulty reprogramming leads to abnormal phenotypes                of cloned mice derived from ES cell donor nuclei. Why is faulty                reprogramming and epigenetic instability a problem for reproductive                cloning but not for therapeutic applications? The main reason for                this seeming paradox is that, in contrast to reproductive cloning,                the therapeutic application of NT does not require the formation                of a fetus. Therapeutic applications involve the ability of cloned                ES cells to form a single tissue or organ, not to recapitulate all                of fetal development. For example, normal fetal development requires                faithful expression of the imprinted genes. As outlined above, nuclear                cloning causes between 30% and 50% of imprinted genes to be dysregulated                consistent with the notion that disturbed imprinting is a major                contributing factor to clone failure. As most imprinted genes have                no known function in the postnatal animal, the dysregulation of                imprinting would not be expected to impede functionality of  in                vitro  differentiated ES cells because this process does not                require the formation of a fetus. Therefore, the functionality of                mature cells derived in culture from ES cells would not depend on                the faithful reprogramming of the imprinted genes. Dysregulation                of some imprinted genes such as  Igf2  are known, however,                to cause disease in the adult. Thus, it will be important to test                whether dysregulation of such genes has adverse effects on the function                of somatic cells derived from ES cells.                                  When injected into a blastocyst, ES cells form normal                chimeras. It appears that the presence of surrounding “normal” cells,                i.e. cells that are derived from a fertilized embryo, prevents  an                abnormal phenotype of the chimera such as the “Large Offspring Syndrome”                that is typical for cloned animals. Any therapeutic application                creates, of course, a chimeric tissue where cells derived from ntES                cells are introduced into a diseased adult individual and interact                with surrounding “normal” host cells. Therefore, no phenotypic abnormalities,                such as those seen in cloned animals, would be expected in patients                transplanted with cells derived from ntES cells.                                 VIII. SCNT for cell therapy: destruction of potential                human life?                                A key concern raised against the application of the nuclear transplantation                technology for tissue therapy in humans is the argument that the                procedure involves the destruction of potential human life. From                a biological point of view, life begins with fertilization when                the two gametes are combined to generate a new embryo that has a                unique combination of genes and has a high potential to develop                into a normal baby when implanted into the womb. A critical question                for the public debate on SCNT is this one: is the cloned embryo                equivalent to the fertilized embryo?                                In cloning, the genetic contribution is derived from one individual                and not from two. Obviously, the cloned embryo is the product of                laboratory-assisted technology, not the product of a natural event.                From a biological point of view, nuclear cloning does not constitute                the creation of new life, rather the propagation of existing life                because no meiosis, genetic exchange and conception are involved.                Perhaps more important is, however, the overwhelming evidence obtained                from the cloning of seven different mammalian species. As summarized                above, the small fraction of cloned animals that survive beyond                birth, even if they appear “normal” upon superficial inspection,                 are likely not so. The important conclusion is that a cloned human                embryo would have little if any potential to develop into a normal                human being. With other words, the cloned human embryo lacks essential                attributes that characterize the beginning of  normal  human                life.                                Taking into account the potency of fertilized and cloned embryos,                the following scenarios regarding their possible fates can be envisaged                (Fig. 7). Fertilized embryos that are “left over” from IVF have                three potential fates: disposal, generation of normal embryonic                stem cells or generation of a normal baby when implanted into the                womb. Similarly, the cloned embryo has three potential fates: it                can be destroyed or could be used to generate a normal ntES cell                line that has the same potential for therapy as an ES cell derived                from a fertilized embryo. In contrast to the fertilized embryo,                the cloned embryo has little if any potential to ever generate a                normal baby. An embryonic stem cell line derived by                nuclear may, however, help sustain existing life when used as a                source for cell therapy that is “tailored” to the need of the patient                who served as its nuclear donor.                                 If SCNT were accepted as a valid therapeutic option,                a major concern of its implementation as medical procedure would                be the problem of how to obtain sufficient numbers of human eggs                that could be used as recipients. Commercial interests may pressure                women into an unwanted role as egg donors. The recent demonstration                that embryonic stem cells can be coaxed into a differentiation pathway                that yields oocyte-like cells (Hubner et al., 2003) may offer a                solution to this dilemma. If indeed functional oocytes could be                generated from a generic human ES cell line, sufficient eggs could                be generated in culture and serve as recipients for nuclear transfer                without the need of a human egg donor. It seems that technical issues,                not fundamental biological barriers, need to be overcome so that                transplantation therapy can be carried out without the use of human                oocytes.                                                              Fig 1:   Reprogramming in normal development and nuclear                cloning.                     a . The genome of primordial                germ cells (PGCs) is hypomethylated (“reset”, white boxes). Reprogramming                and establishment of parent specific epigenetic marks occurs over                the course of gametogenesis so that the genome of sperm and egg                are competent to express the genes that need to be activated in                early embryonic (box with wavy lines) and later (hatched box) development.                During cleavage and early postimplantation development “embryonic”                genes, such as Oct 3/4, become activated (black box) and are repressed                at later stages (stippled boxes) when tissue specific genes (hatched                boxes) are activated in adult tissues (A, B, C). Epigenetic reprogramming                of imprinted and non-imprinted genes occurs during gametogenesis                in contrast to X inactivation and the readjustment of telomere length                which take place postzygotically.                                                                                           b . Reprogramming of a somatic nucleus following nuclear                transfer may result in (i) no activation of “embryonic” genes and                early lethality, (ii) faulty activation of embryonic genes and an                abnormal phenotype, or (iii) in faithful activation of “embryonic”                and “adult” genes and normal development of the clone. The latter                outcome is the exception if it occurs at all.                                               Fig. 2: The phenotypes are distributed over a wide range of                abnormalities.  Most clones fail at two defined developmental                stages, implantation and birth. More subtle gene expression abnormalities                result in disease and death at later ages.                                               Fig 3:  Parental epigenetic differences in normal                and cloned animals                                 A:  The  genomes of oocyte and sperm are differentially                methylated during gametogenesis and are different in the zygote                when combined at fertilization. Immediately after fertilization                the paternal genome (derived from the sperm) is actively demethylated                whereas the maternal genome is only partially demethylated during                the next few days of cleavage.  This is because the oocyte genome                is in a different chromatin configuration and is resistant to the                active demethylation process imposed on the sperm genome by the                egg cytoplasm. Thus, the methylation of two parental genomes is                different at the end of cleavage and in the adult. Methylated sequences                are depicted as filled lollipops and unmethylated sequences as empty                lollipops.                                               B:  In cloning a somatic nucleus is transferred into the                enucleated egg and  both  parental genomes are exposed to the                active demethylating activity of the egg cytoplasm. Therefore, the                parent specific epigenetic differences are equalized.                                               Fig. 4:   Scheme for therapeutic cloning combined with                gene and cell therapy.                                 A piece of tail from a mouse homozygous for the recombination                activating gene 2 (Rag2) mutation was removed and cultured. After                fibroblast-like cells grew out, they were used as donors for nuclear                transfer by direct injection into enucleated MII oocytes using a                Piezoelectric driven micromanipulator. Embryonic stem (ES) cells                isolated from the NT-derived blastocysts were genetically repaired                by homologous recombination. After repair, the ntES cells were differentiated                 in vitro  into embryoid bodies (EBs), infected with the HoxB4iGFP                retrovirus, expanded, and injected into the tail vein of irradiated,                Rag2-deficient mice (after (Rideout et al., 2002)).                                                             Fig. 5: Blastocysts retain epigenetic memory of donor                nucleus                                  Blastocysts can be derived from the fertilized egg or by nuclear                transfer. After implantation development of the embryo strictly                depends on the donor nucleus:  Blastocysts derived from a fertilized                egg  will develop with high efficiency to  normal  animals;                blastocysts derived by NT from an ES cell donor will develop with                high efficiency to  abnormal  animals; blastocysts derived                by NT from a fibroblast or cumulus cell donor will develop with                low efficiency to  abnormal  animals; blastocysts derived by                NT from B or T donor cells will not develop to newborns by direct                transfer into the womb (only by a 2 step procedure, compare (Hochedlinger                and Jaenisch, 2002a).                                               Fig. 6: The establishment of ES cells from blastocysts                erases epigenetic memory of donor nucleus                                Most cells of the inner cell mass turn off Oct-4 like genes and                die after explantation of blastocysts into tissue culture. Only                one or a few cells turn on the Oct-4 like genes and proliferate.                The surviving cells will give rise to ES cells. During this highly                selective outgrowth of the surviving cells all epigenetic memory                of the donor nucleus is erased. Therefore, regardless of donor nucleus                (fertilized egg or somatic nucleus in cloned embryos), all ES cells                have an equivalent potency to generate functional differentiated                cells.                                               Fig. 7: Normal and cloned embryos have three possible                fates                                Embryos derived by IVF (“left over embryos”) have three fates:                they can be disposed, create  normal  babies if implanted or                can generate ES cells if explanted into tissue culture. Cloned embryos                have also three fates: they can be disposed, can generate  abnormal babies                if any when implanted or can generate ES cells when explanted. The                ES cells derived from an IVF embryo or a cloned embryo are indistinguishable                (same potency, see figure 6)                                                                                              Table 1                                                                                    Donor nucleus                       Mice                       (% of blastocysts)                       Phenotype                       Ref.

In cloning, the somatic nucleus                must activate those genes that are needed for embryonic development                but which are silent in the donor cell in order for the cloned embryo                to survive. The egg cytoplasm contains “reprogramming factors” that                can convert the epigenetic state (see footnote 3) characteristic                of the somatic donor nucleus to one that is appropriate for an embryonic                cell. This process is very inefficient leading to inappropriate                expression of many genes and causes most clones to fail early.                                2)  Imprinted genes:  For most genes, both copies, the one                inherited from father and the one inherited from mother, are expressed.                In contrast, only one of the two copies of an imprinted gene, either                the maternal one or the paternal one, is active. The two copies                are distinguished by methylation marks (see footnote 4) that are                imposed on imprinted genes either during oogenesis (maternally imprinted                genes) or during spermatogenesis (paternally imprinted genes). Thus,                the two copies of imprinted genes are epigenetically different in                the zygote and remain so in all somatic cells. These epigenetic                marks distinguish the two copies and cause only one copy to be expressed                whereas the other copy remains silent. It is estimated that between                100 and 200 genes (of the total of 30,000 genes) are imprinted.                Disturbances of normal imprinted gene expression lead to growth                abnormalities during fetal life and can be the cause of major diseases                such as Beckwith-Wiedeman or Prader-Willi syndrome.                                3)  Epigenetic changes : Cells of a multicellular organism                are genetically identical but express, depending on the particular                cell type, different sets of genes  (“tissue specific genes”). These                differences in gene expression arise during development and must                be retained through subsequent cell divisions. Stable alterations                of this kind are said to be “epigenetic”, as they are heritable                in the short term (during cell divisions) but do not involve mutations                of the DNA itself.                                4)  DNA methylation:  Reversible modification of DNA (methylation                of the base cytosine) that affects the “readability” of genes: usually,                methylated genes are silent and unmethylated genes are expressed.                DNA methylation represents an important determinant of the “epigenetic                state” of genes and affects the state of the chromatin: methylated                regions of the genome are in a “silent” state and unmethylated regions                are in an “open” configuration that causes genes to be active.                                                           _______________                              ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                                             I thank my colleagues Bob Weinberg, Gerry Fink, George Daley and                Andy Chess for critical and constructive comments on this manuscript.                                             _______________                              References                                                             Bortvin, A., Eggan, K., Skaletsky, H., Akutsu, H., Berry, D.

Michael Armstrong Professor                  Institute for Cell Engineering                  Johns Hopkins Medicine                  Baltimore, MD 21287                                            July 2003                                                  There have been but two original research articles published                  on human embryonic germ cell in the period covered by this report.                  It is appropriate that only peer-reviewed articles be considered                  in this report, as the field of stem cell research is rife with                  undocumented or unsubstantiated claims. There have been several                  publications on EG cells derived in mice and chick and comment                  will be made on these reports as they may impact on the eventual                  use or study of the human cells.                 There is a concern, given the imprinting-based developmental                  abnormalities observed in humans, and those that have been produced                  experimentally in animals, that dysregulated gene expression in                  stem cell derived tissues could pose a serious problem in the                  use of such tissues for cell-based therapies. Genomic imprinting                  is defined as an epigenetic modification of the DNA (other than                  sequence) in the germ line that leads to the preferential expression                  of a specific allele (monoallelic expression) of some genes in                  the somatic cells of the offspring in a parental dependent manner.                  Because a maternal gene allele may be a paternal allele in the                  next generation, the imprinting must be reprogrammed in the germ                  line, that is, the epigenetic ‘marks’ must be erased                  (during germ cell development) and established in the newly formed                  embryo. The timing of the erasure in humans is not known. Imprinting                  involves methylation at specific sites in the DNA and most likely,                  other changes as well.                 There have been several reports from experiments with the mouse                  that indicate that imprinting is abnormal in pluripotent stem                  cells derived from mouse embryos. These studies include abnormal                  or variable imprints in mouse EG cells, abnormal imprints in ES                  cells derived from interspecific crosses, and abnormal gene expression                  in mice derived from ES cell nuclear transfer.                 The results of the study by Onyango  et al.  utilizing EG cell                  lines derived at John Hopkins, clearly demonstrate that general                  dysregulation of imprinted genes will not be a barrier to their                  use in transplantation therapies. The report has determined that                  the EG cells are not imprinted, that is, imprinting has been erased                  in the primordial germ cells that gave rise to the EG cells, that                  the erasure is maintained in the EG cells, but in all informative                  cases, they observed the transcription of only a single allele                  in differentiated cells derived from the human EG cells. These                  results, although on a limited number of lines and only a few                  imprinted genes, would indicate that these human EG cell lines                  will serve as reliable and safe sources for the study of EG cell                  differentiation and, perhaps, cells for cell-based interventions.                 Another area of interest in genetic regulation within EG cells                  is that of X inactivation, the mammalian method for equalization                  of the dosage of X-linked genes in males and females. This equalization                  is accomplished by the down regulation of the transcriptional                  output of the X chromosomes in females, so that only one X is                  active in diploid somatic cells of both sexes. Inactivation is                  initiated in female blastocysts. Both X chromosomes in female                  primordial germ cells are active. Migeon  et al.  (2001) have demonstrated                  that in the very early stages of differentiation of cells from                  human EGs, only one X chromosome is active, indicating normal                  genetic regulation has occurred. In a report by Nesterova  et al.                   (2002) on the use of mouse female EG cells in the study of X chromosome                  inactivation/reactivation during primordial germ cell migration                  and EG cell formation. Both X chromosomes appear to be active                  in XX EG cells, and presumably, one becomes inactive when cells                  differentiate from the EG cells.                  One of the goals of stem cell research is to provide sources                  of cells for cell-based therapies. As a step in this direction,                  proof of concept or proof of principle studies involve the use                  of human cells in animal models of human disease or injury. Although                  few, if any, animal models are true models for the human diseases,                  they are the closest approximation that can be made. The first                  report on the use of cells derived from stem cells of human embryonic                  sources was recently published: Kerr  et al.  Human Embryonic Germ                  Cell Derivatives Facilitate Motor Recovery of Rats with Diffuse                  Motor Neuron Injury, J. Neuroscience 23, June 15, 2003. This is                  the first demonstration that a human pluripotent stem cell derived                  form embryonic or fetal tissue can ameliorate a disease process                  in an animal model.                 Neural progenitor cells, derived from human EG cells, were introduced                  into the cerebrospinal spinal fluid of rats that had been paralyzed                  as a result of infection with a neuroadapted Sindbis virus that                  specifically targets motor neurons in the spinal cord. All animals                  in which human cells were found had some degree of hindlimb recovery.                  It was clear from the histology of the animals that the human                  cells had differentiated into appropriate neural cell types within                  the ventral horns, including motor neurons, the results indicated                  that the major effect of the human cells was to protect host neurons                  from death and to facilitate reafferentiation of motor neuron                  cell bodies. Growth factors responsible for this recovery, produced                  by the human cells, were identified as brain-derived neurotrophic                  factor and transforming growth factor –  a.                  The significance of this experiment appears to be that for this                  disease model, the human cells supply factors that facilitate                  motor neuron recovery following viral damage. However, the cells                  did migrate to the site of injury in the spinal cord, which differentiates                  them from other cellular grafts, and then delivered the factors.                  Also, there was considerable differentiation of the human cells                  into various neural cells types in the cord.                  In a review article on deriving glucose-responsive insulin-producing                  cells from stem cells (Kaczorowski  et al.  2002), mention is made                  on the isolation of such cells from mouse and human ES cells and                  human EG cells, but no new data was presented, only a reference                  to a paper published in 2001.                                   EG cell studies in other species                 Several studies on EG cells from other species have been published.                  EG cells from the chick have been demonstrated to yield germ line                  chimeras when transferred to early embryos (Park  et al.  2003).                  EG cell lines of the mouse were found to colonize not only the                  epiblast but also the primary endoderm of the gastrulating embryo                  following aggregation with 8-cell embryos (Durcova-Hills  et al.                   2003). This observation was permitted as a result of using a transgenic                  construct effect as a lineage marker for cells of the early embryo.                  Horii  et al.  (2002) report the serum-free culture of mouse EG                  cells, a system which inhibits the ‘spontaneous’ differentiation                  due to the presence of various growth factors in the serum. The                  cells are, however, are cultured on a feeder layer.                 An area of great interest in EG cell derivation is the basis                  of the underlying mechanism for the conversion, derivation or                  transformation (terms reflecting our ignorance of the process)                  of primordial germ cells to EG cells. Kimura  et al.  (2003) report                  that the loss of a tumor suppressor gene in mice, PTEN (phosphatase                  and tensin homology deleted form chromosome ten, aka MMAC1 and                  TEP1), leads to a high incidence of testicular teratomas and enhances                  the production of EG cells from PGCs of the mutant mice. While                  it is highly unlikely that the loss of this gene in the culture                  of normal PGCs leads to the derivation of EG cells, it may implicate                  downstream signaling pathways that are involved in cell cycle                  progression, cell survival and cell migration as important players                  in the process.

Zerhouni, M.D.                  Director,                  National Institutes of Health                 Part II:  Mark B. McClellan, M.D.                  Commissioner                  Food & Drug Administration                                                CHAIRMAN KASS:   I think we should get started, notwithstanding                the fact that a few of our members are delinquent.  We'll just                keep them after school.                 This session is entitled ""Stem Cells — Moving Research from                the Bench Toward the Bedside:  The Role of the NIH,"" and then                in the second of this session, the FDA.                 This afternoon we move from the principles of the stem cell policy                to its implementation with a review of the contributions of NIH                and the FDA to efforts aimed at bringing research from the bench                toward the bedside.                  Administering government funding of stem cell research is largely                the task of the National Institutes of Health where, as we heard                from Dr. Baldwin over a year ago, vigorous efforts have been made                from the very beginning to make cell lines available to characterize                their properties to support research, training, and infrastructure.                              Today we are very pleased, and greatly honored, to have with us                the Director of the NIH, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, who has kindly agreed                to give us a progress report on the developing field of stem cell                research as it looks from the strategic center of federal support                and direction.                 Dr. Zerhouni will make a presentation after which we will have                discussion.  He has to leave sharply at 3:00.                 Dr. Zerhouni, we are in your debt for taking the time to give                us the benefit of your observations and insights.  Thank you very                much.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Thank you, Dr. Kass, and members of the                Council.  It's a pleasure for me to be here and to share with                you what NIH is doing in promoting the field of embryonic stem cell                research in particular, and stem cell research in general.                 What I'd like to do is really give you an overview of what                has happened since the implementation of President Bush's policy                on August 9, 2001, at NIH, how NIH is tackling the field of stem                cell research, what we are seeing as the major priorities and challenges                that we need to overcome as we speak.                 I will not spend too much time on the promise of stem cell research.                 I think this Council knows all of the implications of cultured pluripotent                stem cells and the challenges that are needed — that need to be                met to transform these cells in differentiated elements that can                serve in overcoming loss of function and help regenerating lost                function.                 You know also the hierarchy of stem cells that go from totipotent                to pluripotent to multipotent stem cells.  To this point, we've                never demonstrated a return from a pluripotent to a totipotent stem                cell, but there is one paper that indicates that that may be happening                in mouse stem cells.  And we will talk about that a little bit;                we'll touch upon it.                 But clearly, there are two known ways currently to make pluripotent                stem cells.  One is obviously using the inner cell mass, and one                is using germ cells.  This method was promoted by Dr. Gearhart at                Johns Hopkins and Dr. Jamie Thomson at Wisconsin.                 So when you then ask yourself, what is so unique about human embryonic                stem cells, clearly two properties come to mind — the fact that                they have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal and culture, and                that potentially they can differentiate into any adult cell type                under the right conditions.                 From the standpoint of NIH, as in any field of research that begins                to be funded at the federal level, there is an approach that needs                to be followed in the sense that research is done by people with                resources, with strategies.                  And in the area of stem cell research, as soon as I became director,                I convened groups of scientists at NIH, and we tried to define what                the milestones should be and what the pathways should be for this                area of research to grow as rapidly as possible to fulfill its promise.                              And when we look at that, there are several phases that need to                be understood, and this is the underlying strategy that supports                our activities at this point.  One, clearly, is you need to build                scientific capacity.  Remember that prior to the President's                decision there was no federal funding for this kind of research,                and, therefore, the scientific capacity in the country was likely                to be underdeveloped.  So the number one priority was to create                career development pathways, training courses, and, more importantly,                establish the infrastructure needed to do the research.                 Then, when you look at the field itself, there is a need to prove                the long-term stability of the cells, characterize them very fully                at the molecular level, and understand both theirgenetic stability                and their stability in the host, understanding the differentiation,                the growth factors, the gene regulation — all of the events that                control that specialization.                 End cell cycle control — obviously, these cells are pluripotent,                and one of the safety fears that everyone has is that they would                divide uncontrollably in the host.  So we need to understand that                mechanism.  And, obviously, since we're talking about regaining                lost function in a host, we need to understand cell host interactions.                              To do so, one of the first actions that I took as NIH Director                was to create a stem cell task force at NIH.  Prior to my arrival,                I think NIH had put together the beginnings of an implementation                policy.                  But I thought that given the challenge and given the wide-ranging                spectrum of activities that the agency needed to get into, I thought                it was very important to elevate this activity at the level of the                director and to have a specific task force, including both intramural                and extramural researchers, to look at what were the most important                roadblocks to overcome, the most important avenues of research to                stimulate quickly, and where was the — where were the pressure points,                if you will, where we needed to intervene to accelerate the field.                              Well, obviously, the task force divided itself into working groups,                as you can see.  And, no surprise, career pathways, resources, the                peer review, since obviously NIH is based on peer review and we                needed to have a cadre of competent reviewers.  And in a new field                it's always a challenge.  Tools and technologies, and obviously                the ability for us to reach out to the research community throughout                the country.                 This stem cell task force has members who are both active in the                field or have knowledge in the field of developmental biology and                cell cultures and other fields and are advising the director through                the task force, which is chaired by Dr. Jim Battey.                 As we looked at the challenges, it was quite obvious that the                immediate challenge for NIH and the human ES cell research community                was first to generate and characterize the distribution quality                human ES cell lines from the NIH.                  It's very important to understand what ""distribution                quality"" means.  It is not — a cell line being available is                not enough.  A cell line having been derived is not enough.  It                needs to be characterized, it needs to be quality controlled, it                needs to be expended, and it needs to be immediately available to                the research laboratories that need it.                 The second was the need to stimulate more research on basic biology,                and the third was the training of investigators.                 In the basic tools of the field, first and foremost, before the                use of stem cells and the approach of hypothesis-driven research,                we needed to have a cadre of confident and competent investigators                in the field.  So those were the action lines that started pretty                much last year, a little bit over a year ago.                 Now, when you look at the issue of lines, I know that the public                always tries to understand why is it that the President's policy                talks of 78 lines, and we talk about 12 lines that are available.                 And there is always a little bit of confusion, so let me, if you                don't mind, give you the steps that are needed to go from a                derivation to a fully available line.  And I think that semantics                sometimes get in the way.                 But fundamentally, as you know, derivations occur when you are                collecting the inner cell line — cell mass, and you're developing                your primary colonies.  And then, through subcultures, about 1,000                cells per well, you then expend these cell lines with about a 10                percent survival rate.                 So as we know today, these cell cultures are not as efficient                or effective as we would like them to be.  Then, you have to basically                then multiply these lines through multiple passages.                 Well, obviously, because these cells have the potential differentiation,                you need — at each passage you need to characterize through molecular                marker studies and assure yourself that these have remained stem                cell lines.  So one flask grows up to 100,000 cells, and one bank                that would be capable of fulfilling distribution needs requires                at least two billion cells.  That takes about nine months to a year.                              So, and when you distribute these cells, depending on the distributor,                there are about two million cells needed per vial, and that means                ready for distribution.                  So when people look at this, they forget that on August 9, 2001,                there were 64, 78 lines, whatever the number of qualified lines                was at the exact time.  We end up qualifying 78 sources, but to                make those sources expended and characterized to the point where                you need — you have lines available — takes about 12 months.                              So when you look at the schedule, what we have accomplished is                about — last year there was one line that was widely available,                and today there are 12.  And that's the reason between the 78                versus 12 numbers that you hear around.                  There are other lines that are being expended as we speak.  There                are agreements that are being signed.  One has to remember that                these lines do not belong to the Federal Government; they belong                to their own derivers, and, therefore, are subject to intellectual                property agreements, which sometimes are easy to negotiate and sometimes                are not so easy to negotiate.                 But I think our role was to increase as quickly as possible the                number of widely available lines that the researchers could have                access to to do the research.  So the way we did this was by rapidly                awarding to organizations with entries on the NIH-eligible cell                line registry, funds to develop those lines into distribution quality                cell lines, and that's the difference between eligible and distribution                quality.                 We gave them a two-year period of support.  We granted eight awards                for a total of over $6 million, and we have about 12 lines now ready                for shipment, meaning in my criterion for that, which I insisted                be the criterion which is listed on the website, is you can pick                up the phone and get the line delivered to you within a measurable                matter of days.                 So the program announcement will be reissued, because we have                now other sources of lines that are interested as they have learned                more about the expendability of the lines, interested in making                their lines commercially available.                 In addition to that, I think there are many sources of lines that                have reserved derivations for further expansion as we learn more                in the research.  So those are the infrastructure awards that accomplish                that.                 Then, NIH has two means, really, of supporting research.  One                is obviously training; the second is to fund investigator-initiated                research, which can be either spontaneously generated or can be                stimulated by NIH.                  And the way NIH stimulates research is by issuing program announcements                or requests for applications around areas of research that are either                aligned with the mission of the Institute that issues these RFAs                and PAs, or are general announcements that the entire NIH wants                to support.                 So one of the program announcements we made was to have grantees                develop short-term courses in human embryonic stem cell culture                techniques.  We use the T15 mechanism, and it's supported by                11 NIH institutes.                  And basically, we have been able to award four of these.  These                are courses that can take up to two or three weeks at certain centers,                and investigators can send their own core investigators or personnel                to these centers.  And these have been extremely well received by                the research community.                 We have also career development awards, career enhancement awards                for stem cell research specifically issued by several institutions,                which allow an investigator to spend up to 24 months with $50,000                of direct cost exploring the field of embryonic stem cell research                as well as have training in the uses of stem cells.                 And then, requests for applications are directed towards areas                of scientific priorities that the NIH feels need to be stimulated.                 So we have stimulated multi-investigator teams.  We have infrastructure,                growth and maintenance, research into biochemical/molecular markers,                and so on.                 And we are trying now to establish exploratory center grants that                will lead to, then, formal centers that will have for a primary                mission the development of the applications and the basic science                of human embryonic stem cells.                 Then, obviously, as you can imagine, there is a tremendous amount                of interest in rapid application in particular disease areas.  So                institutes now have also issued very specific RFAs in avenues of                research that are deemed to be potentially fruitful in the short                term.                  So innovative concepts and approaches to developing functional                tissues and organs from NHLBI, plasticity of human stem cells in                the nervous system, and you can obviously imagine what these applications                area — recovery of cardiac function, the recovery of neural function,                recovery of endocrine function in the case of diabetes, and obviously                basic and applied stem cell for arthritis and musculoskeletal disease.                              The Institute feels that this is a high priority area, given the                fact that musculoskeletal disease and arthritis is emerging as the                number one cause of disability in an aging population.  And then,                development and repair of orofacial structures.                 I will just go quickly now in terms of some of the more fundamental                research — for example, NIDDK is promoting comprehensive programs                in beta cell biology, again a diabetic target.  And then, obviously                looking at the genome anatomy of the hematopoietic stem cells, given                the genomic techniques that are available to us, and so on.  So                I don't want to take too much of your time on details, but this                is the strategy that we have implemented.                 In addition, we have also stimulated intramural research.  When                this field started, you could basically identify one or two labs                at NIH intramural that had an interest and lead in embryonic stem                cell research.  Dr. Ron McKay, through mouse embryonic stem cells,                was probably the most prominent.                 Today we have nine laboratories in NIH working aggressively and                publishing in these areas.  We have a much expanded interest as                cell line availability becomes more straightforward.  So we knew                that that was a roadblock that needed to be overcome before anything                else could happen, and that's what we worked on.                 In addition, through the identification of roadblocks by the stem                cell task force, one of the things that became very obvious for                us, for all of us in the field, was that unless we had a formal                way of characterizing and identifying the characteristics of each                cell line, it would be very difficult to compare experiments from                lab A to lab B to lab C.                 And when we surveyed the field and we surveyed the level of knowledge                needed for characterization cell markers, molecular characteristics,                and so on, we realized that there wasn't a worldwide agreement,                nor was there a U.S. consensus about how to really make sure that                you're dealing with a stem cell, and how do you know that over                a period of time, and how do you compare line A versus line B.                 So we decided to establish an intramural research program dedicated                to the characterization of stem cell lines.  We think that this                is an important investment, because it will give us for the first                time the ability to call a stem cell a stem cell in the real scientific                sense of the way — of the word.                 So, in summary, what I think you can see between 2002 and 2003                is that we have built the infrastructure, we have accepted investigator-initiated                awards, we had 21 applications in '02.  Now remember, in NIH                parlance FY2002 goes from October 1, 2001, which was a month after                the announcement of the policy to September 30, 2002, and 27 applications                in '03.                 We have awarded 25.  We have also awarded 66 administrative supplements.                 These are scientists who have already accumulated the knowledge                base to work with stem cells, either in adult stem cells or mouse                embryonic stem cells, and we issued a rapid series of supplemental                grants to allow them to work with human embryonic stem cells.                 So we have 66 additional grantees, or groups anyway, that are                able to use human stem cells.                 We also had a research symposium in June that showcased both the                research conducted and supported by NIH, but integrated this with                the GM cell symposium that occurred here in Washington on June 10th                and 11th, to look at the entire field and try to understand where                the field was at the time.                 On the research horizon, I think what came out of those meetings                is that the priorities today are the following.  One is to define,                standardize, human ES cell culture conditions that obviate the need                for either mouse or human feeder cells.  This is a priority.  We                already have grants from investigators that have been funded.                  We have several reports from groups that have been funded by NIH                looking at the characteristics of, what is it that gives a mouse                feeder cell the ability to grow human embryonic stem cells?  What's                so special about that versus human feeder cells versus feeder-free                cells?                  And there have been recent papers that indicate that you could                — once you understand the molecular drivers of that growth, you                can probably foresee the ability for us to develop, soon I hope,                culture conditions that will obviate the need for any feeder cells.                              Then, the second is you can hear many — you can hear through the                scientific community those enabling tools and technologies to further                characterize stem cells as they become specialized cells are needed.                 And that goes from specialized antibodies to identify very specific                markers of multiple different lineages.                  But it's also a — there is also a requirement from the scientific                community to understand what the genetic events — what the gene                expression patterns are between a multipotent stem cell and the                one that becomes, let's say, a muscle cell or a blood cell.                               And that is an area of very, very important research that is ongoing,                and there have been several papers published trying to identify                which genes are really turned on or off as you go from the stem                state to a non-stem state.  And that essentially defines the point                number three, which is understanding the molecular pathways that                specify differentiation into these different specialized cells.                              And then, obviously, we're not talking about cells just in                culture.  They have to survive and function within the host, so                that many, many researchers are now focusing their attention on                the critical factors and conditions that drive the long-term survival                of these cells in the host.                 And then, obviously, the one question that requires resolution                before any human clinical trials are even envisioned is the assurance                that we need — and I lwill let my colleague Dr. Mark McClellan talk                about it — to make sure that we can control cell division and prevent                the development of a malignancy or untoward complication.                 Now, as we speak about this, you will hear that human feeder layers                are a very important step, and the research already alluded to this.                 And the point here is that until recently all human embryonic stem                cells were grown on mouse feeder layers.  And new conditions are                being established using human feeder layers.                  We know from the Johns Hopkins group there was a recent paper                from the Technion Institute in Israel about developing matrix-like                substances that grow — that can grow without human feeder cells,                these human embryonic stem cells.                 There was a publication — not a publication, but at least an announcement                from the Singapore company that you could do that.  There are at                least unpublished reports of multiple groups having worked and working                on developing these lines.                 Now, this is presented often as a sine qua non of further research.                 I'm sure that Dr. McClellan will address the issue of how you                go about qualifying any cell lines that are grown or not grown on                animal or human feeder cells.                 Now, but that is still in our mind an issue that requires work,                requires development.  It will be much more desirable for us to                have understood the culture conditions without having the variability                associated with either mouse or human feeder cells, even though                that — from the conclusions from FDA and many others — indicate                that it is not a complete obstacle to clinical trials.                  But in my mind, it's much more desirable not to have that                factor come into play at all if we can avoid it.  But it seems to                be doable, and the research is ongoing.                 Now, just quickly some important research results.  The group                at the University of Wisconsin has been able to report on homologous                recombination in stem cells.  For those of you who are not familiar                with that, it's the ability to essentially introduce genetic                material that will modify the genetic makeup of the cell, and so                that you can control — experimentally anyway — some of the characteristics                of these cells.  That is an important step, we think, in the field.                              In terms of application, you have heard about the work from Dr.                Ron McKay primarily, showing a method that can drive the differentiation                towards dopamine-secreting neurons using these in an animal model                and demonstrating, in fact, recovery of function in a model of Parkinson's                disease — very, very promising avenues of research here.                 Then, one of the key areas of research, as I indicated before,                was to identify the key genes, the master genes that control the                state of stemness that we need to understand in terms of being able                to maintain cell cultures in the state that we wish them to be in                over the long- term.  And this is a very important advance in the                sense that we are identifying now new genes.                  One is nanog — after the mythological Celtic land of eternal youth                — which basically maintains the self-renewing properties of mouse                embryonic stem cells, and he has expressed these as inner cell mass.                              You couple that with other research ongoing in human embryonic                stem cells — Dr. Rowe at the NIH, Dr. Goldman, I think, is doing                similar research — where gene array studies of these cells are coding                down on a subset of genes which seem to be essential to the stemness                state.                  So we are very hopeful that within a short period of time we will                be able to at least identify some of the key master genes that are                really at play in this type of cells.                 Then, you see advances in terms of not just looking at the stem                cell state, but looking at a differentiated state and understanding                the pathway going from stem to a specific type of cell, with multiple                papers indicating recipes at this point.  They are not well understood.                               But clearly, researchers are able to show that through multiple                approaches they can lead a cell to become, for example, a myocyte                that beats, just like a cardiac cell would, an endothelial cell                or a neuron with very specific functional measurements.  This is                the most exciting part, if you will, of the research, because it                indicates that there is really proof of concept occurring in multiple                subsystems from the same kind of cells that are being worked on.                              Duke University found that you can, in fact, grow a progenitor                — from progenitor cells myocytes.  The group in Israel also has                shown that they can differentiate human embryonic stem cells into                beating myocytes.  Clearly, both in adult stem cells and human embryonic                stem cells you see early results that seem to indicate that cardiac                function recovery can happen with stem cell therapeutic approaches.                 That's very interesting.                 Obviously, NIH supports research on many types of stem cells.                 I'm focusing my comments on human embryonic stem cells, obviously.                  But as you know, adult stem cells have been funded for many, many                years, particularly in the field of cancer and hematology malignancies.                               Just to give you a sense of the relationship, in FY2002, our investment                in human adult stem cell was over $170 million.  In FY2002, which                is the very first year of stem cell research on embryonic human                stem cells, our total investment was about $10 million.  This year's                investment is probably going to be $17-, $18-, $20 million in the                human embryonic stem cell research, and will be about the same number,                maybe $180 million, in adult stem cell research.                 This is not counting animal stem cell research on mouse embryonic                stem cells or other types of stem cells.  So as you can see, the                investment is growing.  But, again, we hope for advances in all                fields of stem cell research.                  We think that given the very early nature of our knowledge, our                understanding, and the limited nature of our understanding, it is                important to promote both areas of research, we think, at this point                as aggressively as we can.                  You know about the multipotent adult progenitor cells that Dr.                Verfaillie has developed.  It shows capabilities for self-renewal                and differentiation to many specialized cells.  I don't want                to take too much time, but we can see glial stem cells that can                produce neurons in culture — very interesting paper from Nunez.                              And satellite cells in muscle that have been identified as adult                stem cells that can divide in response to injury.  And, clearly,                some early results that indicate that we can turn on these cells,                particularly in patients with muscle-wasting diseases.                 At NIH recently there were stem cells identified in baby teeth                that have also quite a bit of potential.  So, clearly, a lot of                things are happening.  You can see also bone marrow stem cells that                are redifferentiated towards neural stem cells.                 There are a lot of questions on the mechanisms by which these                occur.  Some people feel that fusion might be the reason, rather                than just the stem redirection.  So we'll see about that as                we go forward.                 And we're providing also a large amount of information to                the research community on our websites.                 I have material here that I could give you also — I don't                know if I'm okay on time — comments about the stem cell sources                and what is really happening in terms of stem cell sources in the                world right now, to just give the Council an idea of how these things                really develop and what happens in terms of research groups using                them.                 So this is the paper that I wanted to mention.   By the way, before                I go into that area, there's a paper from Hubner in  Science                 using mouse embryonic stem cells.  They were able to generate what                appeared to be oocyte-like cells in vitro.                  This is the very first paper on an animal system that seemed to                indicate that you can revert from the pluripotent state to the totipotent                state.  It is not confirmed at this point.  We don't really                know that the — what they look at and define as structures resembling                blastocysts in the petri dish are really blastocysts, whether they                have the potential or not.                 If these experiments can be repeated in human embryonic stem cells,                there will be important implications for the creation of new cell                lines, generation of tissue, and so on.  So this is a paper that                I think the Council should pay attention to, because it is quite                surprising actually to see these events in these oocyte-like — in                these culture conditions.                 So in terms of cell sources, the first one that was available                was the H1 line from Wisconsin.  It has about 300 vials in inventory.                 It has shipped already about 105 orders.  About 78 of these were                in U.S. institutions, and the rest was overseas.                  And then, the cell characteristics are quite well defined, and                these cells seem to — these are the most healthy it looks like,                from the point of view of passages.  These cells are in passage                22 and are available immediately.  So this is a very healthy colony                that seems to grow to the right number with a limited number of                passages.                 H7 is another line.  They have just made this one available.                 Obviously, it's now commercially available, has slightly different                characteristics.  And H9 has — there are about 10 orders that have                been fulfilled with H9.  These have all been made available in the                past four or five months, so it's not ? and, again, 10 orders                have been filled in.                 The major other source is BresaGen from Athens, Georgia.  It has                two lines available.  These lines also have interesting characteristics.                 You can see they have shipped eight total lines — five in the U.S.,                one to the U.K., Israel, and Australia.                 In the world of research in stem cells, the countries that were                just mentioned seem to be the most active, because there is a heterogeneity                in the policies of the different countries as you well know.                 From ES Cell International, there are five lines available, and                there were about 33 international shipments and 16 U.S. shipments                from this Australian source.  We have a source in Korea.  It has                one line.  There were 20 shipments made, 17 to Korea, and three                to the U.S., all of which were sent to the NIH for the purpose of                that — of characterization of the lines.                 UCSF has now one line commercially available and has 60 vials                in inventory, has shipped 19 — 15 to the U.S. and four to foreign                sources.  And I guess those are the reports I wanted to give you.                              And I'd be happy to take questions, Dr. Kass.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very, very much, for a thorough,                illuminating presentation.                  Let me remind the Council that Dr. Zerhouni has a 3:00 departure.                 Let's try to keep the questions brief, and no speeches.  The                floor is open.  Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I certainly speak, I'm sure, for                the rest of the Council.  We very much appreciate your taking the                time to come and update us on the current status, and certainly                the plans — the present implementation and the plans for the future                I think are ones that many of us would applaud.                 I have a series of questions.  One of the first is for the cell                lines not established on feeder layers, this implies that there                will be new ES cell lines developed.  And so the question is, these                would then not fall within President Bush's August 9th cutoff                date.  And I guess, is that really so?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   No.  Actually, we did an inventory just                prior to a hearing to just make sure that we had all our facts together.                 There were several sources — in other words, institutions or companies                — that had derived cell lines already by August 9th.  They have                not exposed all of their lines to human — to mouse feeder cell lines.                               And, in particular, we have specific information on the lines                in Sweden — Gutenberg and the Karolinska — whereby the — as you                saw in the process, there is a process of — where between derivation                and exposure to mouse feeder cell lines you can freeze the lines                and keep them.                 So there are at least those, which is about 16 lines, I believe,                that have not been exposed to either mouse or human cell — human                feeder cell lines.                  And the reason given to us by the investigator is very simple.                 They thought that the field was not mature enough, and the understanding                of the culture conditions was not there.  So I think what they're                doing is they are basically doing experiments on non-approved U.S.                cell lines, non-approved by — for federal funding, and they have                reported, for example, experiments where they are trying to use                methods that will require neither human or mouse feeder cell lines.                              And they stated very clearly that once they master those techniques,                they will then apply them to the federally fundable cell lines.                               DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.  The next question is:  what kind of                restrictions on intellectual property are attached to the lines?                 For example, those from the University of Wisconsin, because I understood                that there were certain very important restrictions.  And I know                also that NIH was trying to get some of those modified, and I wondered                what the current status was.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Right.  Basically, the restrictions are,                one, the recipients cannot implant the provider cells in the uterus,                mix the cells with an intact embryo, or attempt to make a whole                embryo.  The recipients and recipient institutions are free to publish                their research results as they wish.  The providers retain ownership                of the original material.  So WiCell retains ownership of the original                materials and any unmodified derivatives.                 However, the recipient institutions own any new materials and                inventions its researchers create.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Those are the agreements that NIH negotiated                with WiCell, and made those agreements transferrable to NIH-funded                investigators.                 The provider of the cells can request a sample of any new materials                for internal research users.  So WiCell could request samples from                the university to develop something new for their own research,                and is free to use that for its own internal programs — any newly                patented invention.  So WiCell essentially is saying that if somebody                discovers something, they can use that for their own needs internally.                              Other restrictions — basically, the main restriction is that WiCell,                for example, granted any PHS-funded nonprofit investigators the                right to use its patented technology, and granted a royalty-free                non-commercial research license to PHS-funded researchers as long                — and this is the real important statement — as long as the agreements                with such third parties were no more onerous than those in the WiCell                agreement.                 And WiCell specifically excludes sponsored research where the                research sponsor gives commercial rights to a third party.  In other                words, let's say, you know, Dr. Foster receives cells at UT                Southwestern, and then using those cells and whatever discovery                he or she makes, goes to a third party and conveys commercial rights                without WiCell being — having its right respected.                 So those are the interesting issues I think that govern that.                               DR. ROWLEY:   Can I ask you just one more question, which                there is — in Britain, the MRC is trying to develop a cell bank,                and I just — presumably, it would be parallel with the cell bank                that's being developed at NIH.  And is there any collaboration                or coordination of efforts?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Okay.  Let's be careful.  NIH is not                developing a cell bank.  It's developing a cell characterization                unit.  In other words, we will develop the reagents, we will have                the lines that we will compare, and we will do a full catalog of                all of the characteristics that researchers tell us are very important.                 Make the reagents available, make the antibodies available.  We're                not going to be distributors of cell lines as we speak.                 The British model is a little different.  They have a commission,                obviously, that approves or disapproves requests, and all lines                developed under that policy have to be deposited in the cell bank.                              To my knowledge, to this — I think last week there was an announcement                that the first line had been successfully derived.  And, therefore,                those derivers have the obligation to deposit that in the British                bank for wider distribution.  So they're assuming, if you will,                the infrastructure role that we granted to the sources here, they're                assuming it within the cell bank.                 Any collaborations we communicate constantly.  The most important                areas of collaboration, from my standpoint, are we need to understand                the characteristics of cell lines.  We need to exchange information.                 We need to have a more formal way of understanding what the field                is doing worldwide.  And those are the things that we're doing                with the MRC and others.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Gazzaniga.                  DR. GAZZANIGA:   I just think it's important to get                the scale down here.  So in terms of current embryonic stem cell                research, the investment at NIH is .1 percent of your budget.  It's                extremely small.  Would you — what would be your guess that — should                more cell lines be made available through a change in the current                policy?  How fast do you think that would scale up to be more in                line with adult stem cell vessels?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I don't think the limiting factor is                the cell lines.  I really don't.  I really think the limiting                factor is human capital and trained human capital that can quickly                evaluate a wide range of research avenues in stem cells.                 So I am not of the opinion that the number of stem cells — you                can see the shipments, how many have been requested, and there are                many more available.  So I think it's more important to stimulate                the field at the human capital level in my mind, and it will take                — as you know, it takes time.  You have to have fellowships.  You                have to have centers.                  You have to have young post-docs that really get involved in the                field and have new publications and ideas and grants of their own                for that to grow.  It's not something you can, you know, drive                top-down, I don't think.                  DR. ROWLEY:   And just in that vein, your slides showed                that there were three post-doctoral fellowships awarded in FY02,                and out of four applicants.  So this highlights, I think, the problem                of human capital.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I think you're right.  But we see a                lot of is in the applications that are granted, R01 types or program,                what you see is that post-docs tend to be funded through those grants                directly, without going through a fellowship route.  But I think                you're making a good point, and we want to stimulate that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut.                  DR. HURLBUT:   I want to clarify something.  The 16 cell                lines — I think that's what you said that were not grown on                mouse feeder cells — are those part of the original 70 designations?                               DR. ZERHOUNI:   That's correct.  I don't know if                it's 16 or 12.  I mean, I can give you the exact information,                but it's about that number.                  DR. HURLBUT:   These were essentially disaggregated and                then frozen.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Right.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Doesn't it stand to reason that given                the months preceding this policy there might be thousands of such                disaggregated embryos out there?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Do you mean between August — prior to August                1 — August 2001?                  DR. HURLBUT:   Everybody saw it coming, right?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I'm sorry?                  DR. HURLBUT:   Everybody saw it coming, that there might                be such a policy that would say, ""No further derivations.""                 Isn't it possible that there are quite a few cell lines out                there?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I wasn't at NIH at the time.  But I                can tell you that the NIH staff that worked on that truly canvassed                the world and made sure that whatever lines there was documentation,                there was informed consent, there are some — so it may be that there                are lines out there that have been derived before August 9th, but                they may not fit all of the other characteristics — informed consent,                no inducement, and so on.                 I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't                think there are thousands out there that were waiting for the policy                to come out.                  DR. HURLBUT:   I shouldn't have said thousands.  It                was a hyperbole.                 But let me ask you two other specific questions.  As you characterize                these cells and understand the molecular signals, and so forth,                obviously the hope is that you can derive them without creating                embryos somehow back — pull them down or something.  Is there any                special program that NIH is looking at in an effort to bypass the                moral problem?  And would it be reasonable to fund such a specialized                effort?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I thought you were the program to do that                here.                 (Laughter.)                 I think Dr. Kass is in charge of that program.                 (Laughter.)                 No.  I don't think there is a particular program that scientifically                could look at the moral or ethical issues.  There is no question                that we have in every one of our human subjects and animal subjects                a — you know, a very strong moral and ethical review based on institutional                review boards or the — you know, the typical ethical considerations                that you attach to research.                 But I think this one is not something that NIH is looking into,                feeling, and I said that in jest, but I think it's serious.                 I think all of the institutions that have looked at this issue would                be the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine.                 The administration feels that this is a debate that really needs                to happen in forums like this one.                  I don't know if I'm answering your question.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Well, I didn't really mean debate it.                 I mean, I think everybody agrees if you could de-differentiate an                adult cell down to an ES cell, a pluripotent cell, without making                it totipotent, that you would have a moral solution to the derivation                of ES cells.  And I just wondered if there's — if the science                might be ripe for a special program to seek those avenues and what                you might call morally derived ES cells.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Well, that's the adult stem cell program                in some ways.  That's what Dr. Verfaillie is trying to do by                using adult stem cells.  And then, going back in history and trying                to de-differentiate them, that's really the — now that I understand                your question, I mean, that is the hope of those investigators.                 Cord blood was another source that is used that does not have the                same moral connotation as human embryonic stem cells derived from                embryos.                 So yes, actually, if that's — I'm sorry.  I didn't                quite understand your question.  But absolutely, there are — as                you can see, there is a tremendous amount of activity in adult stem                cells and understanding the differentiation pathways.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have a couple of questions as well.                 In part, you give the impression that we're still at a very                early stage in the road from the bench to the bedside.  And you've                indicated at least some of the obstacles that — some of the steps                that would have to be taken and some of the obstacles in the way.                              One of the things that you didn't speak about was research                addressed to the immunoprotection problem.  And I wonder whether                there are special efforts in that area with respect to stem cell                research.                 And, second, notwithstanding the fact that we seem to be at a                very, very early stage in this research, you do indicate that there                is some work going on to look for fairly immediate clinical payoffs,                say in the area of cardiac disease.                 I wasn't absolutely clear that that was with human ES cell                — with cells derived from human sources or not.  But how do you                square the sense that on the one hand we are at a very, very early                stage, and on the other hand the field might be ripe already for                certain kinds of clinical trials.  What message should we take away                on that particular point?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I think I may not have — I may not have                been clear, but what I refer to as ""host cell interactions""                imply immunological responses.  We need to understand those.  We                need to clearly make sure that either the transplant is not destroyed,                nor is the transplant left to grow in an uncontrolled fashion.                 So I didn't mean to ignore those issues.  They are there,                and they need to be addressed.                 Now, science, as you can imagine, advances by leaps and bounds,                and investigators have passion and sometimes believe there is a                shortcut or not a shortcut.  So that the two areas of research that                I think are driven to applications are those that, through what                I call, you know, recipes or lucky strikes or understanding of pathways,                whatever it is, try to find an application, a path to application,                in a proof of concept fashion, usually in animal systems.                 And that's really what researchers tend to do.  In other words,                you try to build from the solid ground you're at, and then you                go out and build an island, and then you fill in the blanks.                 The fill in the blanks are still in the basic region that I described.                 Even if you showed today that there was a recovery of cardiac function                through some pathway, you still will have to do the demonstration                that you understand the host cell interaction, you understand immune                response, you understand all of the safety considerations, and so                on.                 So I don't mean — in my view, they are not incompatible with                each other.  At least the characterizations I gave are very compatible.                               What happens typically in biomedical research, you have multiple                avenues, and that's the strength I think is to let people demonstrate                that.  Your question about, is it in humans — adult stem cells have                been reported to have been used in humans in Italy, in Brazil, from                bone marrow sources.  So adult sources that have then been implanted                in the heart, it is not clear, really, that it is the implantation                of those adult stem cells that has accomplished the result.                 We've had embryonic stem cells injected in rat hearts that                have been infarcted that showed recovery.  But those are proof of                concept experiments.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 Bill May.                  DR. MAY:   At one point you talked about arcing back from                pluripotent to totipotent.  Is a reversal from pluripotent to totipotent                in effect the creation of a new cell line?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   That's a very, very difficult question                for me to answer, because there's one experiment that showed                that, at least on the surface in a mouse model, that you had structures                that seemed to form not only a totipotent cell but an oocyte-like                structure.  So that — a blastocyst-like structure.                 So the question is:  are you creating a new cell line, or are                you creating a new organism — is not clear in that.  But this is                a very early area of research at this point.                  DR. MAY:   It does bear on the August 11th cutoff date I                guess, doesn't it?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   It could.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael, and then Janet.                  DR. GAZZANIGA:   Just a followup, because I think your point                on the human capital is important.  Sort of in the labs in various                biomedical institutions, there's an unwillingness on the part                of many young investigators to go into this field because of the                uncertainty of its political scientific status.                 And so there's an interaction here where if it was clear that                this program is going to move forward, it was clear that there are                going to be more lines developed, because certainly more lines are                going to be needed for a variety of biomedical issues, that the                human capital aspect of it might be solved very quickly.                 Certainly, that is what happens in all other fields which are                not constrained by the sort of — these sort of political moral issues.                 But if there's a new technique, gene expression work — as you                know, overnight it remade the field, the DNA chips, and so forth.                              So if it was clear what the policy would be in the future, wouldn't                your guess be that the human capital part would be solved rather                quickly?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Again, that's a question that goes from                a premise that there is an issue.  Clearly, when you look at the                increase in publications and names on publications, you see a lot                of new entrants.  I wasn't at the first meeting at NIH two years                ago about these issues, but the symposium that we had in June, 600                people all supported in some fashion or another.   How you compare                that to another field, I don't know.                 The other anecdotal piece of information is I visited a few sites,                and they don't report a dearth of post-doc candidates for their                programs.  Once they're established, you see — if you go to                Jamie Thomson, he has a tremendous amount of required — or demand                for trainees to come into his program as post-docs.                 And so once you have an established program, it seems like you                are able to attract people.  If you go to an institution where there's                no leader, no established program — I knew from my experience at                Hopkins, John Gearhart, he had his pick.  I mean, he could choose                whoever wanted to come.  So I think it's the program that drives                the young investigators to enter the field — program with funding,                with available resources.                 Is the fact that cell lines are under the policy a driver of going                and not going into the field?  I don't have the answer to that.                 But obviously, since this is an issue of federal funding, private                funding is also available, an avenue that is not prohibited, as                you know.  And the biotech industry — there was a recent report                that shows that there is still quite a bit of activity in the biotech                — and growing activity in the biotech industry for stem cell research.                              So I'm not sure that from the standpoint of human capital                that there is a monofactor here that you can identify, saying, ""Well,                this will prevent for sure the growth of human capital.""  I                can't answer that question in the affirmative.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Last question before we let Dr. Zerhouni                go.  Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Do you have any estimate — it would have                to be crude, I assume — as to how much money private sources are                putting into stem cell research?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Actually, there's a paper that was published                just recently, and I can give you a copy of it.  And this is not                an NIH study, but I understand that there is spending of $200 million                per year in stem cell research, embryonic stem cell research, and                1,000 FTEs, full-time equivalents doing research worldwide.                 About 60 percent of those are in the United States, about 15 in                Europe, and 27 percent in the rest of the world, primarily Australia,                Singapore, Korea, Japan.  I have that reference if you want it.                               PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Actually, if you can take one more, Janet                had been on the list — if you'll make it brief.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I just want to make a question and a comment.                 The comment is actually related to Kay Hubner's paper in  Science ,                and I think that it is important to recognize that this is work                that was done in the mouse.  And we've had a great deal of difficulty                in terms of translating success in the mouse and other animals into                humans, so this is going to take some time.                 The question is you mentioned that there is a program at NIH now                for characterizing these cells, and I wondered what institute it                was housed in.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   The Institute — NINDS, neurological diseases,                under — actually, it's associated with Ron McKay's laboratory,                because we feel he has the best expertise in that area.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dr. Zerhouni, thank you very, very much                for a wonderful presentation and very frank discussion.  We really                appreciate your presence.  Thank you.                 (Applause.)                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   As we learned from Dr. Zerhouni, we are                at a relatively early stage in our journey from basic stem cell                research to therapeutic benefits.  And as one looks ahead down this                road, we see in advance the important role that the FDA is going                to play in verifying the efficacy and the safety of any eventual                stem-based — stem cell based therapies.                 In recent months, the FDA issued its guidance regarding xenotransplantation,                the introduction into human beings of materials of animal origin                or derived from materials having contact with animal tissues.                 Almost immediately, there were press reports, many of them grossly                off the mark, about what this guidance might mean for the possibility                of future clinical trials using material derived from the Presidential                cell lines.                 To help us separate fact from fiction, and, more importantly,                to help us understand how the oversight and regulatory activities                of the FDA might eventually figure in the area of stem cell based                therapies, we're very fortunate to have with us Dr. Mark McClellan,                who is the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.                 Dr. McClellan, many thanks to you for taking the time to help                us understand this important aspect of the road that we are on that                will take us from the bench to the bedside.  Welcome.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Thank you, Dr. Kass.  And all of you on                this distinguished Council, thank you for inviting me here today                to discuss the role of the FDA in helping to make new safe and effective                xenotransplantation treatments available, including potentially                valuable stem cell treatments.                 FDA's job is to protect and advance the public health, and                one of our primary responsibilities involves helping safe and effective                products reach patients and consumers quickly.                 Our Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which I'm                sure many of you are familiar with — goes by the acronym CBER —                has the lead in FDA for regulating xenotransplantation, including                emerging cellular therapies.  FDA regulates cellular therapies under                broad authority from the Public Health Service Act and the Federal                Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.                 Under this authority, FDA has taken many steps to foster the development                of safe and effective stem cell therapies, while assuring appropriate                protections for human subjects involved in the research.                 As you know, xenotransplantation is a set of procedures that includes                the transplantation or implantation into a person of live cells                from non-human animal sources, including human cells that have had                ex vivo contact with live non-human animal cells or tissues.                 And as you just heard from Dr. Zerhouni, recent evidence suggests                that transplantation of cells and tissues may one day provide many                important therapeutic benefits for diseases such as neurodegenerative                disorders, diabetes, many other conditions involving organ dysfunctions                and cellular dysfunctions.  Because the potential health benefits                may be considerable, it's appropriate that there are many clinical                research and development studies going on now to better characterize                the risk and benefits of these potentially important treatments.                              Xenotransplantation products, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic                Act are treated in accordance with our statutory provisions governing                premarket development.  And so they are subject to FDA review and                approval.  Investigators of such products should obtain FDA review                of proposed xenotransplantation clinical trials before proceeding.                              In addition to providing necessary assurances of protection for                human research subjects, FDA takes many steps in its regulatory                oversight to help researchers and product developers avoid mistakes                and translate good research ideas into safe and effective treatments                as efficiently as possible.                 And in an area as complex and with as many practical uncertainties                as stem cell research, this regulatory guidance can be extremely                helpful for obtaining the most public health benefit from basic                science insights.  For example, applied research conducted at CBER                has been instrumental in improving our understanding of safety issues                associated with xenotransplantation.                 CBER is engaged in a range of scientific investigation of safety                issues, including on known and emerging infectious agents, immunological                issues, transfer and differentiation issues, and others that will                need to be overcome for the safe and effective use of xenotransplantation                products.                 The results of these studies have helped CBER in its safety assessment,                including assessment of risk and the development of better diagnostic                methods and standards to assess risks.  CBER researchers are continuing                to develop assays appropriate for safety monitoring and are working                with sponsors and collaborating with other government scientists                in the development of these assays.                 In addition, to improve our regulatory policies related to xenotransplantation,                CBER working groups are analyzing data and events and developing                and proposing strategies for appropriate studies, for risk assessment,                for prevention, for communication, and agency response or regulatory                action, such as requests for more data from sponsors or for particular                product assays and the course of clinical investigation, or, when                necessary, the placement of clinical holds on clinical investigations.                              We discuss all of these proposals and strategies with our advisory                committees when needed or at public meetings as appropriate to make                sure we've got full opportunities for public comment on the                most effective way to regulate these important but complex new areas                of medical technology.                 CBER has also developed a mechanism for the systematic and regular                evaluation of the scientific and clinical literature relevant to                xenotransplantation as well as careful scientific evaluation of                the submissions that we get in our xenotransplantation product files.                              If you put all of that together, that not only the research studies                but what we see in terms of the studies, the details of the studies                that are ongoing now, not just the published studies but the ongoing                work, this amounts to the most extensive data available on the practical                application of stem cell technologies.                 We have a xenotransplantation product review or working group,                which consists of the review staff responsible for the review of                xenotransplantation submissions, the clinical product and pharmacology                and toxicology reviewers, as well as our veterinary staff.                  They all meet regularly to discuss application of the principles                that are in our relevant regulations and guidances to review and                discuss current scientific and medical data and literature relevant                to xenotransplantation, to review and discuss the current status                of xenotransplantation applications that are before the agency,                to discuss, the unique issues that these products may present and                to highlight areas of concern where further expert advice and solicitation                of public opinion, and outside expertise may be needed.                 This working group structure gives us an approach — gives us a                consistent and up-to-date review approach for xenotransplantation                applications, and it helps us recognize patterns or trends or common                problems that may be associated with xenotransplantation products,                and, again, a highly — a new and high emerging research area.  And                it should be communicated to xenotransplantation product developers                and other interested parties in a timely way.                 Our data evaluation and management process is linked to this regulatory                process, and it's applied during regulatory decisionmaking and                product and policy design at the agency.  We have augmented our                own experience with cell therapies by sponsoring and participating                in a large number of open public meeting and workshops, both domestic                and international, that focus in whole or in part on cellular therapies.                               These activities are essential for both sharing information and                receiving public input on relevant issues.  To make sure that our                insights and our assistance reach those involved in planning stem                cell trials effectively, FDA has also been proactive in educational                partnerships, workshops, and guidance development.                  And this work collectively includes discussing preclinical pharmacology                and toxicology studies, and good clinical practices, and product                characterization studies — all difficult issues that need to be                addressed effectively in these emerging sciences.                 All of this work is intended to support our goal of helping clinical                research and development of stem cell therapies proceed as efficiently                as possible.  And our extensive experience with cell therapy clinical                trials, and the processes for obtaining effective outside expertise,                has helped a wide variety of clinical studies involving xenotransplantation                of stem cells proceed with public confidence about safety and without                avoidable costs or complications for the subjects involved.                 With respect to the details of our oversight of clinical xenotransplantation                studies, as in other areas, FDA allows INDs — investigational new                drug applications — for these trials to proceed as long as they                don't pose unreasonable risks to the human subjects.                 Reflecting both the flexibility of our risk-based regulatory framework                and the energy of this important new research area, well over 1,000                separate INDs for all forms of cell therapies have been implemented                over the past decade.  Hundreds of subjects, hundreds of human subjects,                have received experimental products comprised of animal cells or                human cells that have had contact with animal cells since the early                1990s under FDA oversight.                 Hundreds of additional human subjects have been treated with a                human skin cell product called Epicell that was grown on mouse feeder                cell layers.  FDA discussed this Epicell product at a public advisory                meeting in January 2000, and we agreed with the advisory committee's                conclusion that the safety data concerning the use of the well characterized                mouse feeder cells in this case was sufficient to allow clinical                trials to proceed generally.                 And that is, the lesson here is that when murine cells can be                characterized as in this Epicell product, then as a general regulatory                matter there is no overarching need for monitoring and surveillance                with respect to this particular safety concern.                 FDA is continuing to support the development of safe and effective                cellular therapies, and we work directly with sponsors to help ensure                that all promising therapies can be clinically evaluated in an ethically                sound, scientifically rigorous, and efficient manner.                 The agency evaluates each individual product on its own merits.                 FDA's regulations, our guidances, and our policies, provide                useful information on safety and product development issues to help                sponsors interested in development of cellular products.                 CBER's regulatory guidance and regulations are continuing                to evolve, and this is appropriate to ensure that the continued                advancement of a very dynamic and growing field is matched by continuing                advancement in our regulatory guidances to support it.                 The hundreds of patients that have been treated in clinical trials                in which non-human animal cells have been implanted or infused directly,                or in which human cells that have had ex vivo contact with animal                cells have been administered, have been treated using protocols                that meet FDA safety standards.                 For Phase I or early clinical trials, the most important aspect                of safety is the demonstration of the products not contaminated                with adventitious infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria,                fungi, and so forth.  This safety criterion needs to be met, and                it has been met by most FDA-regulated products, including biological                products, before they can be used in the clinic.                 For all cellular products, including human cells, non-human cells,                animal cells, or human cells that have been exposed to such cells,                which often can't be tested for sterility prior to administration                because they can't always be stored, FDA has pursued a flexible                approach that does not compromise patient safety.  In particular,                FDA has allowed sponsors to administer the cells based on the results                of interim, in-process, bacterial and fungal sterility testing in                which the absence of infectious agents is demonstrated.                 The sponsors then perform sterility tests on the final product,                though results are frequently not available until after the products                have been administered.  A positive sterility test on the final                product is quite rare if the interim tests have been negative.                 But if the result is positive on the final test, the results of                these sterility tests are used to inform subsequent patient treatment.                              To address potential viral contaminants, FDA requests that prescreening                of components that could introduce viral infections occur.  For                example, before using porcine tests in humans, sponsors have been                asked to demonstrate that the pig tissue that they use doesn't                produce infectious porcine endogenous retrovirus.                 In the case of Epicell that I mentioned a few minutes ago, the                manufacturer was able to use standard techniques to show that the                transmission of murine viruses to the co-cultured human cells shouldn't                be a problem.  As a safety net, the recipients of animal cells or                human cells exposed to non-human animal cells are monitored for                unexpected infectious diseases.                 When human cells are transferred from one human to other humans,                whether or not animal cells enter the equation, FDA asks that the                human cells, and, if possible, the donors of those cells be thoroughly                tested for known viruses.  So we've overseen treatment of thousands                of patients with human cells or with animal cells, or with human                cells that have been exposed to animal cells, in which the transmission                of infection has been tightly controlled.                 Human embryonic stem cells are just one type of living human cells                among the many somatic cellular therapies that FDA regulates.  Most                of the issues that will be involved in the production of human embryonic                stem cells for clinical use are shared with these other cell therapies.                 Of course, there has been a high level of interest, as I've                heard in my time here today, in the research involving particular                human embryonic stem cell lines that are listed in the NIH registry.                              Just about all of these cell lines — all of these cell lines have                been in ex vivo contact with live, non-human animal cells or tissues.                 And the exposure of such human cells to animal cells, though, represents                only one of a large number of issues to be considered in evaluating                the development and use of human embryonic stem cells.                 Among the many further technical challenges to be addressed are                the manufacture and testing of the human embryonic stem cell products,                preclinical testing of human embryonic stem cells in animals to                show potential clinical benefit as well as potential toxicities,                appropriate clinical trial design issues, and appropriate followup                of human subjects treated with human embryonic stem cells.                 And our regulations and our guidance has to address that whole                panoply of issues.  Recognizing the potential importance of new                cellular therapies that may be derived from these cells, FDA extended                an invitation to each of the derivers of the NIH registry cell lines                to meet and discuss critical issues pertaining to the derivation                of these lines to help us assure safety in the clinical studies.                              We discussed FDA expectations of safety, and we gained insights                from the derivers on how they can best meet those expectations.                 We also gathered information from the derivers of the HES cell lines                regarding specific methods of preparation and propagation of the                cells to add to our understanding of the manufacturing of these                novel cell lines.                 FDA is in the process of publishing a series of guidance documents                through a notice and comment process to assist sponsors and investigators                interested in conducting clinical trials in the field of xenotransplantation.                               These documents are providing reasonably detailed and timely pragmatic                guidance to sponsors regarding xenotransplantation product safety                and clinical trial development, including specific recommendations                for how FDA believes that studies can be conducted efficiently and                with adequate safety assurances.                 The guidances that we published so far include a guidance for                industry for human somatic cell therapy and gene therapy published                in 1998, a guidance for reviewers on instructions and templates                for chemistry, manufacturing, and control of human somatic stem                cell investigational therapies, published in the past year.                 And, in addition, earlier this year we published a new xenotransplantation                guidance for industry entitled ""Source Animal Product Preclinical                and Clinical Issues Concerning the Use of Xenotransplantation Products                in Humans.""  All of these guidances are available online at                FDA.  We also recently just this past month published a draft guidance                for our reviewers to go along with this xenotransplantation guidance                for industry.                 These guidances provide information to sponsors interested in                developing products that include animal cells or exposure to animal                cells.  All of the human stem cell lines, as I mentioned earlier,                are subject to this guidance.                  And the goal here is to provide a comprehensive approach for the                regulation of xenotransplantation that efficiently addresses the                potential public health and safety issues associated with xenotransplantation,                and at the same time to provide guidance to sponsors, manufacturers,                and investigators regarding xenotransplantation product safety and                how to conduct clinical trial design and monitoring.                 One of the many issues that's addressed in the guidance is                the development of human embryonic stem cells that have had ex vivo                contact with mouse cells in clinical trials.  In our guidance, we                note that this guidance is relevant to all of the stem cell lines,                all of the human embryonic stem cell lines that have used mouse                feeder cell layers, and so fit into — this fits into the definition                of xenotransplantation used in our guidance and in our broader public                health service guidances.                 FDA has had a number of meetings, as I said, with the derivers                of these stem cell lines, and what the guidance focuses on is that                certain precautions are required to maintain the safe use of any                xenotransplantation product.  In the case of the existing embryonic                stem cell lines, the precautions include appropriate testing of                cells in mice if the mouse feeder cell layers continue to be used                for adventitious agents.                 This testing is manageable and is readily available and achievable                using current technologies.  So our xenotransplantation guidance                provides some specific, useful steps that sponsors can and should                take to address safety concerns.  A sponsor who wishes to investigate                a stem cell product derived from existing human embryonic stem cell                lines in a clinical trial may need to demonstrate to FDA that the                stem cell line is free from infectious agents, including the murine                infectious agents.                 Given the current technologies available as described in the guidance,                this should be feasible without undue burden.  The same recommendations                apply to other xenotransplantation products that contain human cells                with a history of co-culture with non-human animal cells.                 So overall we are very committed at FDA to evaluating each specific                product that comes into us on a case-by-case basis.  We try to augment                this with guidance to make it as straightforward as possible.  And                this is important, because in a world where most clinical trials                and most products that enter clinical development fail to show benefit,                each new individual proposed clinical study might still provide                a crucial step forward.                 There are multitudes of patients who have yet to benefit from                the biotechnology revolution, and as a public health agency we are                committed to making sure that every experimental product to be tested                in humans is as safe as possible, with the ultimate goal of getting                safe and effective products as quickly as possible.                 I want to thank you all for listening to me today, giving an overview                of FDA's regulatory and guidance activities in this important                area of emerging science, and I'd be pleased to answer any questions                that you all might have.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                  Dan Foster, are you on the way to — no, I'm sorry.                 Let me start and, first of all, thank you, really, for a very                comprehensive and helpful account.  And I emphasize that because                I'm going to ask a sort of flat-footed and dumb couple of questions.                 If I wanted to say, Dr. McClellan, the take-home lesson, if I wanted                to sort of put it in a nutshell, would be xenotransplantation involving                stem cells in contact with murine cells, we have experience with                that, and we are careful.                  We know what to do, and it's — while it's something to                be paid attention to, it's not an insurmountable obstacle or                one that deserves extra special attention.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   We've certainly had experience, successful                experience, in thousands of patients in documenting the safety of                cells that have been exposed to animal feeder cells, mouse feeder                cells, and the like.                  The other take-home lesson that I think is important is that while                this is a very important emerging area of technology, this is a                quite complex cellular therapy that presents many new safety issues                as well as effectiveness issues that have to be evaluated.                  And we've got multiple parallel efforts to try to assess and                help manage and address the different risks that are involved in                stem cell therapy treatments, so that we can hopefully as a result                get more rapid development of stem cell therapies that really work,                and that can be used widely.                  But as is the case with all of the biologicals, especially complex                new technologies like this, ultimately it's nature that determines                whether the products are really going to benefit the needy if we                can — and we need to unlock, through a whole — evaluation of a whole                host of complex safety and effectiveness issues, whether they can                — whether those benefits can be demonstrably given to patients.                 And we're still very early on in that process.                 And the mouse feeder cell issues are one area where we have a                regulatory process in place to address it, but there are many other                safety and effectiveness concerns that remain to be addressed, and                that we're working hard to help product developers address effectively.                                                   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  And let me just very quickly                — am I right in thinking that cells grown on human feeder cell layers                would be subjected to — have to be subjected to the same kinds of                —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Yes, they do.  They are incorporated in                our same xenotransplantation guidance, and they are subject to the                same kind of evaluation of potential exposure to adventitious infectious                agents.  They need to go through the same kind of testing procedures                and the like.                                CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 Questions or comments?  Dr. Gómez-Lobo.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   This is a question out of total                ignorance.  I have great confidence in FDA.  In fact, I think it's                a great institution and —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   I do, too.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Well, I'm glad you do.  But                here's my question.  I'm also convinced that human knowledge                is very limited, and you speak with great confidence about identifying                bacteria and viruses, etcetera.  Could it be the case that at a                nano level there might be problems, say, with some of these products                that we cannot yet detect?                  In other words, what I'm thinking about is, what's the                next step when we go into, say, gene therapy and that kind of thing?                 Is FDA going to be able to detect any problems with that?  Should                we be cautious, or should we just trust FDA and just rush forward?                  In other words, it's a very general, sort of prudential question                that I'm raising.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Yes, that is a good general question.                 FDA is not usually accused of making people rush forward, but glad                to hear that's —                 (Laughter.)                 — the perception in at least some corridors.                 These are very challenging new technologies, and there's a                great scientific concept out there and a great potential.  And that's                something that generates a lot of media interest, and the like,                and holds out a lot of hope.  I think, you know, with some reason                that we are going to be able to bring new benefits, important new                benefits, to many millions of patients that don't have effective                treatments available today.                 But as with so many other areas of emerging technologies, moving                from ideas that seem to work well even at the proof of concept stage,                to treatments that demonstrably can be shown reliably to be safe                and effective in patients is very difficult.  And we are early in                that process now for these complex biological treatments.                 I have talked a lot about some of the issues related to transmission                of infectious diseases related to feeder cells, because that's                gotten a lot of the attention.  But you're absolutely right                that there are a host of other important safety issues and effectiveness                issues that also need to be much better understood before these                treatments can be used reliably and confidently by the public to                improve the health of the public.                 And that's what this investigational process is really all                about.  That's why we have a comprehensive guidance for the                INDs involving stem cell therapies and many other types of therapies                as well, so that we can conduct those studies in a way that's                — that relies on the best-available knowledge as to whether we're                presenting patients with unreasonable risk.                 We can do it in a controlled setting, so that we can learn from                the latest studies and add to the state of knowledge that exists                from what goes before.  And then we can modify our research protocols                and guidances and research activities accordingly.                 But this is a difficult process.  You know, a lot of people talk                about the fact that it takes over a decade for going from — for                something as simple as a small molecule drug, just a simple chemical,                from the time that it's first identified and people first suspect                that it's going to have a benefit in patients.  It can take                well over a decade to go from that proof of concept to a product                being commercially available to the public.                 It's a long, complicated process.  And these complex biological                treatments and cellular therapies are far more complex and have                far more potential interactions and consequences that are not well                understood than a simple small molecule drug.                  So this is an ongoing process, a careful one, and I don't                think we're rushing headlong into this.  But at the same time,                I want to make sure that our regulatory staff is apprised of all                of the latest science, is working closely with researchers and others                involved in product development, to make sure that we're making                the most of the available knowledge, both for the sake of the patients                that are involved in these clinical studies and for the sake of                creating the knowledge base we need to get safe and effective treatments                to patients as quickly as possible.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Rebecca Dresser.                   PROF. DRESSER:   Thank you very much for your overview.                 I guess a comment and a question.  I do think it's interesting                there has been so much in the press about this particular issue                as a potential safety issue as I think you've observed, compared                to other safety issues that this technology might present such as                tumor risk and, you know, the ability to channel the cells into                the —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Pluripotency.                   PROF. DRESSER:   — appropriate tissue, and all of those                things.  So it seems that in some ways you and your colleagues are                being forced to address this issue, at least publicly, with more                attention than these other issues.  And I'm glad to hear that                you're thinking about these other issues.                 But I guess just to play devil's advocate, isn't there                a risk with xenotransplants that there is an undetected animal virus,                an undetectable virus we don't even know about, that could be                present and transmitted if the cells are grown on animal feeder                layer, that wouldn't be a risk if you had, you know, the absence                of a feeder layer or a human feeder layer?  And so wouldn't                it be nice if you could avoid that risk?                   DR. McCLELLAN:   It's certainly possible that there                are completely unknown, you know, animal viruses that could potentially                be transmitted to humans.                  We just haven't ever seen them observed, and that's why                an important part of our guidances here is followup on the patients                who are involved in these studies, so that as we learn more over                time we'll be able to identify any problems that might subsequently                emerge in the patients that have been brave enough to participate                in these early studies, and to make sure that we can let the patients                know if there is new technology that becomes available that ought                to influence their subsequent treatment.                 But there are — you know, those kinds of hypotheticals exist in                each and every one of these many complicated aspects of stem cell                therapy.  There are the potential for human cells to harbor completely                unknown illnesses that might also be transmitted.                 It might even be easier to transmit to humans than in animals,                and even for cells that are harvested and used in treatment without                the use of any kind of feeder layers.  There are still a host of                other issues, as you identified, that could present important safety                concerns.                 We do have to make our regulatory decisions and allow studies                to go forward under uncertainty.  You know, these issues are never                going to be fully resolved, and I think that the best job we can                do is try to make sure we're apprised of all of the latest science,                all of the, you know, concerns that might impact on potential risks                and benefits for patients involved in the studies, and then do as                careful of a job as possible in making sure that the best and latest                knowledge is applied as we move forward in this important area of                emerging science.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Permit me one very quick question.                 You've indicated how your experience with xenotransplantation                in other areas gives you some confidence that you might not have                received with this aspect of it.                  Is there any precedent and experience for dealing with the specific                kind of risk of teratoma or tumors that are associated with — well,                possibly it could be associated with, say, residual, undifferentiated                stem cells that might accompany a population that have been differentiated?                                DR. McCLELLAN:   That's certainly something that we're                monitoring for here.  And some of the — and in many of the earlier                human stem cell — I mean, human cellular studies that — or cellular                studies more generally, they were differentiated cells involved.                               And so it raised different kinds of issues than a pluripotent                or an undifferentiated stem cell might.  It's definitely something                that's on people's minds, and we're watching carefully.                 We don't know of any specific evidence of important problems                there yet that we haven't accounted for, but we are monitoring                it carefully.                  I think that's one reason we pay so much attention in these                protocols to understanding and tracking the exact conditions under                which the cells were derived, because that can potentially have                an impact on how they might differentiate and act in — after implantation                subsequently.  It's just an area where we have to watch closely,                because it's not very well understood.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, Dr. McClellan, thank you very much                for being with us, for your presentation, and for your very good                work.                   DR.

GX242-07-12396423	"Vol. 56, No. 16  August 5, 1996  Dengue Fever Dengue was endemic in parts of the United States, including Texas, until 1945, when improved sanitation and the use of pesticides dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease. Only sporadic, travel-related dengue cases were reported through 1979, but outbreaks with some indigenous transmission occurred in 1980 and 1986.1,2 Indigenous cases were again reported, from Hidalgo and Cameron Counties, in 1995. Understandably, interest in dengue is once again high. The first section of this report is a brief retrospective of dengue's history, characteristics, and current status in this hemisphere. The following section contains Texas morbidity and mortality data for 1995.  Dengue Retrospective Among the newly emergent and re-emergent diseases in the Western Hemisphere is dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease characterized by high fever, headache, myalgias, and a maculopapular rash. There are four virus serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN4, all of which are transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and possibly by Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Both species lay their eggs in open containers of water. Due in part to the disappearance of mosquito eradication programs, dengue has once again swept Latin America and now threatens the US. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 274,922 cases of dengue and 7,715 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), with 104 deaths, occurred in the Americas in 1995.3 In response to the current situation, PAHO has drafted an emergency action plan, focusing on education of at-risk populations, international cooperation in surveillance, and reactivation of vector control programs.  word derives from the Swahili description of the disease: ki denga pepo, meaning ""cramplike seizure caused by an evil spirit.""5 Outbreaks widely affected Texas residents during every decade from 1885 to 1941, primarily due to the rapid expansion of the shipping industry.6 Ships transported infected mosquitoes and people to unaffected areas, leading to pandemics of dengue in the western hemisphere as early as 1827 and every 20 or 30 years for the rest of the century. As commercial ports in Texas flourished, the disease was imported along with more desirable cargo into Galveston, Brownsville, and Houston, often reaching as far inland as Austin. In the late 1800s, the diagnosis of dengue was still confusing; some practitioners considered it to be a form of yellow fever. Doctors earned their patients' ire by, ""charging them two yellow fever bills, whilst contending that the disease attacks but once.""7 Yellow fever was not the only source of confusion in diagnosis. Throughout the 19th century arthritic symptoms were associated with what was then called dengue. In hindsight, this situation Continued F  A Brief Stateside History of Dengue Nearly two centuries ago Benjamin Rush, a doctor in Philadelphia, wrote what may have been the first clinical report of dengue. Describing an epidemic that occurred in Philadelphia in 1789, he called the illness ""breakbone fever.""4 During a West Indies epidemic 30 years later, the word dengue was coined to describe the symptoms outlined by Rush. This  Also in this issue: A Pot of Shigella at Rainbow's End Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area Perspectives in Public Health Conference Conference Registration Form   Page 2  August 5, 1996  DPN  suggests that an agent other than dengue was at work. Until the laboratory isolation of the etiologic agent itself, practitioners had to rely on clinical findings to define these and other illnesses easily mistaken for dengue (eg, typhus, rubella, and measles). By the close of the century, healthcare providers in Texas began to realize that textbook descriptions of dengue did not correspond to the disease as it appeared in this state.6 By 1906 dengue had been well defined clinically, and T. L. Bancroft had shown the etiologic agent to be an ultramicroscopic organism transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.5 He conducted his experiments using human subjects. Bancroft's discovery is particularly interesting in light of the fact that the dengue virus was not isolated in the laboratory for another 40 years. In 1922 an epidemic of enormous proportions--one million people are estimated to have been affected--began in Galveston and spread as far as Georgia.8 Although the initial cases were most likely imported, the majority of subsequent cases were locally acquired. The mosquitoes that year had bred in unprecedented proportions, and no eradication efforts had been made. According to a clinical report of the Galveston outbreak, Unscreened houses of the poorer classes, situated near or around the dumping grounds, swarmed with these mosquitoes. They gained entrance to practically all screened houses, invaded automobiles, and countless numbers were present in the grass of overgrown gutters and lawns. The dumping grounds mentioned were swamps used as a garbage dump by the citizens. Many observations of the incubation period were made during this time, increasing knowledge of the disease. Diagnosis in 1922 was based on signs still used today: sudden onset, fever, headache, body aches, and rash.  Outbreaks also occurred in Texas in 1934 and 1941. As was likely during antecedent outbreaks, the virus was probably imported from the Caribbean. The subsequent decline in endemic cases resulted from improved sanitation in the US and from Ae. aegypti eradication programs initiated by PAHO in 1947.9 By 1962 the mosquito was believed to be confined to a few relatively small areas, which included parts of the US, the coasts of Mexico, all of Colombia, and northern Argentina. Ten years later, due to waning interest and political unrest, almost all programs had been discontinued. Today the range of Ae. aegypti includes most of Central and South America, Mexico, and the Southeastern United States (including Texas). (See Figure 1.) Ae. albopictus is another mosquito considered to be a dengue vector. Introduced into the Americas by 1985, probably in tires shipped from Asia, this vector has since spread. It can be found throughout the eastern two-thirds of Texas.10  Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever In 1954 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), which had been frequently described but was still unnamed, appeared in the Philippines. Since then, DHF has emerged as a deadly and epidemic problem in the Americas and Asia.11 DHF is characterized by high fever, like classic dengue, but has more serious complications: hemorrhagic phenomena, pain, and circulatory failure. Easy bruising, fine petechiae, epistaxis, and mild gastrointestinal bleeding are, in decreasing order of frequency, DHF symptoms caused by increased capillary permeability. The fatality rate for DHF is about 5% in most countries. One third of DHF cases progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a short (12 to 24 hour) stage of illness that may lead to widely disseminated hemorrhage and coma. The case-fatality rate for untreated DSS is 20%. Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 3  Figure 1. Distribution of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes: North and South America, 1970 and 1995 1970 1990  Shaded areas show large mosquito populations.  The risk of developing DHF is 100 times greater with a second heterotypical infection.9 Although the precise mechanisms affecting the development of DHF are not fully understood, the second infection is thought to trigger an immunopathologic process involving non-neutralizing antibodies from the previous infection.  spread of dengue, also imply that greater efforts should be made to educate practitioners in the diagnosis and control of dengue, especially in high risk areas. In addition, PAHO recommends mosquito surveillance, evaluation of vector control programs, and development of public education programs.9 Education programs must include basic information about the breeding habits of mosquitoes and the necessity for community efforts in removing breeding containers such as aluminum cans, buckets, and used tires from areas of human habitation. According to PAHO, dengue is ""basically a problem of domestic sanitation.""9 The community, therefore, holds the key to the control of mosquitoes, and community efforts determine whether control programs succeed or fail. Prepared by Greg Brown, Student Intern, Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Surveillance Division  The Current Situation DEN -2, -1, and -4 have spread, in that order, throughout Latin America after having vanished almost completely during the mosquito eradication programs of the 1950s and 1960s. DEN-3 was introduced to the Americas recently and is spreading,12 bringing with it an increased incidence of both DHF and DSS. A 1980 study found that there was a median of 40 days between the onset of dengue and the diagnosis of disease, suggesting the need for earlier diagnosis of dengue infection and implementation of active surveillance systems.1 These findings, combined with the rapid  Continued F   Page 4 References  August 5, 1996  DPN  TDH was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa....

The proximity of these outbreaks and the fact that the mosquito species that transmit dengue are commonly found in the eastern two-thirds of the state, increased the likelihood of both imported and autochthonous cases occurring in Texas. Therefore, TDH immediately implemented an educational campaign that stressed prevention and an active surveillance system to monitor the situation. (See DPN Vol. 55, Nos. 15 and 21 and Vol. 56, No.1) TDH reported 29 cases of dengue in 1995: 9 from Hidalgo County, 5 from Harris County, 4 from Cameron County, 4 from Dallas County, 2 from Fort Bend County, and 1 each from Bell, Collin, Hays, Tarrant, and Waller Counties. Dengue virus was isolated from 3 patients. The first isolate, from a patient residing in Hidalgo County, was DEN-2; the second, from a patient in Cameron County, was DEN-4; and the third, from a Dallas resident, was DEN-3. Neither the patient with DEN-2 nor the patient with DEN-4 had a travel history. Four cases from Hidalgo County and 3 from Cameron County were locally acquired. The remaining 22 patients had travel histories. Twelve persons had been to Mexico. The others had been to the Caribbean (4), El Salvador (2), Honduras (2), or Guatemala (1), areas where dengue was epidemic. The patient with DEN-3 drove through Mexico and Guatemala to El Salvador. Two patients had onset of illness in March, 2 in July, 5 in August, 9 in September, 7 in October, 2 in November, and 2 in December. Symptoms included fever (29 patients), arthralgias/bone pain (26), headache (24), chills (21), myalgias (18), anorexia (18), severe malaise (17), rash (16), lumbosacral pain (12), nausea/ vomiting (12), dysgeusia (11), retro-orbital pain (9), dysesthesia (7), respiratory symptoms (7), petechiae, purpura, or epistaxis (3), and lymphadenopathy (4).  Dengue in Texas: 1995 On August 25, 1995, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) was notified of an ongoing dengue fever outbreak in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, approximately 10 miles from McAllen, Texas. By the end of December, 2,361 cases were reported. An additional 430 cases of dengue were reported from  Continued F   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 5  People can eliminate dengue vector breeding sites by removing, emptying, or covering containers of water. Therefore, health officials in Mexico and Texas are attempting to avert an outbreak in 1996 through public health education campaigns. In May bilingual pamphlets, Prevent Dengue by Stopping the Mosquito Life Cycle, were distributed to children attending public schools in South Texas. In addition, a slide presentation detailing the epidemiology of dengue will soon be available through TDH regional offices and the TDH film library. Since most dengue cases occur from August through December, the 1996 season is imminent. Healthcare workers should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of all patients who have symptoms similar to those of dengue, particularly u u  when they also have a history of recent travel to areas associated with risk. The TDH Laboratory performs viral isolation and serologic tests. Whole blood, serum, or CSF (collected within 5 days of onset) should be placed on dry ice and shipped overnight for viral isolation. Single serum specimens may be submitted at ambient temperature for antibody detection. Convalescent sera (collected 10 to 14 days after the acute specimen was drawn) may be required to confirm recent infection. Send specimens to Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Laboratories, 1100 West 49th Street, Austin, Texas 78756.

The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States and at least 2 other countries. The Rainbow Gathering in Missouri this year is the second to be associated with a shigella outbreak. Of approximately 12,000 persons who attended the gathering held in North Carolina, July 1987, an estimated 1,200 became ill with shigella. The first S.sonnei case was culture confirmed on July 8. As of July 26, the Missouri Public Health Laboratory (MPHL) had confirmed 21 cases, with additional suspected cases still under investigation. The organism is resistant to ampicillin, piperacillin, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The home residences of these 21 case-patients are as follows: Missouri (3); California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, and Oregon (2 each); Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Tennessee (1 each); and Germany (1). The standard treatment protocol being used at this time is ciprofloxacin, 500 mg, twice a day for 3 days (for a total of 6 doses). Of the estimated 500 Rainbow Gathering participants who remain, 30%40% are reportedly ill. As of July 26, 2 giardia cases also have been confirmed. (One of the giardia cases was in an individual who also had culture-confirmed S. sonnei). The MDH investigation and laboratory testing is still in progress. Self-described as a ""disorganization of nonmembers,"" the Rainbow Family has gathered on public land in different locations every year since July 4, 1972. For the week-long festival, participants refuse to sign permits, citing their First Amendment right to assemble peaceably. Organizers began setting up camp in Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest on June 12. Participants camped in the forest and ate communally. Drinking water was obtained from nearby springs and creeks that were also used for bathing. Continued F  The gathering was attended by 15,500 people from all over the United States ....   Page 6  August 5, 1996  DPN  In light of health problems connected with previous Rainbow Gatherings, the large number of participants at this event, and their nonstandard approach to public hygiene, MDH initiated the following control measures. Active surveillance was begun at local hospitals on June 23, hospital staff were asked to report all health conditions treated in Rainbow Family members, and laboratory testing was included in evaluation of diarrheal cases.  S. sonnei infection causes an acute diarrheal disease that often lasts only 1 to 3 days; many individuals do not seek medical care for this type of illness. When they do, many are treated empirically, and stool cultures are not obtained. Because a large number of people from all over the US and 2 other countries attended the Rainbow Gathering in Missouri last month, and because the S. sonnei strain responsible for this outbreak is multidrug resistant--TDH recommends that physicians obtain stool specimens from patients with diarrheal illness. Cases possibly associated with the Missouri outbreak should be reported by calling (800) 252-8239. All other shigella cases should be reported to the local health authority by calling the statewide number, (800) 705-8868.  Shigella in Texas S. sonnei accounted for 1,555 (52%) of the 3,017 shigella cases reported in Texas in 1995. Texas law requires that shigellosis be reported to the Texas Department of Health on a weekly basis. For a variety of reasons, however, many S. sonnei cases probably are not reported.  Note: As of August 1, 1996, cryptosporidium infections and ehrlichiosis were added to the list of reportable diseases. In addition TDH has limited the reporting of invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections to H. influenzae type b infections only.  Measles Outbreak in Harris County Area As of July 26, 1996, investigation continues of a measles outbreak that began in Harris County; 1 case has also been confirmed in Liberty County. Rash onset for the first culture-confirmed case was May 9, and for the most recent case was July 22. The clinical case definition of measles is as follows: generalized rash lasting 3 or more days PLUS temperature of 101F or higher PLUS cough or coryza or conjunctivitis. The rash usually breaks out on the face and spreads to the chest, arms, and legs. To date, 16 cases have been confirmed. Of the 16 case-patients, 9 were children 7 to 9 years of age, 1 was 13 years old, and 6 were younger than 4 years of age. Seven case-patients had received 1 dose of measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two boys, brothers 8 and 9 years of age, were unvaccinated due to invalid contraindications. An additional 5 patients, aged 9 to 18 months were also unvaccinated. Two of these patients were below the minimum age for MMR. TDH recommends that infants 6 to 11 months of age residing in the Harris County area be vaccinated with the single-antigen measles vaccine, if available. If not, MMR may be given. Children aged 1 to 4 years should have 1 dose (preferably 2) of MMR vaccine. Persons in other areas of the state should follow TDH standard recommendations: a first dose of MMR at 12 months of age and a second dose at 4 years of age. All persons 4 years of age or older born on or after January 1, 1957 should have at least 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine, preferably 2 doses of MMR. Report all suspected cases of measles IMMEDIATELY by calling (800) 252-9152.  It takes 2 doses of measles vaccine to assure protection against measles.   DPN  August 5, 1996  Page 7  Perspectives in Public Health: Texas Department of Health (TDH) Quarterly CME Conference On September 20, 1996, from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) will present its Perspectives in Public Health: TDH Quarterly CME Conference.

GX254-70-10823155	"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly R eport Weekly February 21, 2003 / Vol. 52 / No. 7  Fatal Degenerative Neurologic Illnesses in Men Who Participated in Wild Game Feasts -- Wisconsin, 2002 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal neurologic disorder in humans. CJD is one of a group of conditions known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, that are believed to be caused by abnormally configured, host-encoded prion proteins that accumulate in the central ner vous tissue (1). CJD has an annual incidence of approximately 1 case per million population in the United States (1) and occurs in three forms: sporadic, genetically determined, and acquired by infection. In the latter form, the incubation period is measured typically in years. Recent evidence that prion infection can cross the species barrier between humans and cattle has raised increasing public health concerns about the possible transmission to humans of a TSE among deer and elk known as chronic wasting disease (CWD) (2). During 19931999, three men who participated in wild game feasts in northern Wisconsin died of degenerative neurologic illnesses. This report documents the investigation of these deaths, which was initiated in August 2002 and which confirmed the death of only one person from CJD. Although no association between CWD and CJD was found, continued surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk for CWD transmission to humans. A repeat EEG showed bifrontal intermittent, short-interval, periodic sharp waves, suggesting a progressive encephalopathy; a diagnosis of CJD was suspected. The man died later that month; neuropathologic examination of brain tissue during autopsy indicated subacute spongiform encephalopathy, compatible with CJD. The man was a lifelong hunter who ate venison frequently. He hunted primarily in northern Wisconsin but also at least once in Montana. He hosted wild game feasts at his cabin in northern Wisconsin from 1976 until shortly before his death. Fixed brain tissue obtained during the autopsy was sent for analysis to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) and reexamined at the institution where the autopsy was conducted. Histopathologic examination did not substantiate the diagnosis of prion disease. In addition, 27 brain tissue sections wer e negative for prions by immunostaining despite positive antibody reactions against other proteins (controls), which indicated that other epitopes in the tissue samples were preserved. Case 2. In May 1999, a Minnesota man aged 55 years with no previous history of a neurologic disease sought evaluation and treatment following a 3-month history of progressive difficulty in writing and unsteadiness of gait. A computerized INSIDE  Case Reports Case 1. In December 1992, a Wisconsin man aged 66 years with a history of seizures since 1969 sought treatment for recurring seizures, increasing forgetfulness, and worsening hand tremors. Electroencephalographic (EEG) examination demonstrated focal epileptiform activity and nonspecific diffuse abnormalities, but no specific diagnosis was made. In February 1993, he was hospitalized for increasing confusion, ataxia, and movement tremors of his extremities. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) demonstrated mild, nonspecific enhancement along the inferior parasagittal occipital lobe. 128 131 Atrial Fibrillation as a Contributing Cause of Death and Medicare Hospitalization -- United States, 1999 Potential Exposures to Airborne and Settled Surface Dust in Residential Areas of Lower Manhattan Following the Collapse of the World Trade Center -- New York City, November 4December 11, 2001 Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events Among Civilians -- United States, January 24February 18, 2003 Notice to Readers  136 136  department of health and human services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   126  MMWR  February 21, 2003  The MMWR series of publications is published by the Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Atlanta, GA 30333.

In June 1999, he was hospitalized following onset of dementia, speech abnormalities, and myoclonic jerking. An EEG indicated left-hemispheric periodic sharp waves and moderate generalized background slowing; CJD was diagnosed clinically. In July 1999, following worsening symptoms and development of right upper extremity dystonia, the patient died. Neuropathologic evaluation of brain tissue during autopsy demonstrated widespread subcortical spongiform lesions, consistent with CJD. The man was not a hunter but had a history of eating venison. He made an estimated 12 visits to the cabin where the wild game feasts were held, but he participated in only one feast during the mid-1980s. Sections of fixed and frozen brain tissue obtained during autopsy were analyzed at NPDPSC, and prion disease was confirmed by immunohistochemical and Western blot testing. The Western blot characteristics and prion disease phenotype in this patient were consistent with the most common form of sporadic CJD, classified as M/M (M/V) 1 (3). Subsequent genetic typing confirmed the presence of methionine homozygosity (M/M) at codon 129 of the patient's prion protein gene. Case 3. In June 1992, a Wisconsin man aged 65 years sought t reatment for progressive slowing of speech, worsening memory, and personality changes. By January 1993, his speech was reduced to one-word utterances. Neurologic examination showed a flat affect, decreased reflexes, and apraxia. A CT head scan showed mild atrophy, and an EEG was normal. Pick's disease was diagnosed. By May, he was unable to perform any daily living activities; he died in August 1993. Neuropathologic evaluation of brain tissue during autopsy showed symmetrical frontal lobe cerebral cortical atrophy and mild temporal lobe atrophy. No Pick's bodies or spongiform lesions were observed. The man had a history of eating venison and participated regularly in wild game feasts held at the cabin owned by patient 1. He was a lifelong hunter and hunted mostly in Wisconsin but also in Wyoming and British Columbia. No game was brought to the wild game feasts from his hunting trips outside of Wisconsin. Examination of fixed brain tissue sent to NPDPSC demonstrated no lesions indicative of CJD, and immunohistochemical testing with antibody to the prion protein did not demonstrate the granular deposits seen in prion diseases.  Epidemiologic Investigation Wild game feasts consisting of elk, deer, antelope, and other game that occurred at a cabin in northern Wisconsin owned by patient 1 began in 1976 and continued through 2002.   Vol. 52 / No. 7  MMWR  127  These feasts typically involved 1015 participants and usually occurred on weekends before or during hunting seasons in the fall and occasionally in the spring. Wild game brought to these feasts usually were harvested in Wisconsin, but three men who attended these feasts reported hunting in the western United States and bringing game back to Wisconsin. These activities took place in Colorado (near the towns of Cortez, Trinidad, Collbran, Durango, and Meeker), Wyoming (near the towns of Gilette and Cody), and Montana (near the town of Malta). CWD was not known to be endemic in these areas at the time that these hunting activities took place. Information was obtained for 45 (85%) of 53 persons who were identified as possibly participating in the wild game feasts; all were male. Information was obtained by direct inter view or from family members of decedents. Of the 45 persons, for whom information was obtained, 34 were reported to have attended wild game feasts. Seven of the 34 feast attendees were deceased, including the three patients. None of the four other decedents had a cause of death attributed to or associated with a degenerative neurologic disorder. None of the living participants had any signs or symptoms consistent with a degenerative neurologic disorder.

L Schonberger, MD, R Maddox, MPH, E Belay, MD, Div of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases; V Hsu, MD, EIS Officer, CDC.  Editorial Note: CWD was first described in the United States in the 1960s and classified as a TSE in 1978. Previously localized to a contiguous endemic area in northeastern Colorado and southeast Wyoming, since 2000, CWD has been found in free-ranging deer or elk in Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and outside the previously known endemic areas of Colorado and Wyoming. CWD has been identified also in captive deer or elk in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin (4). Because a variant form of CJD, with specific neuropathologic and molecular characteristics that distinguish it from sporadic CJD, has been associated with eating cattle products infected with a prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (5), concern has been raised about the possibility that the prion associated with CWD might be transmitted to humans in a similar way. In this investigation, because only one of the three cases in Wisconsin had neuropathologic confirmation of a prion disease, no association could be made between case participation in the wild game feasts and the development of CJD. Although patient 2 had confirmed CJD, he was unlikely to  have eaten CWD-infected venison at these feasts because venison and other game from outside Wisconsin that was served at these feasts did not originate from known CWD-endemic areas, and the man participated in the feasts only once. In addition, the prion disease in this case was consistent with the most common form of sporadic CJD, without apparent unusual neuropathologic or molecular characteristics that might occur if the prion related to CWD had been responsible for the disease. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, not all members participating in wild game feasts could be identified, and not all persons listed as participating could be contacted for interviews. Second, interviews that were conducted required recall of events that occurred up to 25 years ago, limiting the detail or accuracy of events. However, the similar responses obtained from different sources support the accuracy of the investigation findings. A previous investigation of unusually young CJD patients in whom the transmission of CWD was suspected also did not provide convincing evidence for a causal relationship between CWD and CJD (2). However, limited epidemiologic investigations cannot rule out the possibility that CWD might play a role in causing human illness. Ongoing surveillance of CJD, particularly in states with CWD, is important to assess the risk, if any, for CWD transmission to humans. Because the confirmation of CJD and the detection of a new prion disease require neuropathologic study of brain tissue, physicians are encouraged to contact NPDPSC (http:// www.cjdsurveillance.com; telephone, 216-368-0587) to confirm diagnoses of CJD and to distinguish its various subtypes. Because of the known severity of TSEs in humans and the possibility that the CWD prion can affect humans, animals with evidence of CWD should be excluded from the human food or animal feed chains. Hunters and wild venison consumers should follow precautionar y guidelines available from the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (http://datcp.state.wi.us/core/consumerinfo) to prevent potential exposures to the CWD agent.

One of the major risk factors for stroke is atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac disorder characterized by cardiac arrhythmia and the absence of coordinated contractions, which increases the risk for blood stasis, clot formation, and embolic stroke. AF affects approximately 2.2 million adults in the United States (1,2) and is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance observed in clinical practice (3). The rate of AF increases with age, from <1% among persons aged <60 years to approximately 10% among persons aged >80 years (4). The frequency with which AF is reported on death certificates as a contributing cause of death has increased since 1980 (5). To assess the burden of AF-related deaths and hospitalizations among U.S. residents, CDC analyzed national and state multiple-cause mortality statistics and Medicare hospital claims for persons with AF in 1999 (the latest year for which data were available) for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The findings indicate that AF as a contributing cause of death and hospitalization affects primarily persons aged >75 years and that death and hospitalization rates var y by state. Public and medical education are needed to prevent and reduce AF-related disability and death. National and state multiple-cause mortality statistics were obtained from death certificates in state vital statistics offices and compiled by CDC. AF-related deaths are those for which the contributing cause of death* (any one of the 20 possible conditions listed on the death certificate) listed by a physician or a coroner is classified as code I48 according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD10). Among decedents who had AF, the proportion of those who had an underlying cause of death listed as AF (ICD-10 I48), coronary heart disease (ICD-10 I20I25), or stroke (ICD-10 I60I69) also was assessed. Demographic data (age, sex, and race/ethnicity) on death certificates were reported by funeral directors or provided by family members of the decedent. The denominators for death rates were obtained from 1999 census records and included only U.S. residents. Medicare (Part A) hospital claims and enrollment records from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. * Contributing cause of death was defined as the subsequent diagnosis considered with the cause of death, and underlying cause of death was defined as the primary diagnosis associated with the death.  AF-related hospitalizations among Medicare enrollees aged >65 y ears w e r e classified as code 427.3 accor ding to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) as one of six diagnoses on the hospital claims during 1999. The denominators for hospitalization rates were obtained from Medicare enrollment records and included enrollees aged >65 years who were entitled to Medicare Part A benefits on July 1, 1999 (excluding 15.7% of members with coverage from health maintenance organizations). Among persons hospitalized with AF, the proportion of those who had a primary hospital diagnosis of AF (ICD-9 427.3), coronar y heart disease (ICD-9 410414, 429.2), or stroke (ICD-9 430434, 436438) also was assessed. AF-related death rates for groups defined by age, sex, race/ ethnicity, and state were determined by dividing the number of deaths by the population at risk (denominator) in each group. Rates of hospitalizations among Medicare enrollees aged >65 years with AF for each group were determined by dividing the number of hospitalizations by the population at risk (denominator) in the group. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) and hospitalization rates (per 1,000 Medicare enrollees) were calculated by using the 2000 U.S. standard population (6). In 1999, a total of 66,875 deaths with AF as a contributing cause occurred, resulting in an age-adjusted death rate of 24.7 per 100,000 population. Of these deaths, 56,138 (84.0%) were among persons aged >75 years. The greatest proportion of these AF-related deaths occurred among persons aged >85 years (47.4%), followed by those aged 7584 years (36.6%), aged 6574 years (12.3%), and aged <65 years (3.7%). Agespecific death rates increased for successive age groups (Table 1). Age-adjusted death rates for AF were highest among whites (25.7) and blacks (16.4) and higher for men (34.7) than women (22.8). In 1999, for all decedents who had AF, the most common underlying causes of death were coronary heart disease (28.0%), AF (12.4%), and stroke (10.8%). In 1999, a total of 1,765,304 hospitalizations (137.1 per 1,000 Medicare enrollees) were reported among persons with AF in the Medicare population (Table 1). Rates increased among successive age groups. The rate of hospitalization among persons with AF was higher among whites (142.7) than among blacks (100.4). Although 55.7% of these hospitalizations were among women, men (162.9) had a higher rate of AF-related hospitalization than women (121.2). The most common diseases listed as the primary diagnosis for persons hospitalized with AF we re congestiv e hear t failure (11.8%), followed by AF (10.9%), coronar y heart disease (9.9%), and stroke (4.9%).   rec  om  men  da  t ion: n 1 : something, such as a course of action, that is recommended; see also MMWR.

Editorial Note: The findings in this report confirm that AF is a contributing cause of death among older persons, particularly those aged >75 years, and that state-specific AF-related death rates vary. These findings are consistent with other trends of AF-related deaths (5). Patterns in the rate of AF-related hospitalization among Medicare enrollees are similar to those for death rates.

A cohort study of hospitalized Medicare patients indicated that medical costs were greater for patients with AF than for those without AF (7). In addition, effective therapies for AF reduced the risk for stroke by >70%. Patients who have coronar y heart disease, hypertensive disease, or stroke diagnosed and who live longer might be at risk for AF if effective therapy is not maintained ( 8 ). Serious complications among patients with uncontrolled AF also can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thrombotic stroke. Initial treatment of AF should be directed at controlling the ventricular rate with a calcium channel blocker, betablocker, or digitalis (3). Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in AF. Effective therapies in preventing stroke and cardiovascular complications include anticoagulation, heart rate control, conv ersion of AF to normal heart rhythm, and catheter-based and surgical interventions (3). Educating the public to recognize the signs of cardiac arrhythmia can help identify persons with AF. Persons can identify an irregular heartbeat by monitoring their wrist pulse for 1 minute. The irregularity of these beats is detected and the next beat cannot be predicted. Persons who identify the signs of cardiac arrhythmia should seek medical care to determine the presence of AF or other hear t disorders. The Research Center for Stroke and Heart Disease (http://www. strokeheart.org), has initiated the educational campaign, ""Take Your Pulse For Life."" This initiative recommends that persons, particularly those aged >55 years, monitor their pulse for 1 minute the first day of every month. Assessing whether a patient has AF can be easy and inexpensive through using electrocardiography (ECG) ( 3); the availability of more advanced diagnostic tools, such as ECG monitoring, might contribute to AF diagnosis in persons suspected to have cardiac arrhythmia. Delay in diagnosis occurs when the rhythm has not been documented specifically and additional monitoring is necessary (3). All persons should know how to take a pulse for themselves or their family members. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, data are subject to misclassification of race/ ethnicity both in the population census and on death certificates, possibly resulting in overreporting among blacks and whites and underreporting among other racial/ethnic groups (9). Second, it was not possible to determine the accuracy of physician or administrative reporting, the validity of the ICD codes, or multiple hospitalizations on Medicare hospital claims. Because AF is one of the major treatable risk factors for stroke, prevention of AF through public and medical education for early identification and appropriate treatment should  become an important focus of public health efforts to reduce stroke-related deaths and disability. Prevention efforts should include broad-based public health efforts to increase public awareness of AF and to foster timely and appropriate diagnostic evaluation and effective treatment from health-care providers.

Potential Exposures to Airborne and Settled Surface Dust in Residential Areas of Lower Manhattan Following the Collapse of the World Trade Center -- New York City, November 4 December 11, 2001 Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which destroyed the World Trade Center (WTC) in lower Manhattan, the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registr y (ATSDR), with assistance from the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Corps   132  MMWR  February 21, 2003  Readiness Force* and the WTC Environmental Assessment Working Group, assessed the composition of outdoor and indoor settled surface and airborne dust in residential areas around the WTC and in comparison areas. This report summarizes the results of the investigation, which found 1) similar levels of airborne total fibers in lower and in upper Manhattan, 2) greater percentage levels of synthetic vitreous fibers (SVF) and mineral components of concrete and building wallboard in settled dust of residential areas in lower Manhattan than in upper Manhattan, and 3) low levels of asbestos in some settled surface dust in lower Manhattan residential areas (1). Based in part on the results of this investigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is cleaning and sampling residential areas as requested by lower Manhattan residents. In addition, to assess any short- or longterm health effects of smoke, dust, and airborne substances around the WTC site, DOHMH and ATSDR are developing a registry that will track the health of persons who were most highly exposed to these materials. During November 4December 11, 2001, air and settled surface dust samples were collected in and around 30 residential buildings within three concentric circles surrounding the WTC site in lower Manhattan, including 59 residential units (2 ). In addition, five residential units in four buildings located north of 59th Street (approximately 5 miles northeast of the WTC site) were sampled for purposes of comparison. Attention was focused on building material constituents 1) that have irritant properties (e.g., SVF, including fiberglass and gypsum) or might have negative long-term health effects (e.g., crystalline silica and asbestos) and 2) that were reasonably presumed to be either in the initial WTC collapse dust cloud or in dust generated by subsequent rescue and recovery activities at the WTC site. All samples collected during the investigation were analyzed for the presence of asbestos, SVF, crystalline mineral components of concrete (e.g., silica, calcite, and portlandite), and crystalline mineral components of building wallboard (e.g., gypsum, mica, and halite). At each sampling location, time-weighted air sampling was conducted for three or four particulate matter (PM) fractions (i.e., PM 100 microns, 10 microns, 4 microns, and 2.5 microns) (35). Each PM fraction was analyzed for crystalline minerals by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (6). * A cadre of PHS Commissioned Corps officers who can be mobilized during disaster, strife, or other public health emergencies and in response to domestic or international requests.  A group formed on September 15, 2001, that comprises representatives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Labor, and New York State and NYC government and private organizations to coordinate public health and occupational sampling and data review among the three federal agencies in support of state and city health departments.  The XRD analysis for crystalline minerals was semiquantitative (i.e., estimated). Air samples for fibers were analyzed first by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) (5). If the concentration of total fibers was higher than the maximum concentration of fibers found in the comparison homes (0.003 fibers per cubic centimeter of air [f/cc]), the sample was re-analyzed for asbestos fibers by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (5). In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to look for SVF was used for PCM fiber counts >0.003 f/cc if the settled surface dust sample from that area contained SVF. Settled surface dust samples also were taken at each sampling location and analyzed for crystalline minerals and fibers (Figure). Fiber analysis of settled dust samples for asbestos and SVF was conducted by using polarized light microscopy (PLM) (7). If asbestos levels were below the detection limit (i.e., <1%), samples were re-analyzed by using TEM (7). The dust samples also were analyzed for crystalline mineral content by using XRD.  Air Sampling Results For 111 (94.9%) of the 117 air samples, the concentrations of fibers found in lower Manhattan residential areas were similar to the concentration of fibers found in comparison areas (<0.003 f/cc). The six lower Manhattan areas that had elevated total fiber counts were re-examined by TEM and SEM to determine the types of fibers; the results indicated that neither asbestos nor SVF (e.g., fiberglass) contributed to the elevated total fiber counts. Air sampling results for minerals detected quartz and other building material constituents in lower Manhattan. No other forms of crystalline silica were detected in any air samples except for a one-time detection of cristobalite (15 micrograms per cubic meter [g/m3]). The estimated concentrations of these minerals in air were low. In some locations, mineral com  Estimated.  FIGURE.

Gypsum was the only mineral detected in the comparison building air samples (ND5 g/m3). No other minerals tested (i.e., quartz, calcite, portlandite, mica, and halite) were detected in comparison building air samples.

Settled Surface Dust Results In lower Manhattan, asbestos and SVF were found in some indoor settled dust samples from residential units and common areas (Table 1). No asbestos or SVF was detected in the comparison area dust samples. Quartz, calcite, portlandite, and gypsum comprised a higher percentage of the dust in 29 samples from buildings in lower Manhattan compared with eight samples from comparison area buildings (Table 2). Only two (2.1%) of the 97 dust samples collected provided enough bulk material for pH analysis. The samples, which were collected from two outdoor locations in lower Manhattan, had pH values of 8.6 and 9.8, respectively.  Editorial Note: Exposure to substantial amounts of SVF, mineral components of concrete, and mineral components of building wallboard might cause skin rashes, eye irritation, and upper respirator y irritation, all of which were reported more frequently than expected seasonal rates by community members and first responders after the collapse of the WTC towers (810). If the reported irritant effects were associated with WTC-related materials, these effects would subside once exposure to SVF, mineral components of concrete, and mineral components of building wallboard ceased. Persons with pre-existing heart or lung diseases (e.g., asthma) or a previous history of occupational exposure to these materials might be more sensitive to their irritant effects. Settled surface dust might become airborne if disturbed, potentially causing exposures to occur through inhalation. Sev eral worst-case assumptions were made to assess the potential long-term public health risks for inhaling airborne asbestos and quartz. These assumptions included 1) that no  TABLE 1.

Under these worst-case conditions, prolonged exposure (i.e., decades) to airborne asbestos and quartz might increase the long-term risk for persons developing lung cancer and other adverse lung health effects (approximately one additional case per 10,000 persons exposed). However, persons who clean their residences frequently as recommended (1) or who participate in the EPA cleaning and sampling program are unlikely to be exposed to worst-case conditions.  The findings of this investigation are subject to at least two limitations. First, the results do not necessarily reflect conditions found in other buildings, the time period immediately after the collapse, or the time period after December 12, when the sampling was completed. Second, a limited number of samples were obtained from comparison areas to determine NYC background levels of asbestos, SVF, mineral components of concrete, and mineral components of building wallboard. The comparison area results might not reflect NYC background levels.   Vol. 52 / No. 7  MMWR  135  Following the investigation, DOHMH and ATSDR made three recommendations (1). First, because more asbestos, SVF, mineral components of concrete and building wallboard were found in settled surface dust in lower Manhattan residential areas than in comparison residential areas, residents of lower Manhattan were advised to continue cleaning frequently with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter vacuums and damp cloths/mops to reduce the potential for exposure. Second, to ensure the effectiveness of the recommended cleaning, DOHMH and AT SDR r ecommended additional monitoring of residential areas in lower Manhattan and an investigation to define background levels specific to NYC for asbestos, SVF, mineral components of concrete, and mineral components of building wallboard. EPA is implementing this recommendation and conducting this investigation. Finally, lower Manhattan residents concerned about possible WTCrelated dust in their residential areas were advised to request cleaning and testing from EPA no later than December 31, 2002. EPA is conducting the requested cleaning and testing of lower Manhattan residential areas. DOHMH and ATSDR are developing a registry of those persons who were most highly exposed, including persons living, working, or attending school in lower Manhattan; persons who responded to the emergency; persons working at the WTC site or the Staten Island landfill following the attacks; and persons working in buildings that were damaged or destroyed in the attacks. The registry will track the health of participants to determine whether their exposures to smoke, dust, and airborne substances around the WTC site might have any short- or long-term impacts on their physical health. Additionally, the registry is intended to track the mental health of the approximately 100,000200,000 persons who might enroll. References 1.

In the first stage of the program, active surveillance is being conducted for potentially life-threatening, moderate-to-severe, and other serious adverse events and for vaccinia transmission to contacts of vaccinees (1) (Table). Nonserious events are reported via passive surveillance and are expected to be underreported. This report summarizes smallpox vaccine adverse events reported among civilians vaccinated as of Februar y 14, 2003, and received by CDC from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of February 18. Potentially life-threatening and moderate-to-serious events are classified on the basis of evidence in suppor t of the reported diagnoses. For probable cases, other causes are excluded, and supportive information is available. Events are classified as suspected if they have clinical features compatible with the diagnosis but either fur ther investigation is required or additional investigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the diagnosis and did not identify an alternative diagnosis. CDC and state health departments also receive reports of other events that are associated temporally with smallpox vaccination. Repor ted adverse events are not necessarily associated with vaccination, and some or all of these events might be coincidental. During January 24Februar y 14, 2003, smallpox vaccine was administered to 4,213 civilian health-care workers in 27 jurisdictions.

In 1999, a total of 167,000 deaths from stroke occurred; of these, approximately half occurred out of   Vol. 52 / No. 7  MMWR  137  hospital (2). A new CDC report, The Atlas of Stroke Mortality: Racial, Ethnic, and Geographic Disparities in the United States (3) provides, for the first time, an extensive series of national and state maps that show local disparities in stroke death rates for the five largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States. The maps provide health-care professionals and concerned persons with county-level maps of stroke mortality that are essential for tailoring stroke-prevention policies and programs to the needs of communities. High blood pressure and atrial fibrillation are important risk factors for stroke that can be prevented and controlled in reducing stroke-related deaths and disability. CDC funds health departments in 29 states and the District of Columbia to develop effective strategies for reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart disease and stroke) with an emphasis on policy and systems changes. Through these statebased programs, CDC aims to eliminate disparities in treatment, risk factors, and disease; delay the onset of disease; postpone death from cardiovascular disease; and diminish disabling conditions.  Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ nccdphp/cvd/stateprogram.htm. Detailed maps of stroke and heart disease mortality at state and county levels are available at http://www.cdc.gov/cvh. Additional information about stroke also is available from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at http://www.ninds.nih.gov, the American Stroke Association Division of the American Heart Association at http://www.strokeassociation.org, the Brain Attack Coalition at http://www.stroke-site.org, and the National Stroke Association at http://www.stroke.org.

GX004-37-3708548	Resources             Non-Human Primates   Rodents   Aged Rodent Tissue Bank   Interventions Testing Program   NIA DNA Microarray Facility   Human Biospecimen Collections   C. elegans  Genetic Stock   Cell Repository         Non-Human Primates  The NIA maintains approximately 150 nonhuman primates (M. mulatta) at four regional primate  centers for conducting research on aging. These animals range in age from 18 to 35 years.  These rhesus monkeys are currently only approved for non-invasive research.  The NIA Office of  Biological Resources and Resource Development has put together a compendium of Non-Human primate  resource availability for aging research.  Contact the  OBRRD  for a copy.      Rodents  The NIA maintains, through contract, both rat and mouse colonies for use by the scientific  community. These animals are housed behind specific pathogen barriers, maintained at 70 degrees F  and are fed NIH 31 (ad libitum). All rodents are regularly monitored for genetic purity and  health status, and a health monitoring statement for the room in which animals were raised  accompanies each shipment of animals. The animals available range in age from 1 to 36 months. Mouse genotypes currently available are the inbred strains BALB/cJNia, CBA/JNia, C57BL/6JNia,  DBA/2JNia and hybrid stocks of B6JC3J/Nia, B6JD2J/Nia, CJB6J/Nia. Available rat genotypes are  the inbred F344/NNia and BN/BiRijNia and the F1 hybrid F344BN/Nia. The NIA also maintains a colony of calorically restricted rats of the genotypes F344NNia, BN/BiRijNia, and F344BN F1 hybrid, which are available to the scientific community. The information handbook for the NIA Aged Rodent Colonies is available at  http://www.nia.nih.gov/research/rodent.htm . Please send requests for additional information about the Aging Rodent Resources to the  following address:  rodents@nia.nih.gov    On April 5, 2002, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) discovered genetic contamination  of the C57BL/6 mouse colonies in two of the NIA contract colonies at Harlan Sprague  Dawley.  Barrier 202C (Indianapolis, IN) houses half of the aging mouse colony and half  of the caloric restricted colony, and barrier 208B (Frederick, MD) houses the other half  of the caloric restricted colony.  The colony in barrier 218B (Prattville, AL), the other  half of the aging mouse colony, is unaffected.  All other strains in the NIA aging colonies  are unaffected.  The contamination appears to be FVB or an FVB-like strain and is  significant - several chromosomes show non-B6 identity. The loss of the affected mice  requires us to impose restrictions on the use of the NIA aged mouse colony until we  rebuild it, as described in the new  policy statement .  NIH  issuances are the only official NIH statements regarding this genetic contamination issue.  All  inquiries regarding this matter should be directed to Dr. Nancy Nadon, Head, OBRRD.     Aged Rodent Tissue Bank  The NIA supports a tissue bank of flash frozen tissues from mice and rats of several strains and ages from the aged rodent colonies.  Information and ordering procedure are provided in the  Aged Rodent Tissue Bank handbook .      Interventions Testing Program  The NIA supports a multi-institutional study investigating diets and dietary supplements  purported to extend life span and delay disease and dysfunction.   The  Interventions  Testing Program  allows investigators to submit proposals  for interventions to be tested for their ability to decelerate aging and extend life  span in mice.        NIA DNA Microarray Facility  The NIA DNA Microarray Facility  http://www.daf.jhmi.edu/microarray/index.htm   provides filter arrays of a 17K mouse cDNA clone set developed at the NIA Intramural Research  Program Laboratory of Genetics.  The majority (15K) of clones were derived from early embryonic cDNA libraries and  are described in Kargul et al., 2001, Nature Genetics 28:17-18.  Each array, a set of two filters per clone set,  also includes about 2,000 additional clones non-overlapping with the original 15K clone set, for a total of 17K clones  per array.

Russell, MD Kevin Tonat, DrPH, MPH for the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality. R. R. Parker1 Objective The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense has developed consensusbased recommendations for measures to be taken by medical and public health professionals if tularemia is used as a biological weapon against a civilian population. Participants The working group included 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions and agencies. Evidence MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2000, using the Medical Subject Headings Francisella tularensis, Pasteurella tularensis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. Consensus Process Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. Conclusions A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period.

Review of the bibliographies of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other published and unpublished references and sources for review. The first draft of the consensus statement was a synthesis of information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process. Members of the working group were asked to make written comments on this first draft in May 1999. Subsequent revised drafts were reviewed and edited until full consensus of the working group was achieved. HISTORY AND POTENTIAL AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON Tularemia was first described as a plaguelike disease of rodents in 1911 and, shortly thereafter, was recognized as a potentially severe and fatal illness in humans.12 Tularemia's epidemic potential became apparent in the 1930s and 1940s, when large waterborne outbreaks occurred in Europe and the Soviet Union13-15 and epizootic-associated cases occurred in the United States.16,17 As well, F tularensis quickly gained notoriety as a virulent laboratory hazard.18,19 Public health concerns impelled substantial early investigations into tularemia's ecology, microbiology, pathogenicity, and prevention.19-22 Francisella tularensis has long been considered a potential biological weapon. It was one of a number of agents studied at Japanese germ warfare research units operating in Manchuria between 1932 and 194523; it was also examined for military purposes in the West. A former Soviet Union biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibeck, has suggested that tularemia outbreaks affecting tens of thousands of Soviet and German soldiers on the eastern European front during World War II may have been the result of intentional use.24 Following the war, there were continuing military studies of tularemia. In the  1950s and 1960s, the US military developed weapons that would disseminate F tularensis aerosols10; concurrently, it conducted research to better understand the pathophysiology of tularemia and to develop vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment regimens. In some studies, volunteers were infected with F tularensis by direct aerosol delivery systems and by exposures in an aerosol chamber.10 A live attenuated vaccine was developed that partially protected against respiratory and intracutaneous challenges with the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis,6,7 and various regimens of streptomycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol were found to be effective in prophylaxis and treatment.25-27 By the late 1960s, F tularensis was one of several biological weapons stockpiled by the US military.10 According to Alibeck, a large parallel effort by the Soviet Union continued into the early 1990s and resulted in weapons production of F tularensis strains engineered to be resistant to antibiotics and vaccines.24 In 1969, a World Health Organization expert committee estimated that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of virulent F tularensis over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250 000 incapacitating casualties, including 19 000 deaths.28 Illness would be expected to persist for several weeks and disease relapses to occur during the ensuing weeks or months. It was assumed that vaccinated individuals would be only partially protected against an aerosol exposure. Referring to this model, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently examined the expected economic impact of bioterrorist attacks and estimated the total base costs to society of an F tularensis aerosol attack to be $5.4 billion for every 100 000 persons exposed.9 The United States terminated its biological weapons development program by executive order in 1970 and, by 1973, had destroyed its entire biological arsenal.10 Since then, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has been responsible for defensive medical research on F tu-  larensis and other potential biological warfare agents to better protect the US military, including protocols on decontamination, prophylaxis, clinical recognition, laboratory diagnosis, and medical management.29 The CDC operates a national program for bioterrorism preparedness and response that incorporates a broad range of public health partnerships.30,31 EPIDEMIOLOGY Geographic Distribution and Human Exposures  Tularemia occurs throughout much of North America and Eurasia.15,21,22,32 In the United States, human cases have been reported from every state except Hawaii; however, most cases occur in south-central and western states (especially Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).33-35 In Eurasia, the disease is also widely endemic, although the greatest numbers of human cases are reported from northern and central Europe, especially Scandinavian countries and those of the former Soviet Union.36,37 Tularemia is almost entirely a rural disease, although urban and suburban exposures occasionally do occur.38-41 Throughout its range, F tularensis is found in widely diverse animal hosts and habitats and can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation.15,20-22,32 A variety of small mammals, including voles, mice, water rats, squirrels, rabbits, and hares, are natural reservoirs of infection. They acquire infection through bites by ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, and by contact with contaminated environments. Although enzootic cycles of F tularensis typically occur without notice, epizootics with sometimes extensive dieoffs of animal hosts may herald outbreaks of tularemia in humans.16,22,42,43 Humans become infected with F tularensis by various modes, including bites by infective arthropods,42,44-47 handling infectious animal tissues or fluids,17,48,49 direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil,13,20,40,50,51 and inhalation of infective aerosols.43,52-56 Persons of all ages  2764 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Certain activities, such as hunting, trapping, butchering, and farming, are most likely to expose adult men. Laboratory workers are especially vulnerable to infection, either by accidentally inoculating themselves or by inhaling aerosolized organisms.18,22,56-58 Ordinary exposures during examination of an open culture plate can cause infection. Although F tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, its transmission from person to person has not been documented. Incidence  The worldwide incidence of tularemia is not known, and the disease is probably greatly underrecognized and underreported. In the United States, reported cases have dropped sharply from several thousand per year prior to 1950 to less than 200 per year in the 1990s.33-35 Between 1985 and 1992, 1409 cases and 20 deaths were reported in the United States, for a mean of 171 cases per year and a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.34 Persons in all age groups were affected, but most were children younger than 10 years and adults aged 50 years or older. Of 1298 cases for which information on sex was available, 942 (72.6%) occurred in males, and males outnumbered females in all age groups. Most cases occur in June through September, when arthropod-borne transmission is most common.17,35,59 Cases in winter usually occur among hunters and trappers who handle infected animal carcasses.17,35,48 In the United States, cases are mostly sporadic or occur in small clusters34,35,49; in Eurasia, waterborne, arthropod-borne, and airborne outbreaks involving hundreds of persons have been reported.40,43,44,51,53-55 Natural Occurrences of Inhalational Tularemia  The largest recorded airborne tularemia outbreak occurred in 1966-1967 in an extensive farming area of Sweden.43 This outbreak involved more than 600 patients infected with strains of the milder European biovar of F tularensis  (F tularensis biovar palaearctica) [type B]), most of whom acquired infection while doing farm work that created contaminated aerosols. Case exposures and disease onsets occurred during a period of months but peaked during the winter, when rodent-infested hay was being sorted and moved from field storage sites to barns. Among 140 serologically confirmed cases thought to have been infected by inhalation, most had typical acute symptoms of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, and malaise; only 14 (10%) of confirmed patients had symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and chest pains. Patients generally responded well to tetracycline, and no deaths were reported. Inhalational tularemia in the United States has involved only single cases or small clusters of cases, variously resulting from laboratory exposures,18,56,57 disturbance of contaminated animal carcasses,38,39,41 and suspected infective environmental aerosols.41,52 Cases of inhalational tularemia in the United States are thought to be due mostly to the more virulent F tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) and usually follow an acute and severe course, with prominent pneumonitis. Some cases, however, have radiographic evidence of pleuropneumonia with minimal or absent respiratory signs on physical examination.39,41,52 Although airborne F tularensis would be expected to principally cause primary pleuropneumonic infection, some exposures might contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. In the aforementioned Swedish outbreak, conjunctivitis was reported in 26% of 140 confirmed cases and an infected ulcer of the skin was reported in nearly 12%; pharyngitis was reported in 31% and oral ulcers in about 9% of the cases; and 32% of these patients had various exanthemas, such as erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.43 Tularemia outbreaks arising from similar agricultural exposures have been reported from Finland,53 mostly presenting with general constitutional  symptoms rather than specific manifestations of pneumonia; enlargement of hilar nodes was the principal radiographic finding in these cases.54 Inhalational Tularemia Following Use as a Biological Weapon  Although F tularensis could be used as a weapon in a number of ways, the working group believes that an aerosol release would have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Release in a densely populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of cases of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning 3 to 5 days later (incubation range, 1-14 days), with pleuropneumonitis developing in a significant proportion of cases during the ensuing days and weeks. Public health authorities would most likely become aware of an outbreak of unusual respiratory disease in its early stages, but this could be difficult to distinguish from a natural outbreak of community-acquired infection, especially influenza or various atypical pneumonias. The abrupt onset of large numbers of acutely ill persons, the rapid progression in a relatively high proportion of cases from upper respiratory symptoms and bronchitis to lifethreatening pleuropneumonitis and systemic infection affecting, among others, young, previously healthy adults and children should, however, quickly alert medical professionals and public health authorities to a critical and unexpected public health event and to bioterrorism as a possible cause (TABLE 1). Until the etiology became clear, clinicians would need to work closely with epidemiologists and diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the illness from various community-acquired pneumonias and to determine if it could have resulted from use of one of several potential bioterrorism weapons agents, such as those causing tularemia, plague, anthrax, or Q fever.2,4,29 In general, tularemia would be expected to have a slower progression of illness and a lower case-fatality rate than either inhalational plague or anthrax. Plague would most likely progress very 2765  2001 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Diagnosis of Inhalational Tularemia Following Use of a Biological Weapon Clinical Findings Sudden onset of acute febrile illness, progressing in some patients to pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, hilar lymphadenitis. Complications of overwhelming untreated infection may lead to sepsis and inflammatory response syndrome. Epidemiology Point-source outbreak pattern; likely urban, nonagricultural setting. Unexpected severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy persons. Risk related to degree of exposure with no differences in susceptibility by age or sex. Microbiology Small, gram-negative coccobacilli in direct stain of respiratory secretions. Sputum, tracheobronchial secretions, and blood should be cultured using cysteine-enriched medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates should be determined. Direct fluorescent antibody stain is first-line, rapid identification procedure at reference laboratories. Polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection procedures may also provide rapid identification. Microagglutination assay can detect serum antibodies beginning 10 days after illness onset. Virulence testing and molecular genetic characterizations are performed at specialized laboratories. Pathology Histological findings of acute suppurative necrosis followed by granulomatous reactions. Target organs include lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney. Radiology Peribronchial infiltrates leading to bronchopneumonia in 1 or more lobes, often accompanied by pleural effusion and enlarged hilar nodes. Signs may be absent or minimal, with only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates, or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura.  rapidly to severe pneumonia, with copious watery or purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and shock.4 Inhalational anthrax would be differentiated by its characteristic radiological findings of prominent symmetric mediastinal widening and absence of bronchopneumonia.2 As well, anthrax patients would be expected to develop fulminating, toxic, and fatal illness despite antibiotic treatment.29 Milder forms of inhalational tularemia could be clinically indistinguishable from Q fever; establishing a diagnosis of either would be problematic without reference laboratory testing. Presumptive laboratory diagnoses of plague or anthrax would be expected to be made relatively quickly, although microbiological confirmation could take days. Isolation and identification of F tularensis using routine laboratory procedures could take several weeks. Once a substantial cluster of cases of inhalational tularemia had been identified, epidemiological findings should suggest a bioterrorist event. The abrupt onset and single peak of cases would implicate a point-source exposure without secondary transmission. Among exposed persons, attack rates would likely  be similar across sex and age groups, and risk would be related to degree of exposure to the point source (Table 1). An outbreak of inhalational tularemia in an urban setting should trigger a high level of suspicion of an intentional event, since all reported inhalational tularemia outbreaks have occurred in rural areas. MICROBIOLOGY AND VIRULENCE FACTORS Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus. It has a thin lipopolysaccharide-containing envelope and is a hardy nonspore-forming organism that survives for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying animal carcasses.21,22,60,61 Francisella tularensis has been divided into 2 major subspecies (biovars) by virulence testing, biochemical reactions, and epidemiological features.62 Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) may be highly virulent in humans and animals, produces acid from glycerol, demonstrates citrulline ureidase activity, and is the most common biovar isolated in North America.22,60 Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is relatively avirulent, does not produce acid  from glycerol, and does not demonstrate citrulline ureidase activity. In Europe and Asia, all human tularemia is thought to be caused by the milder type B strains, although recent studies there have identified naturally occurring F tularensis related to F tularensis biovar tularensis. 63,64 A few rapidly growing strains of F tularensis have been recovered from the blood of immunocompromised patients not showing seroreactivity to F tularensis.65 Transformed plasmids have been engineered to express chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance in F tularensis.66 Virulent, streptomycin-resistant F tularensis strains have been examined in biowarfare agent studies both in the United States and the Soviet Union.24,27,56 Although F tularensis virulence factors are poorly understood and characterized,67,68 it is possible that strain virulence could be enhanced through laboratory manipulation. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pathogenesis  Francisella tularensis can infect humans through the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages.68,69 The major target organs are the lymph nodes, lungs and pleura, spleen, liver, and kidney.19,20,49,70-72 Untreated, bacilli inoculated into skin or mucous membranes multiply, spread to the regional lymph nodes and further multiply, and may then disseminate to organs throughout the body. Bacteremia may be common in the early phase of infection. The initial tissue reaction to infection is a focal, intensely suppurative necrosis consisting largely of accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by invasion of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. Suppurative lesions become granulomatous, and histopathological examination of the granulomas shows a central necrotic, sometimes caseating zone surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and fibroblasts in a radial arrange-  2766 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Bronchopneumonia was most pronounced in animals exposed to the smaller particles and was characterized by tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement and reddish, firm, 0.2- to 0.5cm-diameter discrete inflammatory lesions scattered throughout the lungs. In the absence of treatment, the disease progressed to pneumonic consolidation and organization, granuloma formation, and eventual chronic interstitial fibrosis. Humans with inhalational exposures also develop hemorrhagic inflammation of the airways early in the course of illness, which may progress to bronchopneumonia.54 Histopathological examination of affected lungs shows alveolar spaces filled with an exudate of mononuclear cells. Pleuritis with adhesions and effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are common radiological and pathological findings.70,72 Clinical Manifestations  The primary clinical forms of tularemia vary in severity and presentation according to virulence of the infecting organism, dose, and site of inoculum. Primary disease presentations include ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic forms.19,20,49,70,72,74,75 The term typhoidal tularemia has been used to describe illness in tularemia patients with systemic infections manifesting as fever and other constitutional signs without cutaneous or mucosal membrane lesions or regional lymphadenitis. Sometimes, these patients present with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea and pain. Confusion is created when typhoidal tularemia is used to describe the illness in patients infected by  inhalation, especially when there are signs of pleuropneumonic disease; this usage can be misleading and has been discouraged.54,75 The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever (38C-40C), headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. A pulsetemperature dissociation has been noted in as many as 42% of patients.49 A dry or slightly productive cough and substernal pain or tightness frequently occur with or without objective signs of pneumonia, such as purulent sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis.7,19,26,70,74 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea sometimes occur. Sweats, fever and chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. Studies of volunteers have shown that F tularensis aerosol exposures can incapacitate some persons in the first 1 or 2 days of illness, and significant impairment in performing tasks can continue for days after antibiotic treatment is begun.76 In untreated tularemia, symptoms often persist for several weeks and, sometimes, for months, usually with progressive debility. Any form of tularemia may be complicated by hematogenous spread, resulting in secondary pleuropneumonia, sepsis, and, rarely, meningitis.74,77 Prior to the advent of antibiotics, the overall mortality from infections with the more severe type A strains was in the range of 5% to 15%, and fatality rates as high as 30% to 60% were reported for untreated pneumonic and severe systemic forms of disease.72,78 Currently, the overall case-fatality rate of reported cases in the United States is less than 2%.34,49 Type B infections are rarely fatal. In ulceroglandular tularemia, the form that typically arises from handling a contaminated carcass or following an infective arthropod bite, a local cutaneous papule appears at the inoculation site at about the time of onset of generalized symptoms, becomes pustular, and ulcerates within a few days of its first appearance. The ulcer is ten-  Figure 1. Cervical Lymphadenitis in a Patient With Pharyngeal Tularemia  Patient has marked swelling and fluctuant suppuration of several anterior cervical nodes.

Typically, one or more regional afferent lymph nodes may become enlarged and tender within several days of the appearance of the papule. Even with antibiotic treatment, the affected nodes may become fluctuant and rupture. In oculoglandular tularemia, which follows direct contamination of the eye, ulceration occurs on the conjunctiva, accompanied by pronounced chemosis, vasculitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Glandular tularemia is characterized by lymphadenopathy without an ulcer. Oropharyngeal tularemia is acquired by drinking contaminated water, ingesting contaminated food, and, sometimes, by inhaling contaminated droplets or aerosols.14,20,36,43,50,51,79 Affected persons may develop stomatitis but more commonly develop exudative pharyngitis or tonsillitis, sometimes with ulceration. Pronounced cervical or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy may occur (FIGURE 1).74,79 Tularemia pneumonia can be the direct result of inhaling contaminated aerosols or be secondary to hematogenous spread from a distal site. An aerosol release of F tularensis would be expected to result in acute illness with signs and symptoms of 1 or more of pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pleuropneumonitis, and hilar lymphadenitis, accompanied by various manifesta2767  2001 American Medical Association.

Clinicians Caring for Patients With Suspected Tularemia Should Immediately Contact Their: (1) Hospital epidemiologist or infection control practitioner and (2) Local or state health departments Consult your local telephone operator, the telephone directory under ""governmental listings,"" or the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/other .htm#states or http://www.astho.org /state.html If the local and state health departments are unavailable, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (970) 221-6400 or http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid /dvbid.htm  more lobes, and often accompanied by pleural effusions and hilar lymphadenopathy (FIGURE 2).72,75 Signs may, however, be minimal or absent, and some patients will show only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura. Although volunteers challenged with aerosols of virulent F tularensis (type A) regularly developed systemic symptoms of acute illness 3 to 5 days following exposure, only 25% to 50% of participants had radiological evidence of pneumonia in the early stages of infection.7,26 On the other hand, pulmonary infection can sometimes rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.72,80 Lung abscesses occur infrequently.75 Typhoidal tularemia is used to describe systemic illness in the absence of signs indicating either site of inoculation or anatomic localization of infection. This should be differentiated from inhalational tularemia with pleuropneumonic disease.54,75 Tularemia sepsis is potentially severe and fatal. As in typhoidal tularemia, nonspecific findings of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be prominent early in the course of illness. The patient typically appears toxic and may develop confusion and coma. Unless treated promptly, septic shock and other complications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome may ensue, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and organ failure.80 DIAGNOSIS Tularemia in humans occurs infrequently, resulting in a low index of diagnostic suspicion among clinicians and laboratorians. Since rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available, the first indication of intentional tularemia might follow recognition by public health authorities of a clustering of acute, severe respiratory illness with unusual epidemiological features (Table 1). Suspicion of tularemia might be triggered in alert clini-  tions of systemic illness. Inhalational exposures, however, commonly result in an initial clinical picture of systemic illness without prominent signs of respiratory disease.7,43,53,56 The earliest pulmonary radiographic findings of inhalational tularemia may be peribronchial infiltrates, typically advancing to bronchopneumonia in 1 o r  cians encountering patients with findings of atypical pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Identification of F tularensis in clinical specimens may be missed or delayed for days or weeks when procedures for routine microbiological screening of bacterial pathogens are followed, and it is unlikely that a serendipitous laboratory identification would be the sentinel event that alerted authorities to a major bioterrorism action. Physicians who suspect inhalational tularemia should promptly collect specimens of respiratory secretions and blood and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Francisella tularensis may be identified by direct examination of secretions, exudates, or biopsy specimens using direct fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical stains.81-83 By light microscopy, the organism is characterized by its small size (0.2 m 0.2-0.7 m), pleomorphism, and faint staining. It does not show the bipolar staining characteristics of Yersinia pestis,4 the agent of plague, and is easily distinguished from the large gram-positive rods characteristic of vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis (FIGURE 3).2 Microscopic demonstration of F tularensis using fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public Health Laboratory Network; test results can be made available within several hours of receiving the appropriate specimens if the laboratory is alerted and prepared. Suspicion of inhalational tularemia must be promptly reported to local or state public health authorities so timely epidemiological and environmental investigations can be made (BOX). Growth of F tularensis in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia.60,81 Francisella tularensis can be grown from pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, and even fasting gastric aspirates in a high proportion of patients with inhalational tularemia.56 It is only occasionally isolated from the blood.

Selective agar (such as chocolate agar selective for Neisseria gonorrhea isolation) may be useful when culturing materials from nonsterile sites, such as sputum. Inoculated media should be incubated at 37C. Although growth may be visible as early as 24 to 48 hours after inoculation, growth may be delayed and cultures should be held for at least 10 days before discarding. Under ideal conditions, bacterial colonies on cysteineenriched agar are typically 1 mm in diameter after 24 to 48 hours of incubation and 3 to 5 mm in diameter by 96 hours.60,81 On cysteine heart agar, F tularensis colonies are characteristically opalescent and do not discolor the medium (FIGURE 4). Antigen detection assays, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassays, immunoblotting, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis, and other specialized techniques may be used to identify F tularensis and to characterize strains.84-87 These procedures are usually performed only in research and reference laboratories, however. In laboratories where advanced methods are  established, results of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction analyses can be obtained within several hours of receipt of isolates. Typically, serum antibody titers do not attain diagnostic levels until 10 or more days after onset of illness, and serology would provide minimal useful information for managing an outbreak. Serological confirmation of cases, however, may be of value for forensic or epidemiological purposes. Most laboratories use tube agglutination or microagglutination tests that detect combined immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.84,85 A 4-fold change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, a single titer of at least 1:160 for tube agglutination or 1:128 for microagglutination is diagnostic for F tularensis infection. Information on reference diagnostic testing and shipping/ handling of specimens can be obtained from state public health laboratories and from the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, Colo (telephone: [970] 221-6400; e-mail: dvbid@cdc.gov). VACCINATION Beginning in the 1930s, t he Soviet Union used a live attenuated vaccine to immunize tens of millions of persons living in tularemia-endemic areas.88 In  Figure 4.

Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  the United States, a live attenuated vaccine derived from the avirulent live vaccine strain has been used to protect laboratorians routinely working with F tularensis; until recently, this vaccine was available as an investigational new drug.89 It is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and its future availability is undetermined. In a retrospective study of civilians working with F tularensis at a US Army research facility, the incidence of accidental acute inhalational tularemia among laboratorians declined from 5.70 cases per 1000 person-years of risk at 2769  2001 American Medical Association.

Working Group Consensus Recommendations for Treatment of Patients With Tularemia in a Contained Casualty Setting* Contained Casualty Recommended Therapy Adults Preferred choices Streptomycin, 1 g IM twice daily Gentamicin, 5 mg/kg IM or IV once daily Alternative choices Doxycycline, 100 mg IV twice daily Chloramphenicol, 15 mg/kg IV 4 times daily Ciprofloxacin, 400 mg IV twice daily Children Preferred choices Streptomycin, 15 mg/kg IM twice daily (should not exceed 2 g/d) Gentamicin, 2.5 mg/kg IM or IV 3 times daily Alternative choices Doxycycline; if weight 45 kg, 100 mg IV twice daily; if weight 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg IV twice daily Chloramphenicol, 15 mg/kg IV 4 times daily Ciprofloxacin, 15 mg/kg IV twice daily Pregnant Women Preferred choices Gentamicin, 5 mg/kg IM or IV once daily Streptomycin, 1 g IM twice daily Alternative choices Doxycycline, 100 mg IV twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 400 mg IV twice daily *Treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, or ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days; treatment with doxycycline or chloramphenicol should be continued for 14-21 days. Persons beginning treatment with intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol can switch to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated.

In volunteer studies, the live attenuated vaccine did not protect all recipients against aerosol challenges with virulent F tularensis.7,26 Correlates of protective immunity appear about 2 weeks following natural infection or vaccination. Given the short incubation period of tularemia and incomplete protection of current vaccines against inhalational tularemia, vaccination is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis. The working group recommends use of the live vaccine strain only for laboratory personnel routinely working with F tularensis. TREATMENT Contained Casualty Situation  Table 3. Working Group Consensus Recommendations for Treatment of Patients With Tularemia in a Mass Casualty Setting and for Postexposure Prophylaxis* Mass Casualty Recommended Therapy Adults Preferred choices Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Children Preferred choices Doxycycline; if 45 kg, give 100 mg orally twice daily; if 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 15 mg/kg orally twice daily Pregnant Women Preferred choices Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily *One antibiotic, appropriate for patient age, should be chosen from among alternatives. The duration of all recommended therapies in Table 3 is 14 days. Not a US Food and Drug Administrationapproved use. Ciprofloxacin dosage should not exceed 1 g/d in children.  Adults. In a contained casualty situation, in which logistics permit individual medical management, the working group recommends parenteral antimicrobial therapy for tularemia (TABLE 2). Streptomycin is the drug of choice.49,74,90,91 Gentamicin, which is more widely available and may be used intravenously, is an acceptable alternative. 49,74,90-93 Treatment with aminoglycosides should be continued for 10 days. Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are also used to treat tularemia49,74,90; however, relapses and primary treatment failures occur at a higher rate with these bacteriostatic agents than with aminoglycosides, and they should be given for at least 14 days to reduce chance of relapse.27,74,90 Fluoroquinolones, which have intracellular activity, are promising candidates for treating tularemia. Ciprofloxacin, which is not labeled for use in tularemia, has been shown to be active against F tularensis in vitro94 and in animals95 and has been used to successfully treat tularemia in both adults and chil-  dren.90,94,96,97 Treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days. In persons beginning treatment with parenteral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, therapy can be switched to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated. Very limited experiences in treating tularemia patients with -lactam and macrolide antibiotics have been reported, and treatment failures have occurred.98 Use of -lactam and macrolide antibiotics in treating tularemia is neither FDA-approved nor recommended by the working group. Children. In children, streptomycin or gentamicin is recommended by the working group as first-line treatment in a contained casualty situation (Table 2). Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin ( 1 g/d), and chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives to aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause cartilage damage in immature animals and are not FDA-approved for use in children. However, short courses of these agents have not been associated with arthropathy in pediatric patients, and the potential risks of their use must be weighed against their benefits in treating serious infections.96,99,100 Mass Casualty Situation  Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, administered orally, are the preferred choices for treatment in the mass casualty setting, for both adults and children (TABLE 3). The ciprofloxacin dosage for children should not exceed 1 g/d. In a mass casualty situation, the working group believes the benefits to children from short courses of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (Table 3) outweigh the risks of their use. Since it is unknown whether drugresistant organisms might be used in a bioterrorist event, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates should be conducted quickly and treatments altered according to test results and clinical responses. Antibiotics for treating patients infected with tularemia in a bioterrorism scenario are included in a national pharmaceutical stockpile  2770 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

In a contained casualty situation, short courses of gentamicin are likely to pose a low risk to fetuses when used to treat tularemia in pregnant women (Table 2). Rare cases of fetal nerve deafness and renal damage have been reported with other aminoglycosides but have not been reported with gentamicin. The benefits of gentamicin in treating pregnant women with tularemia are expected to outweigh any potential risk to fetuses. In a mass casualty situation, oral ciprofloxacin is considered the best alternative to gentamicin for pregnant women (Table 3). Immunosuppressed Persons. There is scant experience in treating tularemia in immunocompromised patients. However, considering the greater occurrence in immunocompetent patients of tularemia relapses and treatment failures following use of bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents compared with aminoglycosides, streptomycin or gentamicin should be used when possible to treat patients with known immune dysfunction in either contained casualty or mass casualty situations (Table 2). POSTEXPOSURE ANTIBIOTIC RECOMMENDATIONS Persons beginning treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin in the incubation period of tularemia and continuing treatment daily for 14 days might be protected against symptomatic infection. In studies of aerosol challenge with infective doses of the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis, each of 8 volunteers given oral dosages of tetracycline, 1 g/d for 28 days, and each of 8 volunteers given tetracycline, 2 g/d for 14 days, were fully protected when treatment was begun 24 hours following challenge.27 Two of 10 volunteers given tetracycline, 1 g/d for only 5 days,  developed symptomatic tularemia after antibiotic treatment was stopped. In the unlikely event that authorities quickly become aware that an F tularensis biological weapon has been used and are able to identify and reach exposed persons during the early incubation period, the working group recommends that exposed persons be prophylactically treated with 14 days of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin (Table 3). In a circumstance in which the weapon attack has been covert and the event is discovered only after persons start to become ill, persons potentially exposed should be instructed to begin a fever watch. Persons who develop an otherwise unexplained fever or flulike illness within 14 days of presumed exposure should begin treatment as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. In the laboratory, persons who have had potentially infective exposures to F tularensis should be administered oral postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis if the risk of infection is high (eg, spill, centrifuge accident, or needlestick). If the risk is low, exposed persons can be placed on a fever watch and treated if they develop symptoms. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment of close contacts of tularemia patients is not recommended since human-to-human transmission of F tularensis is not known to occur. INFECTION CONTROL Isolation is not recommended for tularemia patients, given the lack of human-to-human transmission. In hospitals, standard precautions 101 are recommended by the working group for treatment of patients with tularemia. Microbiology laboratory personnel should be alerted when tularemia is clinically suspected. Routine diagnostic procedures can be performed in biological safety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Examination of cultures in which F tularensis is suspected should be carried out in a biological safety cabinet. Manipulation of cultures and other activities involving infectious materials with a potential for aerosol or droplet production (centrifuging, grinding, vig-  orous shaking, growing cultures in volume, animal studies) require BSL-3 conditions.102 When F tularensis is presumptively identified in a routine BSL-2 clinical laboratory (level A), specimens should be forwarded to a BSL-3 laboratory (level B) (eg, a state public health laboratory) for confirmation of agent and other studies, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.11 Bodies of patients who die of tularemia should be handled using standard precautions. Autopsy procedures likely to cause aerosols, such as bone sawing, should be avoided. Clothing or linens contaminated with body fluids of patients infected with F tularensis should be disinfected per standard precautions protocols.101 ENVIRONMENTAL DECONTAMINATION AND PROTECTION Under natural conditions, F tularensis may survive for extended periods in a cold, moist environment. The working group lacks information on survival of intentionally dispersed particles but would expect a short halflife due to desiccation, solar radiation, oxidation and other environmental factors, and a very limited risk from secondary dispersal. In circumstances of a laboratory spill or intentional use in which authorities are concerned about an environmental risk (eg, inanimate surfaces wet with material thought to contain F tularensis), decontamination can be achieved by spraying the suspected contaminant with a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach and 9 parts water). After 10 minutes, a 70% solution of alcohol can be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action of the bleach. Soap water can be used to flush away less hazardous contaminations. Persons with direct exposure to powder or liquid aerosols containing F tularensis should wash body surfaces and clothing with soap water. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal water sources should protect against waterborne infection.60 Following an urban release, the risk to humans of acquiring tula2771  2001 American Medical Association.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH Simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests that could be used to identify persons infected with F tularensis in the mass exposure setting need to be developed. Further methods should be designed to rapidly define the molecular genetic characteristics of organisms, especially as they may relate to engineered attributes, such as enhanced virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents or normally lethal environmental conditions. Complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of natural strains of F tularensis would provide an archival base for understanding genetic variants, functions of genes, and mechanisms of action useful in developing means to protect against F tularensis. Research is also needed to develop accurate and reliable procedures to rapidly detect F tularensis in environmental samples. New technologies should be explored for developing active (eg, DNAbased) or passive (eg, monoclonal antibodybased) vaccines for rapid preexposure or postexposure protection.

Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)  USDA       Information and Resources       First diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy     (BSE), widely known as ""mad cow disease,"" is a chronic, degenerative     disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle. 95% of all BSE cases     have occurred in the United Kingdom, but the disease has also been confirmed     in native-born cattle in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland    , France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg    , Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal    , Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland .      BSE belongs to the family of diseases known as the transmissible spongiform     encephalopathies (TSE's). Similar disease (  chronic     wasting disease  ) occurs in deer and elk, and in humans (kuru, Classical     Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD), etc.). These diseases are caused by a transmissible     agent which is yet to be fully characterized. In humans BSE is associated     with Variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD). These diseases share the following     common characteristics            a prolonged incubation period of months or years;         a progressive debilitating neurological illness which is always fatal;        when examined by electron microscopy, detergent treated extracts of brain       tissue from animals or humans affected by these diseases reveal the presence       of scrapie associated fibrils (SAF);        pathological changes appear to be confined to the CNS and include vacuolation,       and astrocytosis;        the transmissible agent elicits no detectable specific immune response       in the host which has inhibited the development of a preclinical live animal       diagnostic test to date.          New variant CJD is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder that emerged     in the U.K. in the mid-1990's. Although experience with this new disease     is limited, evidence to date indicates that there has never been a case transmitted     from person to person. Rather, the disease is thought to result from consumption     of cattle products contaminated with an agent that causes a disease called     bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease).             http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/fs020418.htm                                       Curator and Developer - Lorretta A.

Worldwide there have been more than 180,000 cases since the            disease was first diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain. BSE has had a            substantial impact on the livestock industry in the United Kingdom.            The disease has also been confirmed in native-born cattle in Austria,            Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,            Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands,            Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland.            However, over 95% of all BSE cases have occurred in the United Kingdom.            BSE is not known to exist in the United States.           BSE belongs to the family of diseases known as the transmissible spongiform            encephalopathies (TSE's). These diseases are caused by a transmissible            agent which is yet to be fully characterized. They share the following            common characteristics                       a prolonged incubation period of months or years;               a progressive debilitating neurological illness which is always              fatal;             when examined by electron microscopy, detergent treated extracts              of brain tissue from animals or humans affected by these diseases              reveal the presence of scrapie associated fibrils (SAF);             pathological changes appear to be confined to the CNS and include              vacuolation, and astrocytosis;             the transmissible agent elicits no detectable specific immune response              in the host which has inhibited the development of a preclinical live              animal diagnostic test to date.                     Similar Diseases of Humans and Other Animals           TSE's are caused by similar uncharacterized agents which usually produce            spongiform changes in the brain. TSE's include  scrapie             (which affects sheep and goats),  transmissible            mink encephalopathy , feline spongiform encephalopathy,  chronic            wasting disease  of deer and elk, and in humans, kuru, Classical            Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD), Gerstmann- Straussler syndrome, fatal            familial insomnia, and vCJD.           Clinical Signs of BSE in Cattle             Affected animals may display changes in temperament, such as nervousness            or aggression; abnormal posture; incoordination and difficulty in rising;            decreased milk production; or loss of body condition despite continued            appetite. There is no treatment, and affected cattle die.             The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 years. Following the onset            of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until it dies            or is destroyed. This usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months. Most cases            in Great Britain have occurred in dairy cows between 3 and 6 years of            age.           The Causative Agent of BSE            The causative agent of BSE as well as other TSE's is yet to be fully            characterized. Three main theories on the nature of the agent have been            proposed:                         An unconventional virus.               A prion or abnormal partially-proteinase K-resistant protein, devoid              of nucleic acid, capable of causing normal prion protein in the host              to change and form more abnormal protein.               A virino or ""incomplete"" virus composed of naked nucleic acid protected              by a host protein.                     The BSE agent (1) is smaller than most viral particles and is highly            resistant to heat, ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, and common            disinfectants that normally inactivate viruses or bacteria; (2) causes            no detectable immune or inflammatory response in the host; and (3) has            not been observed microscopically.           How BSE Is Currently Diagnosed             There is no test to detect the disease in a live animal. Currently            there are two laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of BSE: 1. microscopic            examination of the brain tissue to identify characteristic changes;            2. techniques to detect the partially-proteinase resistant form of the            prion (PrP res ) protein. These techniques are immunohistochemistry,            immunoblotting and ELISA.           Can the USDA guarantee that BSE will never occur in the United States?           There are still a number of unknowns regarding the origin and transmission            of BSE. Given these scientific uncertainties, we cannot assure zero            risk from BSE. However, we can and will continue to monitor new scientific            findings and world events and adjust our regulations and policies to            keep the risk of BSE infecting the national herd as low as            possible.           BSE Has NOT Been Found in the United States           No cases of BSE have been confirmed in the U.S.A. with 13 years of            active surveillance.           What About Other Animal TSE's in the US?           These TSE's HAVE been found in the United States:  Scrapie             in sheep and goats,  transmissible            mink encephalopathy , and  chronic            wasting disease  of deer and elk.           The Cause of BSE in Great Britain             Epidemiological data suggest that BSE in Great Britain is a common-source            epidemic involving animal feed containing contaminated meat and bone            meal as a protein source. The causative agent is suspected to be from            either scrapie- affected sheep or cattle with a previously unidentified            TSE. Changes in rendering practices in the late 70's—early 1980's            may have potentiated the agent's survival in meat and bone meal.                      For more information about BSE in the United Kingdom, please visit            the  Department            for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (formerly the Ministry of            Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, UK) web site.           Countries Other Than the United Kingdom With Confirmed Cases of            BSE           In native cattle: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,            France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,            Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal,            Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. While there is a decline            in the number of cases of BSE in the United Kingdom, confirmed cases            of BSE have risen in other European countries.              Oman, the Falkland Islands, Canada, and the Azores have detected BSE            in cattle imports from other countries known to have BSE.            On May 20, 2003, Canada had a cow test positive for BSE. Previously,            there had been one case of BSE in a single cow in Canada in 1993. It            had been imported from Great Britain and was dealt with by destroying            the affected cow and all its herdmates, as well as other cattle determined            to be a risk by animal health officials in Canada.          For more information, please see  Office            International des Epizooties .           Transmission of BSE            There is no evidence that BSE spreads horizontally, i.e., by contact            between unrelated adult cattle or from cattle to other species. Some            evidence suggests that maternal transmission may occur at an extremely            low level. Results of British research show that there is approximately            a 9-percent increase in the occurrence of BSE in offspring of BSE-affected            dams as compared to calves born to dams where BSE was not detected.            The study did not ascertain if this was the result of genetic factors            or true transmission. The research did however point out that at this            level if maternal transmission does occur it alone will not sustain            the epidemic (Wilesmith et al. 1997).             A recently published study found no evidence of disease transmission            via embryos collected from cows with BSE. The embryos were collected            and handled in accordance with international health standards (Wrethall            et. al., 2001).           About Classical  Creutzfeldt-Jakob            Disease (CJD)           CJD is a slow degenerative disease which affects the central nervous            system of humans. CJD occurs sporadically worldwide at a rate of approximately            1 case per 1 million people per year. More rare are the other TSE conditions            affecting humans: Gerstmann- Straussler syndrome, kuru, vCJD, and fatal            familial insomnia.           Classical CJD in the USA and in Britain           The incidence of classical CJD in the United States (about 1 case per            1 million population per year) is similar to the incidence found in            the rest of the world, which includes Australia and New Zealand--countries            that have NOT reported either scrapie or BSE. CJD, which was first diagnosed            in the 1920's, occurs with roughly the same frequency in Britain as            in other countries at the present time.             For more information on CJD in the United States, please visit the            Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  National            Center for Infectious Diseases website .           BSE and vCJD—Human Health Concerns            On March 20, 1996, the UK's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee            (SEAC) announced the identification of 10 cases of a new variant form            of CJD (vCJD). All of the patients developed onset of illness in 1994            or 1995. The following features describe how these 10 cases differed            from the sporadic form of CJD:                       The affected individuals were much younger than the classical CJD              patient. Typically, CJD patients are over 63 years old. The average              patient age for the onset of variant CJD was 28 (range of 12 to 74)              years.             The course of the disease in the vCJD averaged 14 months. Classical              CJD cases average a 4–6 month duration.              In the variant cases,  electroencephalographic (EEG) electrical              activity in the brain was not typical of classical CJD.             Although brain pathology was recognizable as CJD, the pattern was              different from sporadic CJD, with large aggregates of prion protein              plaques.                     Epidemiological and case studies have not revealed a common risk factor            among the cases of vCJD. According to the SEAC, all victims were reported            to have eaten beef or beef products in the last 10 years, but none had            knowingly eaten brain material. One of the affected individuals had            been a vegetarian since 1991.             The SEAC concluded that although there was no direct scientific evidence            of a link between BSE and vCJD, based on current data and in the absence            of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation at that time            was that the cases were linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction            of control measures, in particular, the specified bovine offal (SBO)            ban in 1989.            Research reported in later 1996 and 1997 has found evidence to further            support a causal association between vCJD and BSE. Two significant studies            published in the October 2, 1997 edition of  Nature  lead the SEAC            to conclude that BSE agent is highly likely to be the cause of vCJD.            Dr. Moira Bruce and colleagues at the Institute for Animal Health in            Edinburgh, Scotland inoculated 3 panels of inbred mice and one panel            of crossbred mice with BSE, vCJD and sporadic CJD. Results indicate            that mice inoculated with BSE showed the same pattern of incubation            time, clinical signs and brain lesions as mice inoculated with tissues            from patients with vCJD. This provides evidence that BSE and vCJD have            the same signature or are the same ""strain"". In addition, sporadic CJD            and known scrapie strains were not similar to vCJD or BSE.            Results from a study published by Dr. John Collinge and colleagues            of Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK strongly support            Bruce's results. Collinge's paper reports findings of BSE transmission            to transgenic mice expressing only human PrP.            Another paper by Collinge et. al. in the October 24, 1996 edition of             Nature  also provides data to support the association between            vCJD and BSE.            More recently, studies using transgenic animals expressing the bovine            PrP have supported the view that BSE infected cattle are responsible            for vCJD. These mice not only propagated the BSE infectious agent in            the absence of a species barrier, but also were highly susceptible to            vCJD. Furthermore, the transgenic mice inoculated with either vCJD or            BSE had indistinguishable disease characteristics.            Where has vCJD been detected?            vCJD has been detected in the United Kingdom. The  UK            CJD Surveillance Unit  provides a monthly update. There have also            been 6 cases of vCJD in France,1 in Ireland, and 1 probable case in            the United States and Italy.             On April 18th, 2002, the Florida Department of Health and the CDC reported            a likely case of new variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) in a 22-year-old            citizen of the United Kingdom living in Florida. The clinical diagnosis            was recently made at a hospital in the U.K. and she has since returned            to the U.S. Information provided by the U.K. indicates that the patient's            clinical condition and history are consistent with vCJD acquired in            the U.K. However, the only way to confirm a diagnosis of vCJD is through            study of brain tissue obtained by a brain biopsy or at autopsy.           New variant CJD is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder that            emerged in the U.K. in the mid-1990's. Although experience with this            new disease is limited, evidence to date indicates that there has never            been a case transmitted from person to person. Rather, the disease is            thought to result from consumption of cattle products contaminated with            an agent that causes a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy            (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease). To date, no case of this cattle            disease has been identified in the United States by the USDA.            If confirmed, this would be the first case of vCJD reported in a U.S.            resident. However, because the disease is thought to have a long incubation            period, CDC believes the patient acquired the disease while living in            the U.K.           For more information, please visit the  CDC            web site  or the  Florida            Department of Health web site .           BSE, vCJD and the International Traveler           The  Centers for Disease            Control  have published an advisory for international travelers.                        British vCJD Cases and the Scrapie Agent           The reason it is thought that the vCJD cases in Britain were NOT caused            by scrapie is because scrapie has existed in the sheep population in            the United Kingdom for over 300 years and has never been shown to be            a human health risk.             For more information, please visit the United Kingdom's  Department            of Health website.            USDA Actions            What is the USDA policy in regard to BSE, and what actions has USDA            taken?              The USDA policy has been to be proactive and preventative. APHIS has            taken measures in surveillance, prevention, education, and response.            Import restrictions have been in place since 1989, and active surveillance            efforts began in 1990. The USDA continually monitors and assesses all            ongoing events and research findings regarding spongiform encephalopathies,            as new information and knowledge may lead to revised conclusions and            prevention measures. APHIS has also created a Transmissible Spongiform            Encephalopathy (TSE) Working Group to analyze risks of BSE to the United            States, disseminate accurate information about the TSE's, and act as            a reference source for responding to questions about TSE's.            Is APHIS working with other agencies and groups to coordinate efforts?                         Yes. APHIS has actively shared information and met with State and Federal            agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC),            the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food Safety and Inspection            Service (FSIS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and stakeholders            to assure we are taking the proper actions in response to changing knowledge            and information concerning BSE.            Is BSE a notifiable disease in the United States?              Yes. Under Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 71 and 161, BSE            is a reportable disease by accredited veterinarians.            What types of  BSE surveillance             are we doing?              USDA-APHIS, in cooperation with USDA-FSIS and State diagnostic laboratories,            has a surveillance program which targets the segment of the cattle population            where the disease would most likely be found if it were to occur.                         APHIS educates veterinary practitioners, veterinary laboratory              diagnosticians, industry and producers on the clinical signs and pathology              of BSE.               APHIS monitors the remaining cattle imported from countries known              to have BSE or have high risk factors for BSE.               Since 1990, more than 60 veterinary diagnostic laboratories across              the United States and USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories              continue to examine hundreds of cattle brains each year submitted              from adult cattle displaying neurologic signs either at slaughter              or on the farm. FSIS performs antemortem slaughter inspection at all              federally-inspected slaughter establishments, and inspectors are alert              for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Any CNS suspect animals              are condemned and tested. Public health laboratories also submit to              APHIS any samples that have tested negative for rabies.               The network of private veterinary practitioners that refers unusual              cases to veterinary schools or State diagnostic laboratories around              the United States provides an extensive informal but important surveillance              system.               USDA has trained more than 250 State and Federal field veterinarians              located throughout the United States in the recognition and diagnosis              of foreign animal diseases, including BSE.               Veterinary pathologists at zoos in the United States routinely              conduct postmortem examinations on the brains of zoo animals exhibiting              neurologic signs since BSE-like encephalopathies have been diagnosed              in seven species of exotic Bovidae at zoos in England.                     What type of adult cattle do we test?                       Neurologically ill cattle found on farm             Neurologically ill cattle presented at veterinary diagnostic labs              or hospitals              Rabies-negative cattle              Cattle condemned at slaughter for neurologic disease             Non-ambulatory (down/fallen stock)             Adult cattle dying on farms from an unknown cause                                 Has the United States imported cattle from the United Kingdom?                         Yes. Between 1981 and 1989, 334 cattle were imported from the United            Kingdom and 162 from the Republic of Ireland. These imports have been            traced, and there are only 3 cattle still alive in the United States            (as of November 2001). These animals have been under quarantine since            April 1996. APHIS is currently attempting to purchase these cattle for            diagnostic purposes. In July 1989, the importation of live ruminants            from the United Kingdom was banned.             In addition, 5 head of cattle imported from other countries in Europe            in 1996 remain under quarantine. APHIS, in cooperation with the States            and industry, continues to purchase these animals for diagnostic purposes.            No evidence of BSE has been found in any of these imported animals.           Does the United States still permit the feeding of ruminant protein            to ruminants?              On August 4, 1997, the  Food            and Drug Administration (FDA)  established regulations that prohibit            the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants.            What proactive initiatives are underway to educate farmers, veterinarians,            extension agents, etc.?              An important part of the USDA's active surveillance program is the training            of veterinary practitioners in the clinical signs, diagnosis and sample            submission for BSE. Videotapes of cattle showing clinical signs of BSE            have been distributed to veterinarians in Federal and State governments,            veterinary diagnostic laboratories, and pathology departments of veterinary            colleges. Microscope slides showing typical BSE lesions have been distributed            to the above diagnostic laboratories, and Federal Foreign Animal Disease            (FAD) diagnosticians have trained in Great Britain in BSE recognition.            BSE factsheets, risk assessments, and reviews have also been sent to            State and Federal veterinarians, private practitioners, other industries,            and to producers. In addition, APHIS personnel have given numerous presentations            to various animal health groups. Finally, over 250 Federal and State            veterinarians throughout the US have been trained in the recognition            of FAD's including BSE.            What measures has USDA-APHIS taken to prevent the introduction of            BSE?              To prevent BSE from entering the United States, APHIS has restricted            the importation of live ruminants and certain ruminant products from            countries where BSE is known to exist.           In 1989, APHIS banned the importation of all ruminants and restricted            the importation of certain cattle products from the United Kingdom and            other countries where BSE was diagnosed.            On December 6, 1991, APHIS restricted the importation of ruminant meat            and edible products and banned most byproducts of ruminant origin from            countries known to have BSE (56 Federal Register [FR] 63868 and 63869).            Prior to this, the products were prohibited by not issuing permits.            Certain products cannot be imported into the United States, except            under special permit for scientific, educational or research purposes,            or under special conditions to be used in cosmetics. These products            include serum, glands, collagen, etc.            As of December 12, 1997, APHIS has prohibited the importation of live            ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe. The restrictions            applied to Albania, Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,            Czech Republic, Denmark, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Finland, Germany,            Greece, Hungary, Italy, the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia,            Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.            These actions were in addition to those already in place regarding countries            that had reported BSE in native cattle.            This action was taken in 1997 because the Netherlands, Belgium, and            Luxembourg have reported their first cases of BSE in native-born cattle.            There is evidence that European countries may have had high BSE risk            factors for several years and less-than-adequate surveillance.            An interim rule was published and the comment period closed on March            9, 1998. Criteria to assess the risk factors were developed in accordance            with the standards adopted by the  Office            of International Epizootics (OIE) .            Have we allowed the importation of cattle semen and embryos from            BSE-affected countries?              Yes.            No BSE infectivity has been detected in embryos, semen, or reproductive            tissues of BSE-affected cows and bulls. Embryo transfer experiments            have been completed in cattle. This recently published study found no            evidence of disease transmission via embryos collected from cows with            BSE. The embryos were collected and handled in accordance with international            health standards.           Importation protocols exceed the recommendation of the  Office            of International Epizootics (OIE) . All bulls producing semen for            export to the United States are required to meet all 5 of the following            conditions:                         The semen donor has not been on premises where BSE has occurred              within 5 years of the date of embryo or semen collection;               The semen donor is not affected with BSE;               No progeny of the semen donor is affected with BSE;               The parents of the semen donor are not affected with BSE; and               The semen donor has not been fed ruminant-derived protein.                    These importations were suspended during the first week of April 1996,          in response to the reported possible association of vCJD cases in the          United Kingdom and exposure to the BSE agent. We have since resumed the          importation of bovine semen as there is no scientific evidence to support          that semen harbors the BSE agent.            What actions are taken at USDA-inspected slaughter establishments            to ensure that cattle with neurological disease would not enter the            human food supply?              All cattle presented for slaughter in the United States are inspected            before slaughter by FSIS for signs of CNS impairment. Any animals exhibiting            neurologic signs during this inspection are condemned, and the meat            is not permitted for use as human food. The brains from these animals            are submitted to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for            analysis.            Does USDA have a response plan in the event a case of BSE or TSE            is diagnosed in US cattle?              In 1990, APHIS developed a plan to respond to a confirmation of BSE            in the US In August 1996, a joint APHIS-FSIS working group updated this            BSE response plan. The purpose of the plan is to provide a step-by-step            plan of action in the event that a case of BSE is detected in the United            States. The plan outlines those events that should take place, including            identification of a suspect animal, confirmation, the epidemiologic            investigation, animal and herd disposition activities, and communication            of information.  The plan has been shared with other government            agencies that have developed their own plans to coordinate with those            of USDA.

Given the parade of biotechnology firms lately to file for IPOs, market watchers might be wondering if they'll end up with an entire bowl. Jason Zhang, analyst with the Independent Research Group, a division of www.TheStreet.com, doubts that. Zhang, who does not cover Watertown, Mass.-based Acusphere, called the firm's IPO ""pretty brave, but diagnostic imaging is a different business. The buy side is not all that enthusiastic about IPOs"" of the more traditional kind yet, he said. See Acusphere, Page 3  CTI Raises $56M In Series B; Asthma Product To Benefit By Karen Pihl-Carey Staff Writer Privately held Critical Therapeutics Inc. raised $56 million in a Series B financing that will help the company develop its pipeline of anti-inflammatory products, including its lead drug for asthma. ""This comfortably takes us through commercialization of the product, which our present timelines put at the end of 2005,"" said Paul Rubin, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company's president and CEO. Rubin added that the money would probably carry the company all the way into 2006. The financing not only will help Critical Therapeutics (CTI) accelerate its clinical and preclinical development programs, but it also will help the company expand its research initiatives and create a sales and marketing See CTI, Page 5  Vicuron Starts Third Dalbavancin Phase III To Strengthen Package By Kim Coghill Washington Editor Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. started a Phase III trial to compare its antibiotic candidate, dalbavancin, with vancomycin, a standard of care for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections. The 1 50-patient Phase III is designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of dalbavancin compared to vancomycin for the treatment of adult patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) suspected or confirmed to be caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It's not the first Phase III for dalbavancin. Vicuron, of King of Prussia, Pa., plans to include the new Phase III trial as part of a new drug application based on two larger pivotal Phase III trials currently in progress. All three are expected to be completed by mid-2004, with data ready See Vicuron, Page 6  Partner Wanted: Sandia Seeking MicroChemLab Marketing Help By Karen Young Staff Writer Sandia National Laboratories is looking to team with companies in the private sector to bring its prototype, hand-held chemical and biotoxin detection system, called MicroChemLab, to the market. Livermore, Calif.-based Sandia dates back to the time of the Manhattan Project and is a research and development facility operated by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. Its goal is developing materials for national defense. The hope for MicroChemLab is that it can be used to detect toxic agents in the event of bioterrorism and for use in the military, but Sandia said there also are ""a variety of applications and near-term commercialization opportuniSee Sandia, Page 7  INSIDE:  OTHER NEWS TO NOTE (ISTA'S SECOND VITRASE NDA ACCEPTED)........2-6 APPOINTMENTS AND ADVACEMENTS ............................................................7  To subscribe, please call BIOWORLD Customer Service at (800) 688-242 1; outside the U.S. and Canada, call (404) 262-5476.

But Amersham added that no agreement has been reached and it plans to make a further announcement when appropriate. The company is a maker of diagnostic products and tools. Its shares (NYSE:AHM) gained $7.39 Wednesday, or 1 6. 1 percent, to close at $53.4 1 .  AVI BioPharma Inc., of Portland, Ore., said it would begin a second clinical study evaluating AVI-4020 in patients with West Nile virus, allowing expanded access to the Neugene antisense drug in response to requests from physicians for access to AVI-4020 for seriously ill patients who have limited treatment options. The new study would allow physicians to get AVI-4020 via requests through an FDA-approved protocol. Data from the new study would provide additional safety and efficacy information for further clinical development of the compound. AVI's ongoing study continues to enroll patients.  Berlex Pharmaceuticals, a U.S. affiliate of Schering AG, of Berlin, said pathologic findings to be published in the November edition of the Annals of Neurology describe its discover y that might lead to the development of an Alzheimer's disease-specific brain imaging biomarker for early diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. The company found that a receptor protein molecule, CCR1, which is usually found on the surface of white blood cells also is present in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Further, increasing levels of CCR1 in the brain correlate with advancement of the disease, Berlex said.  Bioenvision Inc., of New York, plans to begin later this year a Phase I dose-ranging trial of the more efficacious isoforms of the anticancer agent gossypol, subject to compliance with certain regulatory requirements. The company said it has developed a process to separate and purify iso-  forms of gossypol, and to manufacture each isoform in sufficient quantities for clinical use. Gossypol has shown efficacy against a range of human cancers, Bioenvision said, noting that collaborators at Bowman Research Ltd. in the UK discovered that one of the compound's two isoforms shows much greater anticancer activity than the other.  BioVision AG, of Hannover, Germany, and AstraZeneca plc, of London, entered a collaboration to focus on the discovery of new biomarkers of inflammatory disease. BioVision will apply its phenotyping approach, which is based on the high-resolution profiling of peptides and small proteins. It combines BioVision's Peptidomics technology with other processes and bioinformatics.  Cellectricon AB, of Gothenburg, Sweden, granted an exclusive license of its electroporation technology to Axon Instruments Inc., of Union City, Calif. Axon Instruments will incorporate the technology into its Axoporator line of products, used for internalization of DNA, drugs and large molecules into cells. The agreement includes undisclosed license fees and potential future royalties.  Cognia Corp., of New York, licensed its Transfac Professional database to research groups at Pfizer Inc., also of New York, and Chiron Corp., of Emeryville, Calif. Transfac and Transpath Professional provide information resources on gene transcription regulation.  Cytogen Corp., of Princeton, N.J., said it would report data at this week's International Union of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Human Proteome Organization meeting in Montreal, revealing new aspects of a signaling pathway implicated in cancer. More specifically, the company found links between ErbB-4 (a member of the epidermal growth factor protein-tyrosine kinase receptor family), WW-domain containing protein YAP (Yes-associated protein), tumor suppressor protein P73, and a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family in a signaling pathway regulating several cellular functions important to both the proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Cytogen said the findings represent the first in vivo validation of its in vitro drug discovery platform.

Although Acusphere is in a quiet period mandated by the SEC, John Thero, chief financial officer, was able to say that ""a number of investors went out of their way to say how pleased they were to say the life sciences IPOs are back."" He noted Acusphere's lead product, AI-700, is ""regulated as a drug by the FDA and injected into the body like a drug."" What's more, it is not the company's only candidate. ""We were very happy with the level of attention we received in the road-show process,"" Thero told BioWorld Today. Acusphere disclosed in its prospectus that proceeds from the offering  which gives the firm about 1 4.3 million shares outstanding  will finance efforts that include ongoing Phase III work with AI-700, an ultrasound contrast agent for myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial perfusion, or blood flow to the heart, is a marker for coronary artery disease. No ultrasound agent is available now, and the standard evaluator for myocardial perfusion is the costly, time-consuming nuclear stress test, which entails radiation. AI-700, made of hollow microparticles containing gas that reflects ultrasound, is aimed at a potential $1 .9 billion market in myocardial perfusion and might be used to trace abnormal blood flow in conditions such as coronar y arter y disease, cancer and disorders of renal arter y disease and the peripheral vascular system, the prospectus said. Incorporated in July 1 993 as Polymers for Medicine Inc., the company  which develops new drugs and new formulations of existing drugs using porous microparticles  changed its name in March 1 994. It has a cumulative net loss of $103.2 million from inception through June 30 of this year, including $64.6 million spent on research and development during the period. Phase III trials with AI-700 began earlier this year, and in April the company raised $20 million in its eighth round of financing. (See BioWorld Today, April 22, 2003.) Farther back in the pipeline are AI-850 and AI-1 28. The first, a formulation of the cancer drug paclitaxel, was devised using Acusphere's porous microparticle hydrophobic drug delivery system, which converts drugs with poor water solubility into tiny drug microparticles embedded in a water-soluble, sponge-like matrix. The idea is to enhance tolerability. A Phase I dose-escalation study with AI-850 is expected to finish next year. AI-1 28 is an inhaled, sustained-release asthma formulation developed in a joint venture with Dublin, Ireland-based Elan Corp. plc. However, that venture was terminated in October in a cash-free transaction triggered by Elan's restructuring. Acusphere got all the intellectual property  and development rights to product candidates in the joint venture's pipeline, including AI-1 28, for which it agreed to pay Elan royalties if revenues are realized. The Phase I study with AI-1 28 was completed in 2002. Acusphere said in the prospectus it expects development costs for AI-850 and AI-1 28 to drop ""until we are prepared to commence further preclinical and clinical testing using our own resources or through strategic collaborations."" Meanwhile, Zhang told BioWorld Today, don't expect an avalanche of IPO pricings. ""Will it be like what happened in 2000? No,"" he said. ""Investors are selective today. A few will do well, but a lot will have to go back to venture capital [funds] for more money."" Even in Acusphere's case, he said, ""the stock's been trading higher, but if you compare it to the open, it's down,"" although Zhang conceded that ""might have something to do with the overall market today."" Acusphere's stock rose as high $1 6.25 Wednesday. ""Very few companies [waiting to price an IPO] can compare to the already-listed stocks, where you can still find some good bargains,"" Zhang said. Acusphere filed for the IPO July 1, having withdrawn an earlier bid at the end of 200 1 . In the priced IPO, Acusphere has granted underwriters an option for another 562,500 shares of common stock to cover overallotments. The lead manager of the offering is SG Cowen Securities Corp., of New York. Co-managers are Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, of San Francisco; U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., of New York; and Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., of Arlington, Va.   O  THER  N  EWS  T  O  N  OTE   Dharmacon Inc., of Lafayette, Colo., entered a collaboration with Rosetta Inpharmatics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc., of Whitehouse Station, N.J., to develop a better understanding of factors affecting the potency and specificity of the short interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents used for RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. Dharmacon retains rights to commercialize certain resulting discoveries. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Endovasc Inc., of Montgomery, Texas, received approval from regulatory authorities in the Republic of Georgia to begin enrolling patients in its multicenter trial of Liprostin. The Georgian center is the first of eight sites to begin enrolling patients in the 1 20-patient, open-label study of the compound for patients with critical limb ischemia and intermittent claudication, but who do not require angioplasty. The other seven sites, located in Brazil, Mexico and Eastern Europe, are expected to begin enrollment before the end of the year.

The credit facility was syndicated to three lenders, led by GE and including Fleet National Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. Total funding of $105 million, including prior Series A and Series B funding rounds, have been raised less than 1 8 months after operations began at ESP, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, marketing and late-stage development of acute-care therapeutics. U.S. rights to its lead product, Cardene IV for hypertension, were acquired from Wyeth, of Madison, N.J., along with three other products.  Idun Pharmaceuticals Inc., of San Diego, initiated a Phase II trial of IDN-6556 in patients undergoing liver transplantation. IDN-6556 is designed to protect liver cells from apoptosis. The study will evaluate if IDN-6556 can decrease the cellular liver damage that can occur during the transport and transplant periods. The drug will be administered to the donor liver during transport to the transplant center, as well as to the liver recipient.  ILEX Oncology Inc., of San Antonio, began a Phase II study of the cancer compound ILX-65 1 . The U.S.-based multicenter study is designed to evaluate the tubulin-interactive agent's efficacy and tolerability in patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma. ILEX also said it plans to broaden the Phase II program later this year to include a study of the third-generation synthetic pentapeptide analogue of the natural substance dolastatin in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.  Integrated Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Boston, is expanding its operations to a new facility in Fitchburg, Mass., which will accommodate its additional therapeutic research programs including process development and production of biologics as well as biopharmaceuticals. The building will help the company expedite its biopharmaceuticals manufacturing activities, including the construction of a cGMP manufacturing facility.  ISTA Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Irvine, Calif., said the FDA accepted the filing of a second new drug application for Vitrase (ovine hyaluronidase), and would review the submission within six months from the application date. It was submitted two months ago seeking approval for use of Vitrase as a spreading agent to facilitate the dispersion and absorption of other drugs. ISTA also is seeking approval through the application's dosage and administration section to provide directions for reconstitution of Vitrase for potential treatment applications in the back of the eye. The submission was granted priority review status by the agency, which also is reviewing an application for the product's use in vitreous hemorrhage. (See BioWorld Today, Aug. 6, 2003, and April 8, 2003.)   Lorus Therapeutics Inc., of Toronto, is presenting results of preclinical studies aimed at assessing the potential therapeutic application of GTI-2040, for the treatment of breast cancer, at the American Association for Cancer Research special conference in Huntington Beach, Calif., that began Wednesday and continues through Sunday. Lorus examined the effects of combining GTI-2040 treatment with standard chemotherapeutic compounds, including doxorubicin, cisplatin and taxol. The antitumor activity of the tested combinations exceeded treatment with the single agents, it said. Also, GTI-2040 resulted in antitumor activity against chemotherapy-resistant human breast tumors implanted in mice.  MacroChem Corp., of Lexington, Mass., said it is engaged in a collaboration to evaluate a product candidate combining MacroChem's SEPA drug-absorption-enhancement technology with an undisclosed compound from Novartis AG, of Basel, Switzerland. The first phase of the ongoing collaboration was completed and additional testing is now beginning, the company said.  Nanosphere Inc., of Northbrook, Ill., through a licensing agreement with Northwestern University in Chicago, acquired nanoparticle detection technology for protein biomarkers. The technology, when combined with Nanosphere's nanoparticle-based detection systems for DNA, positions the company to impact the fields of molecular diagnostics, genomics and proteomics, it said. Nanosphere said its new technology exhibits 1 million times more sensitivity than standard methods in the detection of prostate-specific antigen.  NeurogesX Inc., of San Carlos, Calif., began a Phase II/III study of NGX-40 10 for neuropathic pain associated with HIV infection and AIDS. Severe pain, mostly in the feet, often occurs in up to one-third of HIV-infected individuals with long-standing HIV infection and AIDS, but is difficult to treat as no FDA-approved therapy is available to date, the company said. NGX-40 10 is a high-concentration capsaicin dermal delivery system that is being studied in various neuropathic pain conditions.  NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Salt Lake City, said it completed dosing of all patients in its Phase III trial of Preos, a recombinant, full-length human parathyroid hormone (PTH) for osteoporosis. The company expects results from the 1 8-month pivotal study, known as TOP (treatment of osteoporosis with PTH), late in the first quarter of next year. The trial enrolled nearly 2,700 patients at 1 65 centers in North America, Latin America and Europe to test Preos' ability to reduce fracture rates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Separately, NPS began a proof-of-concept study of teduglutide (ALX-0600) for Crohn's disease. The multicenter trial will enroll about 100 patients divided four ways, with three groups receiving various doses of teduglutide, a derivative of a naturally occurring protein involved in the regulation of various processes of the gastrointestinal tract. The fourth group will receive placebo.  To subscribe, please call BIOWORLD Customer Service at (800) 688-242 1; outside the U.S. and Canada, call (404) 262-5476. Copyright  2003 Thomson BioWorld.

Tanox will reser ve the rights for therapeutic applications identified through the collaboration. OriGene will retain the rights for research and diagnostic reagent development.  Prima Biomed Ltd., of Melbourne, Australia, reported that its subsidiary, Cancer Vac, entered an agreement with Progen Industries Ltd., of Brisbane, Australia, to begin the scale-up manufacture for a therapeutic vaccine in its Phase II trial. Marcus Clark, CEO of Prima Biomed, said Progen will undertake the scale-up activities to produce a GMP grade of therapeutic vaccine.  Proneuron Biotechnologies Inc., of Los Angeles, said it would soon begin a Phase II study in the U.S. of its macrophage therapy (ProCord) for acute complete spinal cord injury. The company, which already provides the treatment in Israel, reviewed the trial's protocol with investigators and participants from four U.S. centers. According to the study's guidelines, investigators must be notified of a patient within a few days of the injury, and ProCord must be administered within 1 4 days of the injury.  RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals Inc., of Bethesda, Md., completed a Phase I trial with its lead therapy, Thymosin beta-4, a wound-healing drug. Twenty volunteers were subjects of the six-month study that was initiated in March 2003 and designed to evaluate four different dosage regimens. TB4 is a naturally occurring 43-amino-acid peptide that is needed for the repair and remodeling of injured tissues, the company said.  Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc., of East Brunswick, N.J., said the FDA issued an approvable letter related to its sodium hyaluronate product for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. The agency wrote that approval of the product's premarket approval application remains subject to satisfactor y audit of Savient's new manufacturing facility in Israel and the finalization of product labeling. Arthrease, a treatment of three weekly injections, is approved and marketed in Europe and Israel. The high-molecular-weight formulation was developed and manufactured by Savient's wholly owned subsidiar y, Bio-Technology General Ltd., in Israel. Savient last month reacquired commercial rights to the product from DePuy Orthopaedics Inc., a unit of Johnson & Johnson, of New Brunswick, N.J. DePuy had exclusive worldwide rights except in Japan and Israel, and marketed the product in Europe as Arthrease. It will continue to be marketed as Arthrease in Israel, though in Europe and the U.S. it will be marketed under another name, still  undisclosed.  Serono Inc., of Rockland, Mass., the U.S. affiliate of Serono SA, of Geneva, Switzerland, said the FDA approved its new prefilled syringe for Ovidrel (choriogonadotropin alpha injection), making it the first liquid, ready-to-inject therapy for infertility treatment in the U.S. Unlike other infertility treatments, the Ovidrel Pre-Filled Syringe does not require patients to mix medication prior to injection, the company said.  CTI  Continued from Page 1 infrastructure, Rubin said. According to BioWorld Snapshots, the Series B financing is the largest private round by a biotech company this year. CTI in-licensed its lead drug, which already is approved for asthma but in an oral form that is administered four times daily. The company has rights for a sustained-release version, which it calls CTI-02, and is developing both an oral and intravenous form that would be administered twice daily. All of the clinical work in asthma is complete, Rubin told BioWorld Today. The company expects to begin clinical trials in emphysema sometime in 2004. A launch of CTI-02 in asthma is expected by the end of 2005. CTI has raised about $75 million in venture funds to date. Its anti-inflammatory products include two clinical programs and three preclinical programs that target acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The products include the lead drug, as well as a cytoprotective drug, CTI-0 1, to reduce trauma-related vascular and organ damage. ""We finished single-dose Phase I trials and are moving on to the next phase,"" Rubin said. He expects CTI-0 1 to enter Phase II sometime next year. The company also has a biologic product targeting HMGB-1 . It is a pro-inflammatory cytokine to treat severe inflammatory diseases and is partnered with MedImmune Inc., of Gaithersburg, Md. (See BioWorld Today, Aug. 1, 2003.) It also is developing small-molecule and vagal nervestimulation approaches to treat inflammation.

Vicuron anticipates filing the NDA during the second half of 2004. Dalbavancin, a semi-synthetic glycopeptide antibiotic, is a once-weekly, injectable, hospital-based treatment that belongs to the same class as vancomycin, one of the few products available to treat MRSA and MRSE (methicillinresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis). Company officials believe dalbavancin boasts marketing advantages because of its once-weekly dosing. ""This dosing regimen allows for cost-effective administration and a reduced need for intravenous lines that can prolong the risk of local and bloodstream infection, which may translate into shorter hospital stays for some patients,"" George Horner, Vicuron's president and CEO, said in a prepared statement. The Phase III comparative study announced Wednesday is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label trial. Patients will receive either two doses of intravenous dalbavancin  the first dose on day one followed by a second dose on day eight  or twice daily doses of intravenous vancomycin for 1 4 days. The primary endpoint will be the assessment of clinical response at the time of a follow-up visit. Meanwhile, Vicuron continues enrolling the pivotal studies. While Goldstein wouldn't discuss specifics surrounding the number of patients enrolled, he did say the trials were on schedule. Initiated in December by Versicor Inc. before it merged  with Biosearch Italia SpA and Vicuron was born, the pivotal Phase III studies are randomized, double-blind trials. Each is designed to evaluate about 550 hospitalized patients receiving dalbavancin vs. standard antibiotics. (See BioWorld Today, Dec. 1 8, 2002, and Aug. 1, 2002.) In the first trial, patients with complicated SSTIs will receive either a 1-gram dose of dalbavancin on the first day followed by a 500-mg dose on the eighth day, or doses of linezolid for 1 4 days. In the second trial, patients with uncomplicated SSTIs will receive either a 1-gram dose of dalbavancin the first day with the option of a 500-mg dose on the eighth day or intravenous cefazolin, followed by oral cephalexin. On day eight, the investigator will decide the duration of the study therapy (seven or 1 4 days) based on the patient's status. Dalbavancin actually was discovered by Biosearch Italia, of Milan, Italy, although Versicor, of Fremont, Calif., had in-licensed North American rights. Through the $225 million stock swap that merged the companies, all the rights now reside with Vicuron. Goldstein said Vicuron plans to sell dalbavancin on its own in North America and Europe, but expects to outlicense the product in Japan. Beyond dalbavancin, Vicuron expects to launch (also on its own) its lead product candidate, anidulafungin, in the first half of 2004. The FDA currently is reviewing the NDA for anidulafungin, an antifungal agent for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, an infection of the esophagus that commonly affects patients with compromised immune systems. (See BioWorld Today, April 29, 2003.) Vicuron's stock (NASDAQ:MICU) closed Wednesday at $1 8.59, down 4 cents.  one case, a finding later confirmed by gene sequencing.  Xenova Group plc, of Slough, UK, initiated a second trial for TN-NIC, its therapeutic vaccine under development for nicotine addiction. About 60 smokers will be recruited in the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Results of the study will be used to design a Phase II trial to assess the effect of vaccination with TN-NIC on tobacco consumption. The Phase II trial is expected to begin during the second half of 2004.  O  THER  N  EWS  T  O  N  OTE   SK Bio-Pharmaceuticals, of Fairfield, N.J., a subsidiary of SK Corp., said the FDA approved its investigational new drug application for the schizophrenia drug YKP1 358. The company plans to begin U.S. clinical testing by the end of the year. The compound, which has demonstrated activity in animals that relates to both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, was discovered at SK's research facilities in Fairfield and Shanghai, China; and the Taedok Institute of Technology in Korea.

""We are looking for partners to license subcomponents that are actually really close to being ready to go, license blocks of intellectual property relating to the MicroChemLab unit, to cooperatively develop and research additional applications for [MicroChemLab] and we're looking for a systems integrator,"" said Jill Micheau, a business development associate at Sandia. ""We'd really like to find somebody who can put these things together and push them out into the market, because the Department of Homeland Security would like these to be available to first responders."" As to whether those partners would be many or few, Micheau said it depends on the companies that approach Sandia. ""We certainly don't know how this commercialization opportunity will turn out,"" she said. ""I think that there are so many different avenues and applications for MicroChemLab, we will probably be partnering with many companies that have different interests in applications."" MicroChemLab has two components at this point: MicroChemLab BD (Bio-Detection) and MicroChemLab CD (Chemical Detection). One of the hopes for a partner is that the two ""boxes"" can be brought together in an ""elegant"" fashion, Micheau said. MicroChemLab BD is a liquid-phase system that is microfluidic based and is designed to discriminate proteins to detect and identify biotoxins, viruses and bacterial agents. The first generation of the system was taken to the Defense Science and Technology Laborator y in Porton  Down, UK, to test its ability to detect biotoxin variants. ""It successfully detected seven different forms of ricin and could distinguish between two staphylococcal enterotoxin variants,"" Sandia said, noting that the event helped develop a second prototype, which is scheduled for field trials this fall. MicroChemLab CD involves two gas-phase systems  one hand held and one autonomous  that can be used for the detection of chemical warfare agents and a selection of toxic industrial chemicals, explosives and organic solvents. The systems have been tested with ner ve and blister agents. Two of the units have been sent to the U.S. Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Command for testing. Sandia said a stationar y gas-phase system that performs readings every two minutes is currently deployed in the Boston subway system and has performed more than 100,000 tests with no false positive readings. Sandia's research and development role prevents it from taking products to the market, but it does have ""robust working prototypes,"" Micheau said. ""The laboratories are not very product focused,"" she said. ""They generally take things to the prototype phase, and then we wait for the market to take it."" As for a timeframe of when it wants to partner, Micheau said, ""Yesterday""  mainly because the goal is to have the two platforms being produced within two years. ""When we search for licensing agreements, we do hope to recover a portion of our research costs, so it's a standard business agreement where companies could license our intellectual property and in return provide the laboratories with royalties,"" Micheau said, noting that any royalties would be funneled back into additional research.  president and Gerard Vlak vice chairman of the board.

The disease was first diagnosed in 1986 in            Great Britain.            BSE has had a substantial impact on the livestock industry in the United            Kingdom. The disease also has been confirmed in native-born cattle in            Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,            Italy, Ireland, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Northern            Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. The U.S.            Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection            Service (APHIS) is enforcing import restrictions and is conducting surveillance            for BSE to ensure that this serious disease does not become established            in the United States.            Clinical Signs            Cattle affected by BSE experience progressive degeneration of the            nervous system. Affected             animals may display changes in temperament, such as nervousness or aggression,            abnormal posture, incoordination and difficulty in rising, decreased            milk production, or loss of body weight despite continued appetite.            Affected cattle die. The causative agent of the disease is not completely            characterized, and there is neither any treatment nor a vaccine to prevent            the disease.            The incubation period (the time from when an animal becomes infected            until it first shows disease signs) is from 2 to 8 years. Following            the onset of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until            it either dies or is destroyed. This process usually takes from 2 weeks            to 6 months. Most cases in Great Britain have occurred in dairy cows            between 3 and 6 years of age.            Currently, there is no test to detect the disease in a live animal;            veterinary pathologists confirm BSE by postmortem microscopic examination            of brain tissue or by the detection of the abnormal form of the prion            protein. BSE is so named because of the spongy appearance of the brain            tissue of infected cattle when sections are examined under a microscope.           History            Since November 1986 (when BSE was first identified as a separate disease            entity), over 178,000 head of cattle have been diagnosed with BSE in            Great Britain. The epidemic peaked in January 1993 at approximately            1,000 new cases reported per week. Agricultural officials in Great Britain            have taken a series of actions to eradicate BSE, including making BSE            a notifiable disease, prohibiting the inclusion of mammalian meat-and-bone            meal in feed for all food-producing animals, prohibiting the inclusion            of animals more than 30 months of age in the animal and human food chains,            and destroying all animals showing signs of BSE and other animals at            high risk of developing the disease.            As a result of these actions, most notably the imposition of feed            bans, the rate of newly reported cases of BSE has greatly decreased.           Epidemiology            Epidemiologic data suggest BSE in Great Britain is an extended common            source epidemic involving animal feed containing contaminated meat and            bone meal as a protein meat source.            There are different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of            BSE. BSE in Great Britain may have been caused by feeding cattle rendered            protein produced from the carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep or cattle            with a previously unidentified TSE. The practice of using products such            as meat-and-bone meal as a source of protein in cattle rations has been            common for several decades. Changes in rendering operations in the late            1970's and early 1980's may have played a part in the appearance of            the disease.            There is no evidence that BSE spreads horizontally, i.e., by contact            between unrelated adult cattle or contact between cattle and other species.            Limited research suggests that maternal or vertical transmission may            occur at a very low level. This low level most likely would not perpetuate            the epidemic under British farming conditions. Research continues in            this area.            BSE is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).            The agent responsible for BSE and other TSE’s is smaller than            the smallest known virus and has not been completely characterized.            There are three main theories on the nature of the agent: (1) the agent            is a virus with unusual characteristics, (2) the agent is a prion-an            exclusively host-coded protein that is modified to a partially protease-resistant            form after infection, and (3) the agent is a virino-a small, noncoding            regulatory nucleic acid coated with a host-derived protective protein.            The BSE agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization            processes. It also does not evoke any detectable immune response or            inflammatory reaction in host animals.            In cattle naturally infected with BSE, the BSE agent has been found            only in brain tissue, in the spinal cord, and in the retina. The distal            ileum, bone marrow, dorsal root ganglion, and trigeminal ganglion from            experimentally infected cattle were also found to be infective. To date,            there has been no evidence of infection detected in milk or muscle tissue.                     The presence of the BSE agent in tissues is determined by inoculating            animals, usually mice, with material believed to be infected with BSE.            Mouse inoculation studies take a long time (up to 700 days) to detect            the agent, and failure to identify it in tissues may indicate either            true absence of the agent or simply the limited sensitivity of current            diagnostic methods.            Related Diseases            The TSE family of diseases includes scrapie, which affects sheep and            goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy; feline spongiform encephalopathy;            chronic wasting disease of deer and elk; and in humans, kuru, both classic            and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker            syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. TSE’s have also been reported            in captive exotic ruminants, and exotic and domestic cats. The agent            isolated from several of these cases is indistinguishable from BSE in            cattle suggesting the occurrence of TSE's in these species resulted            from BSE-contaminated feed.            On March 20, 1996, the United Kingdom's Spongiform Encephalopathy            Advisory Committee (SEAC) announced the identification of 10 cases of            variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These 10 cases had a characteristic            clinical and pathological phenotype which differed from other routinely            diagnosed cases of classic (sporadic) CJD in that they are characterized            by a younger age at onset of symptoms, have behavioral change symptoms,            longer duration of illness, a non-diagnostic or normal EEG tracing,            and, under microscopic examination, different lesions in brain tissues.                     SEAC concluded that, although there was no direct scientific evidence            of a link between BSE and vCJD, based on current data and in the absence            of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation at that time            was that the cases were linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction            of a specified bovine offal (SBO) ban at slaughter in 1989. The SBO            ban excluded from human consumption brain, spinal cord, and other organs            with potential BSE infectivity. As of Nov. 2, 2001, 114 cases of vCJD            had been identified in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, and five            in France.            It is important to further clarify the difference between classic CJD            and vCJD. Classic CJD occurs each year at a rate of 1 to 2 cases per            1 million people throughout the world, including in the United States            and other countries where BSE has never occurred and among vegetarians            and meat eaters alike. Classic CJD occurs sporadically (about 90 percent            of cases), through iatrogenic transmissions (less than 1 percent) or            genetically (about 10 percent). Current evidence suggest that vCJD is            a novel condition, clinically and pathologically. The epidemiological            evidence is consistent with BSE and the causal agent and recent laboratory            evidence provides strong support to the hypothesis of a causal link            between BSE and vCJD.            USDA Actions in Response to BSE            BSE has not been diagnosed in the United States, and USDA has worked            proactively to keep it that way. In cooperation with USDA's Food Safety            and Inspection Service (FSIS), APHIS has taken stringent measures in            prevention, education, surveillance, and response.            To prevent BSE from entering the country, since 1989 APHIS has prohibited            the importation of live ruminants from countries where BSE is known            to exist in native cattle. Other products derived from ruminants, such            as fetal bovine serum, bonemeal, meat-and-bone meal, bloodmeal, offal,            fats, and glands, are also prohibited from entry, except under special            conditions or under USDA permit for scientific or research purposes.                                    On December 12, 1997, APHIS extended these restrictions to include all            of the countries in Europe due to concerns about widespread risk factors            and inadequate surveillance for BSE.            As of December 7, 2000, USDA prohibited all imports of rendered animal            protein products, regardless of species, from Europe. This decision            followed the recent determination by the European Union that feed of            nonruminant origin was potentially cross-contaminated with the BSE agent.            The restriction applies to products originating, rendered, processed            or otherwise associated with European products. USDA has taken emergency            action to prevent potentially cross-contaminated products from entering            the United States. The same type of rendered product from ruminant origin            has been prohibited from BSE-infected countries since 1989.            APHIS educates veterinary practitioners, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians,            industry, and producers on the clinical signs and pathology of BSE.            APHIS leads an ongoing, comprehensive, interagency surveillance program            for BSE in the United States. BSE is a reportable disease by accredited            veterinarians. APHIS veterinary pathologists and field investigators            have received training, including training from their British counterparts            in diagnosing BSE.            The surveillance samples include field cases of cattle exhibiting signs            of neurological disease, cattle condemned at slaughter for neurologic            reasons, rabies-negative cattle submitted to public health laboratories,            neurologic cases submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories and            teaching hospitals, and sampling of cattle that are nonambulatory (downer            cattle/fallen stock).           APHIS has also begun to sample adult cattle that die on farms. APHIS'            surveillance program is based on laboratories' histopathologically examining            brains and using a technique called immunohistochemistry to test brain            tissues for the presence of the abnormal prion protein. As of Feb. 4,            2002, more than 21,451 brains from the United States and Puerto Rico            have been examined with no evidence of BSE or other TSE detected.            APHIS also monitors the remaining cattle imported from Great Britain,            Belgium, and other European countries (before the bans on imports from            those countries went into effect). As of Dec. 31, 2000, of the 496 cattle            imported from Great Britain and Ireland between 1981 and 1989, three            animals are still alive. The animals are quarantined and observed regularly.            To date, no evidence of BSE or a TSE has been detected. There are five            head of cattle from other European countries imported between 1986-97            that are still alive and under quarantine.            APHIS, in cooperation with the Food Safety and Inspection Service,            has also drafted an emergency response plan to be used in the event            that BSE is identified in United States. In addition, APHIS' TSE Working            Group monitors and assesses all ongoing events and research findings            regarding TSE's. APHIS continually revises and adjusts prevention and            diagnostic measures as it receives new information and knowledge.            As an additional preventative measure, APHIS supports the Food and            Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation (effective August 4, 1997) prohibiting            the use of most mammalian protein (with certain exceptions) in the manufacture            of animal feeds given to ruminants. In addition, the final regulation            also requires process and control systems to ensure that ruminant feed            does not contain the prohibited mammalian tissues.

Numerous briefings have been held for industry groups.

GX229-32-2020309	"APHIS Veterinary Services  Factsheet February 2002  Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), widely referred to as ""mad cow disease,"" is a chronic degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of cattle. The disease was first diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain. BSE has had a substantial impact on the livestock industry in the United Kingdom. The disease also has been confirmed in native-born cattle in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Nor thern Ireland, Por tugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. The U.S. Depar tment of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is enforcing impor t restrictions and is conducting surveillance for BSE to ensure that this serious disease does not become established in the United States.  History Since November 1986 (when BSE was first identified as a separate disease entity), over 178,000 head of cattle have been diagnosed with BSE in Great Britain. The epidemic peaked in January 1993 at approximately 1,000 new cases repor ted per week. Agricultural officials in Great Britain have taken a series of actions to eradicate BSE, including making BSE a notifiable disease, prohibiting the inclusion of mammalian meat-and-bone meal in feed for all food-producing animals, prohibiting the inclusion of animals more than 30 months of age in the animal and human food chains, and destroying all animals showing signs of BSE and other animals at high risk of developing the disease. As a result of these actions, most notably the imposition of feed bans, the rate of newly repor ted cases of BSE has greatly decreased.  Epidemiology Epidemiologic data suggest BSE in Great Britain is an extended common source epidemic involving animal feed containing contaminated meat and bone meal as a protein meat source. There are different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of BSE. BSE in Great Britain may have been caused by feeding cattle rendered protein produced from the carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep or cattle with a previously unidentified TSE. The practice of using products such as meatand-bone meal as a source of protein in cattle rations has been common for several decades. Changes in rendering operations in the late 1970's and early 1980's may have played a par t in the appearance of the disease. There is no evidence that BSE spreads horizontally, i.e., by contact between unrelated adult cattle or contact between cattle and other species. Limited research suggests that maternal or ver tical transmission may occur at a very low level. This low level most likely would not perpetuate the epidemic under British farming conditions. Research continues in this area. BSE is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The agent responsible for BSE and other TSE's is smaller than the smallest known virus and has not been completely characterized. There are three main theories on the nature of the agent: (1) the agent is a virus with unusual characteristics, (2) the agent is a prion--an exclusively host-coded protein that is modified to a par tially protease-resistant form after infection, and (3) the  Clinical Signs Cattle affected by BSE experience progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Affected animals may display changes in temperament, such as nervousness or aggression, abnormal posture, incoordination and difficulty in rising, decreased milk production, or loss of body weight despite continued appetite. Affected cattle die. The causative agent of the disease is not completely characterized, and there is neither any treatment nor a vaccine to prevent the disease. The incubation period (the time from when an animal becomes infected until it first shows disease signs) is from 2 to 8 years. Following the onset of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until it either dies or is destroyed. This process usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months. Most cases in Great Britain have occurred in dairy cows between 3 and 6 years of age. Currently, there is no test to detect the disease in a live animal; veterinary pathologists confirm BSE by postmor tem microscopic examination of brain tissue or by the detection of the abnormal form of the prion protein. BSE is so named because of the spongy appearance of the brain tissue of infected cattle when sections are examined under a microscope.   agent is a virino--a small, noncoding regulatory nucleic acid coated with a host-derived protective protein. The BSE agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization processes. It also does not evoke any detectable immune response or inflammatory reaction in host animals. In cattle naturally infected with BSE, the BSE agent has been found only in brain tissue, in the spinal cord, and in the retina. The distal ileum, bone marrow, dorsal root ganglion, and trigeminal ganglion from experimentally infected cattle were also found to be infective. To date, there has been no evidence of infection detected in milk or muscle tissue. The presence of the BSE agent in tissues is determined by inoculating animals, usually mice, with material believed to be infected with BSE. Mouse inoculation studies take a long time (up to 700 days) to detect the agent, and failure to identify it in tissues may indicate either true absence of the agent or simply the limited sensitivity of current diagnostic methods.  and other organs with potential BSE infectivity. As of Nov. 2, 2001, 114 cases of vCJD had been identified in the United Kingdom, one in Ireland, and five in France. It is impor tant to fur ther clarify the difference between classic CJD and vCJD. Classic CJD occurs each year at a rate of 1 to 2 cases per 1 million people throughout the world, including in the United States and other countries where BSE has never occurred and among vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Classic CJD occurs sporadically (about 90 percent of cases), through iatrogenic transmissions (less than 1 percent) or genetically (about 10 percent). Current evidence suggest that vCJD is a novel condition, clinically and pathologically. The epidemiological evidence is consistent with BSE and the causal agent and recent laboratory evidence provides strong suppor t to the hypothesis of a causal link between BSE and vCJD.  USDA Actions in Response to BSE BSE has not been diagnosed in the United States, and USDA has worked proactively to keep it that way. In cooperation with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), APHIS has taken stringent measures in prevention, education, surveillance, and response. To prevent BSE from entering the country, since 1989 APHIS has prohibited the impor tation of live ruminants from countries where BSE is known to exist in native cattle. Other products derived from ruminants, such as fetal bovine serum, bonemeal, meat-and-bone meal, bloodmeal, offal, fats, and glands, are also prohibited from entry, except under special conditions or under USDA permit for scientific or research purposes. On December 12, 1997, APHIS extended these restrictions to include all of the countries in Europe due to concerns about widespread risk factors and inadequate surveillance for BSE. As of December 7, 2000, USDA prohibited all impor ts of rendered animal protein products, regardless of species, from Europe. This decision followed the recent determination by the European Union that feed of nonruminant origin was potentially cross-contaminated with the BSE agent. The restriction applies to products originating, rendered, processed or otherwise associated with European products. USDA has taken emergency action to prevent potentially cross-contaminated products from entering the United States. The same type of rendered product from ruminant origin has been prohibited from BSEinfected countries since 1989. APHIS educates veterinary practitioners, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians, industry, and producers on the clinical signs and pathology of BSE.  Related Diseases The TSE family of diseases includes scrapie, which affects sheep and goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy; feline spongiform encephalopathy; chronic wasting disease of deer and elk; and in humans, kuru, both classic and variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease, GerstmannStrausslerScheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. TSE's have also been repor ted in captive exotic ruminants, and exotic and domestic cats. The agent isolated from several of these cases is indistinguishable from BSE in cattle suggesting the occurrence of TSE's in these species resulted from BSE-contaminated feed. On March 20, 1996, the United Kingdom's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) announced the identification of 10 cases of variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease. These 10 cases had a characteristic clinical and pathological phenotype which differed from other routinely diagnosed cases of classic (sporadic) CJD in that they are characterized by a younger age at onset of symptoms, have behavioral change symptoms, longer duration of illness, a non-diagnostic or normal EEG tracing, and, under microscopic examination, different lesions in brain tissues. SEAC concluded that, although there was no direct scientific evidence of a link between BSE and vCJD, based on current data and in the absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation at that time was that the cases were linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of a specified bovine offal (SBO) ban at slaughter in 1989. The SBO ban excluded from human consumption brain, spinal cord,   APHIS leads an ongoing, comprehensive, interagency surveillance program for BSE in the United States. BSE is a repor table disease by accredited veterinarians. APHIS veterinary pathologists and field investigators have received training, including training from their British counterpar ts in diagnosing BSE. The surveillance samples include field cases of cattle exhibiting signs of neurological disease, cattle condemned at slaughter for neurologic reasons, rabies-negative cattle submitted to public health laboratories, neurologic cases submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories and teaching hospitals, and sampling of cattle that are nonambulatory (downer cattle/fallen stock). APHIS has also begun to sample adult cattle that die on farms. APHIS' surveillance program is based on laboratories' histopathologically examining brains and using a technique called immunohistochemistry to test brain tissues for the presence of the abnormal prion protein. As of Feb. 4, 2002, more than 21,451 brains from the United States and Puer to Rico have been examined with no evidence of BSE or other TSE detected. APHIS also monitors the remaining cattle impor ted from Great Britain, Belgium, and other European countries (before the bans on impor ts from those countries went into effect). As of Dec. 31, 2000, of the 496 cattle impor ted from Great Britain and Ireland between 1981 and 1989, three animals are still alive. The animals are quarantined and observed regularly. To date, no evidence of BSE or a TSE has been detected. There are five head of cattle from other European countries impor ted between 1986-97 that are still alive and under quarantine. APHIS, in cooperation with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, has also drafted an emergency response plan to be used in the event that BSE is identified in United States. In addition, APHIS' TSE Working Group monitors and assesses all ongoing events and research findings regarding TSE's. APHIS continually revises and adjusts prevention and diagnostic measures as it receives new information and knowledge. As an additional preventative measure, APHIS suppor ts the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation (effective August 4, 1997) prohibiting the use of most mammalian protein (with cer tain exceptions) in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants.

BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a fatal disease that causes progressive neurological degeneration in cattle.  Similar to BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare disease that occurs in humans.  In 1996, following outbreaks of BSE among British cattle, scientists found a possible link between BSE and a new variant of CJD (vCJD).  While it is not certain how BSE may be spread to humans, evidence indicates that humans may acquire vCJD after consuming BSE-contaminated cattle products.     Neither BSE among cattle, nor the new human variant of CJD, have been found in the United States. BSE was first reported among cattle in the United Kingdom (U.K) in November 1986.  The source of the BSE outbreak is uncertain, but it is thought to have been amplified by feeding cattle with meat-and-bone meal from BSE-infected cattle.  To contain the disease, the British government took a number of steps, including the institution of a feed ban prohibiting the use of meat-and-bone meal and slaughtering all cattle believed to be infected. These steps reduced the number of confirmed BSE cases in the U.K. from 36,680 in 1992 to fewer than 1,500 in 2000.   More recently, some cases of BSE have been identified among cattle in other European countries.  Between 1989 and 2000, at least 1,642 cases of BSE have been identified among cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.   Among humans, the total worldwide number of known vCJD cases is 92, including 88 in the U.K., three in France and one in Ireland.   U.S. agencies have acted quickly with precautionary steps to prevent BSE in cattle or vCJD in humans from occurring in this country.  These steps include:      Prohibiting importation of live ruminant animals and most ruminant products from all of Europe (USDA)     Examining U.S. cattle exhibiting abnormal neurological behavior to test for BSE (USDA)    Prohibiting the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminant animals (FDA)    Recommending that animal tissues used in drug products should not come from a country with BSE (FDA)    Issuing guidelines asking blood centers to exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the U.K. between 1980 and 1996 from donating blood (FDA)    Conducting regular surveillance for any cases of vCJD among humans (CDC)    Conducting research on BSE, CJD, vCJD and related neurological diseases (NIH)         BACKGROUND ON BSE AND vCJD    BSE (sometimes referred to as ""mad cow disease"") and variant and classic CJD belong to the unusual group of progressive, degenerative neurological diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These diseases are characterized by a long incubation period of up to several years, during which there is no visible indication of the disease. The incubation period for BSE among cattle ranges from three to eight years; for vCJD among humans, the incubation period is unknown, but is at least five years and could extend up to 20 years or longer. The diseases are invariably fatal; there is no known treatment or cure.    It is believed that vCJD may be acquired from eating food products containing the BSE agent, and there is strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between vCJD and BSE.  The absence of confirmed cases of vCJD in geographic areas free of BSE supports a causal association.  BSE and vCJD have never been identified in the United States.   BSE among cattle was first described in the U.K. in November 1986. Epidemiological evidence established that the outbreak of BSE was related to the production and use over many years of contaminated meat-and-bone meal.  The source of the BSE outbreak is uncertain. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was amplified by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.    The vast majority of BSE cases have been reported in the U.K. Through November 2000, about 177,500 cases of BSE have been confirmed there in more than 35,000 herds of cattle. The U.K. epidemic peaked in January 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Surveillance in Europe has also led to the identification of cases of BSE in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland and, most recently, in Germany, Spain and Italy. From 1995 through early December 2000, 88 human cases of vCJD were reported in the U.K, three in France and one in Ireland.    European countries have instituted a variety of public health control measures, such as BSE surveillance, the culling of sick animals, the banning of specified risk materials (SRMs), or a combination of these, to prevent potentially BSE-infected tissues from entering the human food chain.  Due to its early outbreak, the most stringent of these measures have been applied in the U.K.  In June 2000, the European Union Commission on Food Safety and Animal Welfare adopted a decision requiring all member states to remove SRMs from the animal feed and human food chains as of October 1, 2000; such bans had already been instituted in most member states.    U.S. ACTIONS: STEPS TO MINIMIZE ANY POSSIBLE RISK    No cases of BSE or vCJD have been identified in the United States despite ongoing nationwide surveillance.  Working together, agencies within the federal government have taken a number of steps to minimize the risk of BSE in this country.     HHS Action Plan    In August 2001 HHS unveiled a department-wide action plan outlining new steps to improve scientific understanding of BSE, commonly known as ""mad cow disease,"" and related diseases known as TSEs.  The plan incorporates a comprehensive approach to further strengthen surveillance, increase research resources, and expand existing inspection efforts to prevent BSE and TSEs from entering or taking hold in the United States.   The Secreatary's action plan released today outlines four areas of responsibility-surveillance, protection, research and oversight-within HHS.  This effort will be coordinated with other government agencies, the private sector, and the international community to contain this epidemic and assist those affected by it.  The action plan is on the Web at:  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=01-21145-filed .    Dept. of Agriculture Import/Inspection Protections     The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has responsibilities for both public and animal health. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service operates a substantial program for inspecting animals intended for human consumption. USDA examines all cattle before they can be approved for use as human food; use of cattle with unidentified neurological diseases is prohibited. USDA examines more than 33 million cattle each year.    The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces explicit import regulations covering animals and animal products offered for import into the United States to prevent the importation of foreign exotic diseases such as BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest and African swine fever. In 1989, USDA issued restrictions prohibiting the importation of live ruminants from countries where BSE is known to exist in native cattle. On December 12, 1997, APHIS took further steps to stop the importation of live ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe. As of October 31, 2000, USDA's aggressive BSE monitoring program has examined the brains of more than 11,700 U.S. cattle exhibiting various abnormal behaviors, including neurological symptoms. No evidence of BSE has been found in these U.S. cattle specimens.     HHS Protections     Agencies within HHS have a long-standing commitment to research, epidemiological studies and consumer protection involving BSE and variant and classic CJD.     Cattle Feed Restrictions:  On June 5, 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final regulation that prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep and goats. The regulation also requires process and control systems to ensure that feed for ruminants does not contain the prohibited mammalian tissue. This prohibition is a preventative measure designed to protect animals from potential transmissible degenerative neurological diseases such as BSE and to minimize any potential risk to humans. If a case of BSE were found in the United States, these measures would also help to prevent the spread of BSE through feeds in U.S. cattle. The rule took effect on August 4, 1997.     Protecting the Blood Supply:  In August 1999, FDA issued guidelines to blood centers to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD to recipients of blood products.  This precautionary measure recommended procedures for deferring potential donors who may have been significantly exposed to food and other cattle-derived products in BSE-endemic countries. FDA's present guidelines ask blood centers to exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the U.K. between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1996, from donating blood. Further revision to this guidance may be forthcoming with new information regarding other countries' BSE experiences.  FDA's TSE Advisory Committee recently offered advice on revising the guidelines to include potential donors who have lived an aggregate of 10 years in France, Ireland and Portugal.    Protecting FDA-Regulated Products (including vaccines):  Since 1992, FDA has sent a number of letters to manufacturers of FDA-regulated products providing guidance on the use of bovine materials from countries affected by BSE.   In December 1993 and May 1996, FDA requested that manufacturers of FDA-regulated products intended for humans not use bovine-derived materials from BSE countries. There are some exceptions for products using gelatin produced from bones for oral consumption or cosmetic use if certain precautions are taken.   In April 2000, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) issued a letter to manufacturers reminding them of the agency's strong recommendations not to use materials derived from ruminant animals from countries where BSE is known to exist or may exist.     CBER also asked licensed vaccine manufacturers to evaluate all bovine-sourced material used in vaccines at any stage of manufacturing.  For materials of bovine origin, CBER has asked manufacturers to change the source of such material to BSE-free countries.     FDA inspects all manufacturers of FDA-regulated products on a routine basis to determine if manufacturers are following the agency's current recommendations. In addition, as applications for new products or changes to products are submitted, FDA ensures that the recommendations are being followed.     Research:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has long been actively researching CJD and kuru, a related TSE disease in humans, as well as BSE in animals.    In the 1960s and 1970s, the Nobel Prize-winning team at the NIH Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies conducted experiments on the oral transmission of CJD, kuru, and scrapie, a similar disease that affects sheep and goats.    In the 1980s, scientists at the University of California in San Francisco used extracts of scrapie-infected brains to postulate that the infectious agent was a single protein, PrP. Naming this class of infectious proteins as ""prions,"" scientists showed that prions were a variant of normal proteins. Further research at NIH in the 1990s linked two outbreaks of CJD in Europe and Israel to a genetic mutation in the victims. It is now known that about 10 percent of CJD can be inherited, although it is not known if the genetic defect causes the disease or if another agent, such as a prion, is required.    Today, researchers in the United States and around the world are collaborating in the search for methods to detect, prevent and treat prion-linked diseases. NIH scientists are providing input to the investigation of vCJD cases in Europe and have developed a diagnostic test for the disease that can be performed before death.     Disease Surveillance:   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta conducts surveillance for CJD through examination of death certificate data for U.S. residents. Based on this surveillance, during the period 1979 to 1998, the annual incidence of classic CJD (not the new variant CJD related to BSE) remained stable at approximately one case per million persons.    In addition to the ongoing review of national CJD mortality data, CDC conducted active CJD surveillance in its four established Emerging Infectious Program areas (in Minnesota, Oregon, Connecticut and the San Francisco Bay area) and in a metropolitan Atlanta site during April and May 1996.          In 1996, CDC worked with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to initiate an ongoing follow-up review of clinical and neuropathology records of CJD decedents aged younger than 55 years who are identified through the national mortality data analysis.  This age group is targeted for surveillance because, while classic CJD is normally found in people aged 60 and older, vCJD is generally found in younger individuals.        Also in 1996, the American Association of Neuropathologists, in collaboration with CDC, alerted its members about the new vCJD and requested reports of any possible cases.  These continuing surveillance efforts have not detected evidence of vCJD in the United States.           ###          This is a mirror of the page at   http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2001pres/01fsbse.html         Foods Home    |    FDA Home    |    Search/Subject Index    |    Disclaimers & Privacy Policy    |                                       Accessibility/Help"

BACKGROUND    Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are chronic, fatal diseases affecting the central nervous system of certain species of mammals. TSEs are found in sheep and goats as scrapie; in humans as Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD), new variant CJD, Gerstman-StrausslerScheinker disease, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru; in deer and elk as chronic wasting disease (CWD); in cats as feline spongiform encephalopathy, in mink as transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), and in cattle as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Other cases of TSE have been reported in some exotic ruminants and exotic cats.    BSE was first diagnosed in 1986 in the United Kingdom, and has affect more than 170,000 British cattle. Other countries with confirmed cases of BSE in native cattle include Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, northern Ireland, Portugal, and Switzerland.    The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for protecting both human and animal health and both will be considered in this analysis. Although BSE has not been detected in the United States, the USDA is sponsoring this study to evaluate the current programs to protect the national herd and human health, and to help identify whether further measures are necessary.    OBJECTIVES, TIME FRAME AND DELIVERABLES    There are two objectives to this study, one focused on animal health and one focused on human health.           Assessment potential pathways for entry of transmissible         spongiform agents, including the BSE agent, into U.S.         cattle.       Assess the potential pathways for entry of transmissible         spongiform agents, including the BSE agent, into the U.S.         food supply.      The study will take two years and result in technical reports to the USDA and one or more manuscripts for publication in a scholarly journal.       Opening Comments for BSE Public Meeting, 9/28/98    Dr. Nell Ahl    1.  Welcome to the Public Meeting  to discuss plans for a Risk Analysis for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE.           We appreciate your taking time from your busy lives to         share your ideas about this analysis.       My name is Nell Ahl and I am the Director of the Office         of Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis.       My role is to represent the United States Department of         Agriculture in these discussions and serve as the USDA         Project Manager for this analysis.       2.  BSE is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of cattle , first identified in the UK in 1986.           Since that time, USDA has worked actively to prevent BSE         from entering the U.S. There has been no case of BSE         found in the U.S.        We have taken a number of actions which are listed in the         Chronology, to be found in the meeting packet you         received this morning. The Chronology illustrates the         kinds of efforts made and studies undertaken to keep BSE         out of the U.S.      3. Very recently, scientific studies suggest that  BSE may be linked to a new variant  of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans, perhaps through   consumption of BSE-containing tissues.           Since the USDA is responsible for protecting both human         and animal health and for ensuring the safety and         security of our food supply, we wanted to look         comprehensively at both.       We decided that an outside review of the potential         pathways by which the BSE agent could enter the country         and the human food supply should be performed.       Specifically, we want to look at the effectiveness of         USDA's mitigation measures to block these pathways.      4. On July 1, 1998, USDA  entered into a Cooperative Agreement  with the Harvard University School of Public Health, Center for Risk Analysis to conduct the Risk Analysis and evaluation of USDA programs regarding BSE.           The Risk Analysis is in its early stages.        The purpose of our meeting today is to seek your input         concerning the scope of the Analysis      5.  The goal of this Public Meeting  is to examine the scope of the Risk Analysis, and provide you an opportunity to comment and make suggestions about the issues the analysis should address. Our role is to sit back and listen.           I'm going to turn the meeting over to Dr. George Gray and         his team from the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. They         will give a brief overview of their proposed scope and         approach.       Once Dr. Gray is done, we have an outside facilitator,         Dr. Susan Santos, who will facilitate the rest of the         meeting and help ensure that we provide vou an         opportunitv to comment and make suggestions about the         issues the analvsis should address.      6. The Department's efforts have been  effective in excluding BSE  from the US.           This Risk Analysis is yet another step in our continuing         efforts to assure continued success.       Your input can help make this a better analysis by         bringing your concerns as citizens to the analysts         working on this project.       Our plan is to run this meeting from 9:30 to 12:30. In         addition, you can provide comments via e-mail through         October 16. The address for email comment is shown in the         last page of the public meeting packet.      Closing Comments for BSE Public Meeting    1.  Thank you  for your input into this Risk Analysis. We appreciate your comments.           As I said earlier, comments will be accepted by email         until October 16, 1998, at the email address included in         your meeting packet: < ggray@hsph.harvard.edu >       The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis Team will use your         comments to assure that the scope of their risk analysis         appropriately considers all issues.      2. You may also  visit two USDA websites  which contain more information on BSE.           We intend to post quarterly updates of the progress of         Harvard's BSE Risk Analysis on these sites. The addresses         for these sites are found on the last page of your         meeting packet.      3.  Once again, thank you  for your interest in USDA activities. We remain committed to keeping BSE out of US herds and the US food supply. We appreciate your attendance today to share your knowledge and concerns with us.

GX002-74-4103844	"The backgrounder reproduced below, which originally appeared at  http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/bse.html , has been retired from the FDA Publications collection.  It is no longer being updated.  For the most current information on this topic, please visit the  Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) Hot Topics page .      BSE: Background, Current Concerns, and U.S. Response    March 1, 2001      The recent increase in cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) found in some European countries has revived public concern about the safety of eating beef and using other animal-derived products. The largest increase of this fatal neurological disorder in cattle (commonly called ""mad cow disease"") occurred in France, which reported 99 cases in 2000, compared to 31 cases in 1999. The incidence of BSE-infected cattle is also rising in Belgium and Ireland. Some countries that have not previously seen BSE in their native cattle, including Germany, Spain, Denmark, and Italy, reported their first cases in 2000.    First identified in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1986, BSE peaked in the UK in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. The UK has reported more than 180,000 total cases of BSE, and about 1,800 cases have been found elsewhere in the European Union (EU).     Because of the UK's aggressive actions to eradicate BSE since it was first identified, the number of BSE cases is falling sharply in that country. The sudden rise in reported BSE cases in other European countries may, in part, reflect increased testing by some countries, particularly Switzerland and France. In addition, because of the long incubation period of BSE (two to eight years), cows being identified now with BSE may have become infected several years ago.    Rendered feed ingredients contaminated with an infectious agent are believed to be the source of BSE infection in cattle. Some of the feed given to cattle includes ingredients processed from remnants of slaughtered animals, such as meat-and-bone meal (MBM), which may harbor the agent that causes BSE. Although the material is cooked, the BSE agent can survive.     BSE may have originated from giving cows feed that contained MBM derived from sheep infected with scrapie (an infectious neurological disease in sheep and goats, similar to BSE in cows). There is strong evidence, and general agreement, that the original outbreak of BSE in Europe was amplified by feeding MBM prepared from BSE-infected cattle to young calves.     No cases of disease in humans or livestock caused by BSE have ever been detected in the United States. BSE has thus far been kept out of this country largely through the combined efforts of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), other federal organizations, and state regulatory and health agencies. These organizations have taken aggressive actions to reduce the risk that BSE could be introduced and spread in this country. These actions build on a continuing program of prevention, education, surveillance, testing, and emergency preparation.     BSE in Cattle Linked to Disease in People    In 1996, British scientists traced a link between a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare but fatal disease in humans, and BSE in cattle. Both the new variant CJD and the classic CJD are slow degenerative diseases of the central nervous system whose symptoms include dementia and loss of motor skills. There is no known treatment and the outcome is ultimately death. Only the new variant-not the classic-CJD is believed to be caused by exposure to the BSE agent, most likely through certain foods.     CJD and the new variant CJD (nvCJD) belong to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These diseases, so named because of the spongy appearance of the infected brain tissue, are caused by a transmissible agent that is not yet fully understood. In addition to nvCJD and CJD, three other human TSEs are known, including kuru, which was first recorded in 1957 in the Fore natives of the New Guinea highlands.     Classic CJD occurs sporadically worldwide at a rate of approximately one case per 1 million people per year, and the new variant CJD and other human TSEs are even more rare.    In addition to BSE, other TSEs have been detected in some species of animals (sheep, goats, mink, deer, elk, and domestic and exotic cats). Most TSEs-with the exception of nvCJD-are species-specific, with no evidence of natural transmission between animals and people.     On March 20, 1996, the UK reported 10 cases of nvCJD. As of Feb. 2, 2001, 98 cases of nvCJD have been suspected or confirmed in the EU. With the exception of three cases in France and one case in Ireland, all have occurred in the UK.     Patients who have acquired nvCJD have been younger and have had the disease longer than patients with classic CJD. (The average age for death from nvCJD has been 27.5 versus 68 in CJD, and the average time to death after the onset of clinical symptoms is 13 months for nvCJD versus less than six months for CJD.)     Britain's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) has reported that the BSE agent is the likely cause of the nvCJD. This conclusion was based on studies conducted at the Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh, Scotland, the Imperial College School of Medicine, London, and the University of California in San Francisco.     No cases of nvCJD have been detected in the United States through CDC's surveillance program. In fact, no illnesses in livestock or humans caused by BSE have ever been diagnosed in the United States, despite 10 years of active surveillance.     Transmission and Testing    Current research suggests the agent that causes BSE and other TSEs is a ""prion,"" an abnormal protein with a novel mode of replication and transmission. Cattle may contract the disease from feed containing animal byproducts contaminated with this protein.     The BSE agent is highly resistant to most disinfectants that normally inactivate viruses or bacteria, such as heat, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation. BSE agents do not appear to stimulate an immune response, and so, as yet, cannot be detected with a blood test for antibodies or prevented with a vaccine.    No evidence exists to indicate that BSE spreads through routine contact between cattle or from routine contact between cattle and humans or other species. Some evidence suggests that transmission from mother to fetus may occur at a low level, but this conclusion has not been confirmed. Recent studies have shown that certain healthy animals can get BSE from injections of blood from a BSE-infected animal. F. Houston and Nora Hunter of the Institute For Animal Health, Compton, Newbury, UK, and Edinburgh, UK, reported successful BSE transmission to a healthy sheep that received 400 milliliters of blood from a donor sheep infected with BSE (Lancet, September 2000).    Currently, no test can readily detect BSE in a live animal or detect TSEs in healthy humans. The main laboratory method used to confirm a diagnosis is to examine brain tissue after death. Researchers are working to develop new test methods to detect TSEs in live animals and humans.     The U.S. Response     The United States has aggressive BSE surveillance and prevention programs in place. FDA's restrictions on certain animal feed ingredients and its import alerts on cattle products are a critical part of this program. In addition, USDA has an import ban on certain cattle and cattle products, and CDC has established surveillance and investigation programs for suspected human TSE cases.    USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) introduced import restrictions in 1989, when it banned the import of all live ruminants (cud-chewing animals, such as cows, sheep, and goats) from the UK.    On Dec. 12, 1997, APHIS expanded its prohibition on certain imports to include live ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe.    USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) inspects cattle before they go to slaughter if they show signs of BSE or other central nervous system impairment. Any animals displaying these signs are condemned, and the meat is not allowed to be used in human food. The animal brains are submitted to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for analysis. Approximately 12,000 cattle brains from nearly every state and Puerto Rico have been examined, with no evidence of BSE or other TSE found to date.     FDA is responsible for ensuring that animal feeds are safe and produce no human health hazards when used in food-producing animals. On June 5, 1997, FDA published a final regulation that prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminants. The regulation, which became effective on Aug. 4, 1997, also requires manufacturers to use appropriate process and control systems to ensure that feed for ruminants does not contain the prohibited mammalian tissue.     To ensure that industry was complying with the animal feed regulation, FDA, with assistance from state feed control officials, has conducted nearly 10,000 inspections since January 1998. Inspected firms include feed mills, ruminant feeders, dairy farms, renderers, protein blenders, feed haulers, and distributors. More than three-fourths of all of the inspected facilities were found to be in compliance with the regulation, and nearly 85 percent of the 180 renderers handling prohibited materials were in compliance. The compliance of rendering plants is particularly important because they are the source of most domestic MBM. Sites initially found not to be in compliance have shown a high percentage of compliance upon re-inspection.    Using an innovative, education-oriented partnership program, FDA continues to enforce its 1997 feed regulation. FDA has sponsored workshops for state veterinarians and feed control officials from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. In addition, a joint satellite teleconference with the Association of American Feed Control Officials, the American Feed Industry Association, and the National Grain and Feed Association was broadcast in 1998 throughout the United States and Canada to describe the requirements of the regulations and answer questions from callers. FDA has also developed an interactive CD-ROM that provides information on the regulation and what is expected of those to whom the regulation applies. The CD-ROM is available to FDA, the states, and the regulated industry.    To continue its comprehensive efforts to try to head off a BSE problem in the United States, FDA is conducting additional inspections, and is re-inspecting facilities that were found non-compliant upon initial inspection. Based on the evaluation of the inspections conducted from 1998 through 2000, FDA will revise its compliance strategy to try to assure its goal of 100 percent compliance with the feed regulation.    FDA and USDA recently took further emergency action to prevent potentially cross-contaminated products from entering the United States. On Dec. 7, 2000, APHIS banned all imports of rendered animal proteins, regardless of species, from 31 countries listed as BSE-positive or as presenting an undue risk of introducing BSE into the United States. Prohibited products include MBM, meat meal, bone meal, blood meal, tankage (dried animal residues), and offal (organs, such as brain and liver, and trimmings, such as tails and hooves). FDA has also announced an import alert, allowing its inspectors to detain shipments from these 31 countries of animal feed (including pet food), animal feed ingredients, and other products of animal origin intended for human or animal use.     Protecting Medical Products    In addition to protecting the American cattle herd from BSE, FDA also has taken steps to protect medical products (such as drugs, blood, vaccines, and medical devices) for human use. In 1990, FDA intensified its review of new product applications for human medical products derived from or containing bovine (cattle) sources. FDA recommended to manufacturers of these new products that they not purchase as components animal tissues or products that originated in a country where native cattle have been diagnosed with BSE.     In 1993, and again in 1996, FDA issued letters to the manufacturers of drugs, biologics and medical devices advising them that in the manufacture of FDA-regulated products intended for human use, they should not use materials derived from cattle born, raised or slaughtered in countries where BSE is known to exist. Again in 2000, FDA reissued the same advice to vaccine and other biological manufacturers regarding bovine materials from countries listed by APHIS as having BSE or with an undue risk of introducing BSE into the United States.      FDA will continue its close collaboration with the scientific community and with public health officials, at home and abroad, to take the appropriate preventive actions in response to the growing and changing knowledge concerning TSEs in its ongoing effort to protect the health of Americans and of U.S. cattle herds.

BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a fatal disease that causes progressive neurological degeneration in cattle.  Similar to BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare disease that occurs in humans.  In 1996, following outbreaks of BSE among British cattle, scientists found a possible link between BSE and a new variant of CJD (vCJD).  While it is not certain how BSE may be spread to humans, evidence indicates that humans may acquire vCJD after consuming BSE-contaminated cattle products.     Neither BSE among cattle, nor the new human variant of CJD, have been found in the United States. BSE was first reported among cattle in the United Kingdom (U.K) in November 1986.  The source of the BSE outbreak is uncertain, but it is thought to have been amplified by feeding cattle with meat-and-bone meal from BSE-infected cattle.  To contain the disease, the British government took a number of steps, including the institution of a feed ban prohibiting the use of meat-and-bone meal and slaughtering all cattle believed to be infected. These steps reduced the number of confirmed BSE cases in the U.K. from 36,680 in 1992 to fewer than 1,500 in 2000.   More recently, some cases of BSE have been identified among cattle in other European countries.  Between 1989 and 2000, at least 1,642 cases of BSE have been identified among cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.   Among humans, the total worldwide number of known vCJD cases is 92, including 88 in the U.K., three in France and one in Ireland.   U.S. agencies have acted quickly with precautionary steps to prevent BSE in cattle or vCJD in humans from occurring in this country.  These steps include:      Prohibiting importation of live ruminant animals and most ruminant products from all of Europe (USDA)     Examining U.S. cattle exhibiting abnormal neurological behavior to test for BSE (USDA)    Prohibiting the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminant animals (FDA)    Recommending that animal tissues used in drug products should not come from a country with BSE (FDA)    Issuing guidelines asking blood centers to exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the U.K. between 1980 and 1996 from donating blood (FDA)    Conducting regular surveillance for any cases of vCJD among humans (CDC)    Conducting research on BSE, CJD, vCJD and related neurological diseases (NIH)        BACKGROUND ON BSE AND vCJD    BSE (sometimes referred to as ""mad cow disease"") and variant and classic CJD belong to the unusual group of progressive, degenerative neurological diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). These diseases are characterized by a long incubation period of up to several years, during which there is no visible indication of the disease. The incubation period for BSE among cattle ranges from three to eight years; for vCJD among humans, the incubation period is unknown, but is at least five years and could extend up to 20 years or longer. The diseases are invariably fatal; there is no known treatment or cure.    It is believed that vCJD may be acquired from eating food products containing the BSE agent, and there is strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between vCJD and BSE.  The absence of confirmed cases of vCJD in geographic areas free of BSE supports a causal association.  BSE and vCJD have never been identified in the United States.   BSE among cattle was first described in the U.K. in November 1986. Epidemiological evidence established that the outbreak of BSE was related to the production and use over many years of contaminated meat-and-bone meal.  The source of the BSE outbreak is uncertain. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was amplified by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.    The vast majority of BSE cases have been reported in the U.K. Through November 2000, about 177,500 cases of BSE have been confirmed there in more than 35,000 herds of cattle. The U.K. epidemic peaked in January 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Surveillance in Europe has also led to the identification of cases of BSE in Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland and, most recently, in Germany, Spain and Italy. From 1995 through early December 2000, 88 human cases of vCJD were reported in the U.K, three in France and one in Ireland.    European countries have instituted a variety of public health control measures, such as BSE surveillance, the culling of sick animals, the banning of specified risk materials (SRMs), or a combination of these, to prevent potentially BSE-infected tissues from entering the human food chain.  Due to its early outbreak, the most stringent of these measures have been applied in the U.K.  In June 2000, the European Union Commission on Food Safety and Animal Welfare adopted a decision requiring all member states to remove SRMs from the animal feed and human food chains as of October 1, 2000; such bans had already been instituted in most member states.    U.S. ACTIONS: STEPS TO MINIMIZE ANY POSSIBLE RISK    No cases of BSE or vCJD have been identified in the United States despite ongoing nationwide surveillance.  Working together, agencies within the federal government have taken a number of steps to minimize the risk of BSE in this country.     HHS Action Plan    In August 2001 HHS unveiled a department-wide action plan outlining new steps to improve scientific understanding of BSE, commonly known as ""mad cow disease,"" and related diseases known as TSEs.  The plan incorporates a comprehensive approach to further strengthen surveillance, increase research resources, and expand existing inspection efforts to prevent BSE and TSEs from entering or taking hold in the United States.   The Secreatary's action plan released today outlines four areas of responsibility-surveillance, protection, research and oversight-within HHS.  This effort will be coordinated with other government agencies, the private sector, and the international community to contain this epidemic and assist those affected by it.  The action plan is on the Web at:  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=01-21145-filed .    Dept. of Agriculture Import/Inspection Protections     The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has responsibilities for both public and animal health. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service operates a substantial program for inspecting animals intended for human consumption. USDA examines all cattle before they can be approved for use as human food; use of cattle with unidentified neurological diseases is prohibited. USDA examines more than 33 million cattle each year.    The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces explicit import regulations covering animals and animal products offered for import into the United States to prevent the importation of foreign exotic diseases such as BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest and African swine fever. In 1989, USDA issued restrictions prohibiting the importation of live ruminants from countries where BSE is known to exist in native cattle. On December 12, 1997, APHIS took further steps to stop the importation of live ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe. As of October 31, 2000, USDA's aggressive BSE monitoring program has examined the brains of more than 11,700 U.S. cattle exhibiting various abnormal behaviors, including neurological symptoms. No evidence of BSE has been found in these U.S. cattle specimens.     HHS Protections     Agencies within HHS have a long-standing commitment to research, epidemiological studies and consumer protection involving BSE and variant and classic CJD.     Cattle Feed Restrictions:  On June 5, 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final regulation that prohibits the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feeds given to ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep and goats. The regulation also requires process and control systems to ensure that feed for ruminants does not contain the prohibited mammalian tissue. This prohibition is a preventative measure designed to protect animals from potential transmissible degenerative neurological diseases such as BSE and to minimize any potential risk to humans. If a case of BSE were found in the United States, these measures would also help to prevent the spread of BSE through feeds in U.S. cattle. The rule took effect on August 4, 1997.     Protecting the Blood Supply:  In August 1999, FDA issued guidelines to blood centers to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD to recipients of blood products.  This precautionary measure recommended procedures for deferring potential donors who may have been significantly exposed to food and other cattle-derived products in BSE-endemic countries. FDA's present guidelines ask blood centers to exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the U.K. between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1996, from donating blood. Further revision to this guidance may be forthcoming with new information regarding other countries' BSE experiences.  FDA's TSE Advisory Committee recently offered advice on revising the guidelines to include potential donors who have lived an aggregate of 10 years in France, Ireland and Portugal.    Protecting FDA-Regulated Products (including vaccines):  Since 1992, FDA has sent a number of letters to manufacturers of FDA-regulated products providing guidance on the use of bovine materials from countries affected by BSE.   In December 1993 and May 1996, FDA requested that manufacturers of FDA-regulated products intended for humans not use bovine-derived materials from BSE countries. There are some exceptions for products using gelatin produced from bones for oral consumption or cosmetic use if certain precautions are taken.   In April 2000, FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) issued a letter to manufacturers reminding them of the agency's strong recommendations not to use materials derived from ruminant animals from countries where BSE is known to exist or may exist.     CBER also asked licensed vaccine manufacturers to evaluate all bovine-sourced material used in vaccines at any stage of manufacturing.  For materials of bovine origin, CBER has asked manufacturers to change the source of such material to BSE-free countries.     FDA inspects all manufacturers of FDA-regulated products on a routine basis to determine if manufacturers are following the agency's current recommendations. In addition, as applications for new products or changes to products are submitted, FDA ensures that the recommendations are being followed.     Research:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has long been actively researching CJD and kuru, a related TSE disease in humans, as well as BSE in animals.    In the 1960s and 1970s, the Nobel Prize-winning team at the NIH Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies conducted experiments on the oral transmission of CJD, kuru, and scrapie, a similar disease that affects sheep and goats.    In the 1980s, scientists at the University of California in San Francisco used extracts of scrapie-infected brains to postulate that the infectious agent was a single protein, PrP. Naming this class of infectious proteins as ""prions,"" scientists showed that prions were a variant of normal proteins. Further research at NIH in the 1990s linked two outbreaks of CJD in Europe and Israel to a genetic mutation in the victims. It is now known that about 10 percent of CJD can be inherited, although it is not known if the genetic defect causes the disease or if another agent, such as a prion, is required.    Today, researchers in the United States and around the world are collaborating in the search for methods to detect, prevent and treat prion-linked diseases. NIH scientists are providing input to the investigation of vCJD cases in Europe and have developed a diagnostic test for the disease that can be performed before death.     Disease Surveillance:   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta conducts surveillance for CJD through examination of death certificate data for U.S. residents. Based on this surveillance, during the period 1979 to 1998, the annual incidence of classic CJD (not the new variant CJD related to BSE) remained stable at approximately one case per million persons.    In addition to the ongoing review of national CJD mortality data, CDC conducted active CJD surveillance in its four established Emerging Infectious Program areas (in Minnesota, Oregon, Connecticut and the San Francisco Bay area) and in a metropolitan Atlanta site during April and May 1996.      In 1996, CDC worked with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to initiate an ongoing follow-up review of clinical and neuropathology records of CJD decedents aged younger than 55 years who are identified through the national mortality data analysis.  This age group is targeted for surveillance because, while classic CJD is normally found in people aged 60 and older, vCJD is generally found in younger individuals.    Also in 1996, the American Association of Neuropathologists, in collaboration with CDC, alerted its members about the new vCJD and requested reports of any possible cases.  These continuing surveillance efforts have not detected evidence of vCJD in the United States.         ###      Note:  All HHS press releases, fact sheets and other press materials are available at  http://www.hhs.gov/news .

GX231-32-1006400	"Key Facts November 2001  Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) What is BSE? Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as ""mad cow disease,"" is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder of cattle. Worldwide, there have been more than 180,000 cases of BSE since the disease was first diagnosed in 1986 in the United Kingdom (UK). The disease has also been found in native-born cattle in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Por tugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. However, more than 95% of all BSE cases have occurred in the United Kingdom. No confirmed cases of BSE have been found in the United States despite more than 10 years of active surveillance. BSE belongs to a family of diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). TSEs share some common characteristics including a prolonged incubation period ranging from a few months to years and progressively debilitatingneurological illnesses, which are always fatal. Examples of other TSEs include scrapie (sheep and goats), chronic wasting disease (deer and elk), feline spongiform encephalopathy (cats), kuru (humans), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) (humans). TSEs are caused by a transmissible agent that is not yet fully understood. The agent responsible for BSE is smaller than the smallest known virus and has not been completely characterized. There are three main theories on the nature of the agent: (1) the agent is a virus with unusual characteristics; (2) the agent is a prion  an exclusively hostcoded protein that is modified to a par tially protease-resistant form after infection; and (3) the agent is a virino  a small, noncoding regulator y nucleic acid coated with a host-derived protective protein. The BSE agent is extremely resistant to heat and to normal sterilization processes. It also does not evoke any detectable immune response or inflammator y reaction in host animals. Epidemiological data suggest that the outbreak of BSE was caused by a common source material, involving animal feed containing contaminated meat-and-bone meal as a protein source. The disease in Great Britain may have been caused by feeding cattle rendered protein produced either from the carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep or from cattle with a previously unidentified TSE. Changes in rendering operations in the early 1980s may have permitted an infectious TSE agent to survive the rendering process. The resulting contaminated meat-and-bone meal could then have been fed to cattle, eventually resulting in the epidemic. Currently, there is no test to detect TSEs in a live animal. Veterinar y pathologists confirm BSE by postmor tem microscopic examination of brain tissue or by the detection of the abnormal form of the prion protein using supplemental tests described below. BSE is so named because of the spongy appearance of the brain tissue of affected cattle when sections are examined under a microscope. Supplemental tests are available to enhance the diagnostic capabilities for TSEs. Research shows a par tially protease-resistant form of the prion protein is found in the brain of TSE-infected animals. Two tests that have been used routinely to detect the abnor mal prion protein in animals showing clinical signs of a TSE are immunohistochemistry and a Western-blot technique. These tests permit diagnosis of a TSE based on finding prion proteins even if the brain has been frozen or if tissue breakdown has occurred. The presence of the TSE agent in tissues is generally determined by injecting animals, usually mice, with material believed to be infected with the TSE, then obser ving the mice to see if they die and have   characteristic lesions in the brain. Mouse inoculation studies take a long time (up to 700 days) to detect the agent. Since this method may take more than 2 years, it is not considered practical for routine testing. To date there has been no evidence of infectivity detected in milk or muscle tissue.  The disease vCJD is most likely caused by the ingestion of products contaminated with the BSE agent. As of November 2, 2001, 111 cases of vCJD have been suspected or confirmed in the UK. There have also been four cases in France and one case in Ireland. Patients with vCJD have primarily been younger and exhibit clinical signs of the disease longer than patients with classic CJD. The median age of death of persons afflicted with vCJD is 28 years  compared to 68 years for CJD. The average time between the onset of clinical symptoms and death is 13 months for vCJD and less than 6 months for CJD.  BSE: Implications for Cattle Cattle affected with BSE experience progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Affected animals may display changes in temperament, such as ner vousness or aggression, abnormal posture, lack of coordination and difficulty in rising, decreased milk production, and loss of body weight despite a normal appetite. The disease is always fatal. Currently, there is neither a treatment for the disease nor a vaccine to prevent it. The incubation period typically (the time from when an animal becomes exposed until it first shows signs of disease) is from 2 to 8 years. Following the onset of clinical signs, the animal's condition deteriorates until it either dies or is destroyed. This usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months. Most cases in the United Kingdom have occurred in dair y cows between 3 and 6 years of age. There is no evidence that BSE spreads by contact between unrelated adult cattle or from cattle to other animal species. However, some evidence suggests that mater nal transmission may occur at an extremely low level. This low level would not be sufficient to sustain the epidemic in the UK if it occurs at all.  BSE: Implications for Humans BSE is a disease that affects cattle. However, other TSEs affect humans. The most commonly identified TSE in humans is classic (sporadic) CreutzfeldtJakob Disease. Classic CJD occurs sporadically at a rate of approximately one case per one million people per year, worldwide. Scientific evidence (epidemiological and laborator y) suppor ts a causal relationship between BSE outbreaks in Europe and another TSE disease in humans, called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).   For More Information For questions concerning BSE, BSE surveillance, and agricultural import bans, contact APHIS Media Inquiries: (301) 734-7799 Technical Inquiries: (609) 259-5825 APHIS Web site: www.aphis.usda.gov For questions concerning food safety, AMR, or MSM, contact FSIS Media Inquiries: (202) 720-9113 Technical Inquiries: (202) 690-6566 Consumer Inquiries: Call USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555.

It belongs to the pox group of viruses which produce rabbit fibromatosis, rabbit myxomatosis, hare fibromatosis and some deer fibromas. Multiple skin tumors on gray squirrels from Maryland were reported in 1953. Since then, reports of squirrels with skin tumors have come from Florida, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, and Ontario. In Michigan, they have been found on both gray and fox squirrels in the lower peninsula.         Transmission and Development         These tumors are presumably all caused by a virus. Although the natural history of the virus is not known, both  Aedes   aegypti  and  Anopheles   quadrimaculatus  mosquitoes have transmitted it from squirrel to squirrel in the laboratory. It is probably transmitted by insects in nature as well.         The tumors develop at the site where the insects feed on the animal.         Clinical Signs and Pathology         Naturally infected squirrels are mostly juveniles. The tumors may be scattered over all the body and range in size from a few mm to 25mm in diameter. Metastasis to the lungs, liver, kidney, and lymph nodes has been reported. In general, there are no obvious signs of illness in naturally infected squirrels except for the presence of the tumors over the skin. In severe cases, when vision is obstructed or the skin becomes secondarily infected, the animal may be less active, weak, and eventually die. The microscopic lesions of squirrel pox virus in the gray squirrel are similar to those reported from Shope's rabbit fibroma virus in the cottontail.         Diagnosis         The disease is diagnosed by finding characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. Confirmation of the disease is either by histologic examination of tissues for intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies or by virus isolation.         Treatment and Control         There is no known treatment; presumably a vaccine could be developed. However, it would not be logistically or economically feasible to treat free-living wild animals. In cases where the disease is not severe, the lesions probably regress and the animal recovers completely.         Significance         As far as we know, the virus only infects squirrels in nature. However, in the laboratory it has been successfully transmitted to woodchucks and rabbits.         In Michigan, where squirrel pox is common, there apparently have been no noticeable effects on squirrel populations. The disease is of no public health significance. The carcasses of affected animals are safe for human consumption, since current knowledge indicates the virus is not transmissible to man. Furthermore, the tumors are confined to the skin and are removed when the animal is skinned.           Return to Index      For questions about wildlife diseases, please contact the  Rose Lake Wildlife Disease Laboratory .

To achieve these high titers, the most immunogenic contraceptive                      proteins must be combined with the best possible adjuvant.                      Previously, the only adjuvant that has consistently provided                      high and long-lasting immunocontraceptive responses has been                      Freund’s adjuvant. The killed bacteria in Freund’s                      recruits immune cells to the site and the presence of a vaccine/mineral                      oil emulsion promotes the antigen response by slowing the                      degradation of the vaccine. NWRC has been using a modified                      Freund’s, produced by Calbiochem, which substitutes M.                      butyricum for M. tuberculosis. This substitution reduces the                      problem of a false positive TB skin test in the immunized                      animal.                      NWRC scientists have developed a new KLH-GnRH                      conjugate design which in conjunction with the a new adjuvant,                      a modification of the currently licensed Johne’s disease                      vaccine containing M. avium, has allowed us to develop a single                      shot GnRH vaccine in deer. All previous contraceptive vaccines                      required at least 2 injections called a prime dose and a boost                      dose. This single shot technology is being tested at Penn                      State University where the results for the first year have                      been quite promising. The deer will be monitored 3 or more                      years to determine if the contraceptive effects will be multi-year.                      We will be field testing this new single shot GnRH vaccine                      under the FDA issued INAD 10006. NWRC is in the process of                      a patent application for the newly designed GnRH/AdjuVac vaccine.                                           A Trial of GnRH                      Vaccination in a San Francisco Bay Area Population of California                      Ground Squirrels                                                                                           California                          ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) cause                          numerous problems in California parks. The squirrels have                          been known to bite park visitors and steal food from picnics.                          They dig burrows under buildings, sidewalks and trees,                          causing structural damage. Burrow entrances are at ground                          level and are sometimes difficult to see. The open holes                          are hazardous for joggers, walkers and others.                                                               Though ground squirrels                      cause conflicts with humans in the park environments, there                      are limited options for their control. Relocation is not feasible                      and poisoning in the area of the park is prohibited by law.                      Contraception would be a valuable tool in this type of situation.                      And while oral administration of a contraceptive agent would                      be preferable for ease of administration, an injected vaccine                      is currently the most thoroughly tested contraceptive method.                     After hearing about                      NWRC’s GnRH contraceptive vaccine technology, three                      California agencies approached NWRC regarding a possible collaborative                      effort to test the vaccine in California ground squirrels                      at a park in the San Francisco Bay area. Thus, a multi-year                      study on the efficacy and feasibility of gonadotropin releasing                      hormone (GnRH) immunization for population control of California                      ground squirrels was begun in the summer of 2001. Baseline                      visual counts were performed in early summer 2001 after young                      emerged from burrows.                      The immunization                      process was initiated at the end of the summer and in early                      fall. Animals were trapped for ear-tagging, vaccine injecting,                      sexing, and marking with hair dye. (Fleas falling off the                      squirrels were also collected for identification.) The squirrels                      were readily trapped; the first 92 squirrels were injected                      in two days and some additional squirrels were released without                      treatment after all the vaccine on site was used.                     NWRC's collaborators                      in California continued to inject squirrels through 2002.                      More than 180 squirrels in the park have been immunized. A                      comparison of lactation in immunized and unimmunized females                      in the park during the spring of 2002 suggested reproductive                      inhibition of over 90%.                                              Visual counts taken in 2001 were repeated in the same                      manner in 2002 and will be repeated in year three to determine                      the overall effect of the vaccination effort.                                                                                                                       Home                       |  Research Programs  |  PD                      Research  |  GnRH  | Single Shot
GX100-89-9968256	TEKTRAN   MINERAL DEFICIENCY, ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MALFORMED FROGS IN MINNESOTA.      Author(s):    GARBER  ERIC                       ERB  JUDITH L                      MCGARVEY  AMY M                    LARSEN  GERALD L                   MAGNER  JOSEPH                           Interpretive Summary:    Amphibian populations around the world have been declining at an alarming   rate for several decades. Despite this global decline the incidence of      malformed frogs in Minnesota was estimated at only 0.2% prior to the mid-   1990s.  Between 1995 and 1997 over 62% of the counties in Minnesota         reported the presence of deformed frogs.  Surveys conducted across the      state of Minnesota since 1996 examined 13,763 northern leopard frogs (Rana  pipiens) and found 900 malformed frogs, 6.5%.  The widespread occurrence of malformed frogs and the importance of fresh water to the food chain has     increased public concern regarding food safety and public health. In this   study, we used the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay: Xenopus (FETAX)         bioassay to screen water samples collected from various wetlands for        compounds that affect development and study the role of minerals in the     occurrence of malformed frogs in Minnesota. The presence of phthalates and  the pesticide content of the water samples were examined by GC/MS.  In      addition, ubiquitous estradiol was measured using commercial enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.  These results along with biosensor       studies are consistent with a model in which hydrological events during the mid 1990s may have helped induce frog malformations.  We found a decrease   in either sodium or potassium content to less than 2ppm retarded tadpole    development and could have altered the windows of susceptibility towards    infection or the action of a biologically active compound (i.e.: endocrine  disruptors).

Author(s):    GARBER  ERIC                       ERB  JUDITH L                      MAGNER  JOSEPH                     LARSEN  GERALD L                         Interpretive Summary:    Between 1995 and 1997 over 62% of the counties in Minnesota reported the    presence of malformed frogs. In August 2000 a site (HIB) was discovered in  northeastern Minnesota in which > 68% of the first year Rana pipiens        (northern leopard frogs) were deformed.  Water samples were collected in    1999 and 2000 from lakes in Minnesota containing malformed frogs as part of an effort to study the presence of toxins in fresh water sources that may   affect frog development and cause malformations.  The water samples were    screened for the presence of toxins using the FETAX assay in which frog     embryo development is monitored during the first 96 hours when (or as)      organs are formed.  Water, from two of the lakes, severely delayed embryo   development.  Inasmuch as low concentrations of potassium have been linked  to retarded frog growth, samples were analyzed for the presence of 14       minerals and the effects of mineral supplementation were also examined.     These results confirmed the importance of potassium and demonstrated that   low sodium was the cause of retarded development at one site. Seasonal      fluctuations were also examined and correlated with changes in potassium    and sodium levels dependent on the site. A relationship is proposed between retarded frog development in lakes lacking sufficient critical minerals and the effects of compounds which inhibit hormonally regulated development     (endocrine disruptors).

GX046-66-5664305	"Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 105, Number 10, October 1997                                        Frog Deformities Research Not Leaping to Conclusions                Wading through Questions about Aquatic Toxins                           Frog Deformities Research Not Leaping to Conclusions            Since 1989, evidence has been mounting of a global decline in the numbers of certain species of amphibians. Three years ago, biologists in Minnesota discovered a different problem in the amphibian community--large numbers of frogs with missing or deformed limbs. Subsequent research indicates the problem is widespread, including large areas of Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, Vermont, and parts of Ontario and Quebec. Determined to track down the cause of these deformities, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), based in St. Paul, has called on the NIEHS to collaborate on a research effort.                                                    Unhoppy frogs            . Extra limbs are some of the deformities showing up in frogs in Minnesota, the cause of which is still unknown.                 The first hint of trouble among frogs came in 1993, when a group of schoolchildren discovered frogs with malformed and missing limbs in a Minnesota farm pond, and posted their findings on the Internet. During the following two years, reports of deformities increased but were restricted to a few localities and one species, the northern leopard frog (         Rana pipiens        ). In 1996, the number of reports and species involved increased tremendously. Six species of deformed frogs have been documented by the MPCA at more than 150 sites across 54 counties in Minnesota. The malformations found include missing or additional feet, legs, toes, and eyes, as well as musculoskeletal and urogenital defects. The incidence of abnormalities was as high as 60% among some frog populations. Abnormalities are rare among natural and laboratory-reared frogs--less than 0.05%. Thus, biologists have little doubt they are witnessing a genuine phenomenon.        Starting in late 1996, workshops were held by various government agencies to postulate mechanisms that could result in the deformities, review possible environmental causes, and identify research needs. Participants agreed that a national reporting center was needed to encourage standardization of the data being collected by federal, state, and university research groups. The National Reporting Center for Amphibian Malformities (NARCAM) has subsequently been established at the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown, North Dakota, which has an Internet site located at               http://www.npsc.nbs.gov/narcam        .        Scientists have advanced a number of theories to explain the deformities. Prime suspects include chemical contamination, increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to ozone depletion, parasitic infestation, or some combination of the three. Frogs spend a major portion of their lives in water, and thus may be particularly vulnerable to ill effects stemming from chemical contamination of water. Many of the sites in which deformed frogs have been discovered are close to agricultural fields that are intensively sprayed with pesticides and herbicides at certain times of the year. It has been suggested that one or more of the chemicals used, acting alone or in combination with other agents such as UV light, might be disrupting normal frog development.        ""There are several prominent cases in this country in which chemical agents were known to cause gross anatomical deformities in wildlife,"" says Tim Kubiak, national water quality coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ""In the western United States, high levels of selenium leaching into surface water caused defects in the eggs of shorebirds and fish. And in the Great Lakes, dioxin and dioxin-related chemicals are suspected of causing crossed bills among fish-eating birds. So there is certainly reason to explore a chemical connection with the frog deformities.""        Stanley Sessions, a biology professor at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, has argued that a class of parasitic flatworms known as trematodes may be responsible for the deformities. Trematodes living in aquatic environments can induce deformities by boring into the skin of larval amphibians and causing cysts near the developing hind limbs. These cysts are hypothesized to disrupt normal development. However, parasitology information indicates that amphibians and parasites have long coexisted in equilibrium and that parasite populations tend to be very stable. Also, in recent testing, water samples from several sites where deformed frogs have been found from which all parasites had been removed still produced abnormalities in frogs.                                                           Jim Burkhart                     Photo credit: Steve McCaw, Image Associates, Inc.                                 As of yet, there are insufficient data to establish any correlation between chemical contamination, or any other cause, and the incidence of abnormality. In the spring of 1997, the MPCA requested help from the NIEHS to establish a collaborative research effort to tease out associations between chemical exposures and malformations, to demonstrate similar effects under controlled laboratory experiments, and to identify the mechanisms by which the deformities are occurring. Jim Burkhart, head of the Alternative Systems Group within the NIEHS's Environmental Toxicology Program, is coordinating this effort. Researchers from the EPA, the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, the U.S. Geological Survey's Environmental and Contaminants Research Center in Columbia, Missouri, and the University of Minnesota are also participating.        ""We [the NIEHS] have a very broad base of scientific expertise that can be brought to bear on this issue, including environmental chemistry, different laboratory models, retinoid receptor models, and endocrine disrupter models,"" Burkhart says. ""Our role is to determine cause and effect, and any possible relevance to human health.""        The possibility that whatever is causing deformities in frogs may also be linked to human health is indicated by a 1996 study by University of Minnesota researchers (         EHP        104[4]:394-399). The study showed an increased incidence of abnormality and chromosomal aberration among children born to pesticide appliers in Minnesota. In western Minnesota, a major wheat, sugar beet, and potato growing region, the increase was particularly pronounced for children conceived in the spring, the time of heaviest pesticide application.        Field work in the MPCA/NIEHS collaboration began during the frog breeding season in July 1997. On 30 September 1997, the MPCA and the NIEHS held a joint press conference to convey results of preliminary studies. Water and sediment samples were collected from affected and unaffected ponds in Minnesota and tested using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay:         Xenopus        , known as FETAX. The assay involves exposing developing embryos of         Xenopus laevis        to toxins for four days and observing any resulting malformations. Although this is not the same frog species as those observed with naturally occurring malformations in Minnesota, at concentrations above 50%, water from the ponds with a high incidence of malformed frogs induced a high rate of malformations in the FETAX as well. There is good agreement for birth defects between the FETAX and rodent bioassays, which are often used as the basis for regulatory decisions concerning environmental contaminants and human health. Water from ponds that did not contain malformed frogs did not induce effects in the FETAX. However, preliminary findings suggest that similar effects are induced by groundwater and well water collected at residences near the affected ponds, prompting further concern for human health. The residents have been advised of the findings and offered the option of having the state provide bottled water as a precaution until more is known. George Lucier, director of the Environmental Toxicology Program at the NIEHS, says, ""We know that something in the water, including groundwater, is extraordinarily potent in malforming frogs. We now need to determine if people are at risk.""        The goals of the MPCA/NIEHS project call for establishing continuity in the field observations taken over the past three years, and characterizing the frequency and nature of the malformations in frog larval stages and metamorphs. The researchers will continue to conduct chemical analyses of water and sediment from test sites where deformed animals have previously been observed, as well as from sites containing no deformed frogs, and attempt to determine the identity of the causative agent or agents.            An approach to studying the affected waters in standardized rodent teratogenicity assays is being considered, and an evaluation of human health effects associated with living in the affected areas is planned in collaboration with state and federal epidemiologists. Says Burkhart, ""The exciting thing about this is that, within Minnesota, we have a set of circumstances that provides a basis for study. With numerous sites containing confirmed deformities, we have at least some opportunity to determine cause and effect.""                   John Manuel                            Wading through Questions about Aquatic Toxins                                                                       Anabaena circinalis                                               The toxic dinoflagellate         Pfiesteria piscicida        may have captured the spotlight along the coast of North Carolina and Maryland, but this nefarious creature is not the only one of its kind. Worldwide, toxic aquatic organisms responsible for such maladies as red tides, cholera outbreaks, and seafood poisoning have surfaced with increasing frequency and geographic distribution during the past 20 years. Such surfacings have brought more questions than answers, questions that an assemblage of scientists recently tried to answer at the NIEHS Workshop on Hazardous Marine/Freshwater Microbes and Toxins, held 26-27 August 1997 at the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.                                                                   Prorocentrum lima                                               Top         Pfiesteria        expert JoAnn Burkholder, an associate professor of aquatic botany at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, unveiled new research findings from August experiments in which she and her colleagues isolated and purified a water-soluble toxin from the fish-killing organism         Pfiesteria        . Her collaborative work with the NIEHS and the National Marine Fisheries Service has also produced the first reliable test for detecting low levels of the toxin in water samples in the laboratory. This reporter gene assay will now be tested in the field. Also, Burkholder and Karen Steidinger of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection confirmed that at least four         Pfiesteria        -like organisms occurring from Alabama to Delaware have been identified, although only         P. piscicida        has been formally named.        Researchers from the NIEHS Marine and Freshwater Biomedical Sciences Center in Miami, Florida, reported on the isolation of a lipid-soluble fraction that causes dermal necrosis in fish. This work is a collaboration between the Miami center and Ed Noga at North Carolina State University.                                                                   Alexandrium tamarense                                               Meanwhile, other presenters described an array of syndromes traced to other marine and freshwater algae and some toxins that are responsible for deleterious effects on people and animals. Severe and even fatal reactions in human seafood consumers have resulted from the neurotoxins delivered in paralytic, neurotoxic (associated with red tide organisms), and amnesiac shellfish poisonings as well as ciguatera fish poisoning. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, common in areas surrounding intensive marine aquaculture operations, is traced to okadaic acid, a potent toxin that inhibits the secretion of protein enzymes key to regulating the body's metabolism and cell function. Also, toxins from blue-green algae have caused liver damage in humans and animals. Unlike such foodborne bacteria as salmonella and         E. coli        , which can be removed through proper cooking, most of the toxins discussed at the workshop are particularly insidious because they are heat-stable.                                                                   Gymnodinium breve                                               Daniel Baden, director of the NIEHS Marine and Freshwater Biomedical Sciences Center in Miami, gave the first of several in-depth talks at the workshop on the chemical properties and structural workings of waterborne toxins and how they attack the nervous systems and cellular functions of target organisms. ""These are really elegant studies, down to the molecular level,"" said John Pritchard, chief of the NIEHS laboratory of pharmacology and chemistry, during a roundtable discussion. ""I think the challenge for us is to take this kind of information and . . . use this increased detailed understanding to develop either therapeutic strategies or increased-sensitivity assays--specific assays for specific toxins--to identify the particular players that are involved in environmental health issues.""                                                                   Dinophysis fortii                                               Participants pinpointed a variety of theories for the worldwide surge in hazardous aquatic pathogens and harmful algal blooms. Keynote speaker Rita Colwell, president of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute in College Park and former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, outlined the connection between increases in global temperature and unusual El Niño events and the opportunistic growth and spread of organisms such as         Vibrio cholerae        , which thrive on ubiquitous zooplankton. Colwell also examined the role of ocean currents and seagoing vessels that collect and discharge ballast water in transporting these organisms.        Other culprits in increased reported algal and dinoflagellate activity include coastal eutrophication caused by polluted runoff and rainfall, and possibly even an escalation in reporting of events due to new methods of detection and scrutiny. Baden stressed, however, that each organism has different ecological requirements, and general statements about the relationship of pollution to algal and dinoflagellate activity cannot be made.                                                                   Chattonella antigua                                           A consensus of the workshop was that the scientific community has made great strides in understanding the acute effects of marine and freshwater toxins on human and animal species at the molecular level. But more research is needed to examine chronic effects such as accumulation of toxins and immunosuppression that may result from long-term exposure. More epidemiological studies would help, said Baden, citing the link between exposure to brevetoxins from algal blooms and respiratory effects. ""If red tides occur every year on the west coast of Florida, which they do, is there chronic respiratory disease of some kind?"" Baden said. ""Well, the populations of west coast areas are skewed towards retirement-age individuals, so many are already predisposed to respiratory disease. Because such people are, in a sense, compromised before they ever even inhale, research into synergistic effects between these environmental chemicals and human health is a pressing issue.""                                                                   Gymnodinium mikimotoi                                           Researchers at the workshop also expressed the need for a better understanding of the causative role of these organisms in their natural environment, better monitoring of environmental indicators prior to epidemics and epizootics, and the development of detection methods that have inexpensive, reliable field applications. Better cooperation between scientists and communication with the public were also deemed essential. ""There needs to be more dialogue between scientists, policy makers, and public health officials to achieve a better linkage between research priorities and the development process of public policy,"" said NIEHS director Kenneth Olden in a challenge to the audience, which included public health officials from East Coast states and the federal government, food safety specialists, physicians, policy makers, environmentalists, and educators.        Baden said the meeting helped advance an accord. ""The beauty,"" he said, ""was that we brought people together at this particular conference that are interested in the ocean and now are wading in to the shore. We got the people on land who are interested in human health issues walking down to the shore. And today they shook hands at the beachhead.""

GX042-12-14970992	Malformed frogs in Minnesota: an update   U.S. Department of the Interior USGS Fact Sheet 043-01    U.S. Geological Survey May 2001         This fact sheet is available as a pdf file (225KB).   Background                                 (Photo by David Hoppe)               Malformed frogs first became the topic of national news in August 1995 when    students at a middle school in southern Minnesota discovered one-half of all    the frogs they caught in a nearby pond were malformed. Since then, malformed    frogs have been reported throughout Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States    and Canada ( http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/narcam ), and in other countries. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has been    leading much of the research to discover the cause(s) for these malformations    in Minnesota. The U.S. Geological Survey has been collaborating in this effort    with studies on virus, bacteria, and parasite identification; water and sediment    chemistry; hydrology and land use. Scientists from numerous federal agencies    and universities also have been working with MPCA to find causes for this problem    (see list on page 3). A chronicle of this effort conducted within Minnesota    and elsewhere is presented in a book titled “A Plague of Frogs: the Horrifying    True Story” (Souder, 2000) and in the Minnesota Conservation Volunteer    (Souder, 2001). While malformed frogs also have been found in many  other states, numerous studies have focused on malformed frogs in Minnesota,    and significant progress toward finding a cause or causes for malformation has    been made. This Fact Sheet summarizes scientific results from malformed-frog    studies conducted primarily in Minnesota.     Field Survey of Minnesota Frogs                             Figure 1:  Locations where malformed frogs have been found in Minnesota,        1995-2000 (from Murzyn, 2000)         From 1995 through 2000, nearly 25,000 frogs from 195 sites in Minnesota have    been caught, examined, and released by MPCA scientists and collaborators, according    to the MPCA Malformed Frogs database (Murzyn, 2000). Malformed frogs have been    found throughout Minnesota (fig. 1). Malformations were found in 8 species of    frogs and toads. For northern leopard frogs ( Rana pipiens ), the species    most commonly found in Minnesota, 6.5 percent of 13,763 frogs collected were    malformed. Malformations included missing limbs, missing digits, extra limbs,    partial limbs, skin webbing, malformed jaws, and missing or extra eyes (Helgen    and others, 1998; Canfield and others, 2000; Meteyer, Loeffler, and others,    2000). At some sites, many malformed frogs had “bony triangles” (bone    bridges) in X-ray images, an abnormal development that also has been induced    in frogs exposed to retinoid chemicals in the laboratory (Gardiner and Hoppe,    1999). The ends of partially developed bones often had a spongy appearance in    X-ray images (Lannoo and others, 2001); this differs from what is seen when    a predator causes partial limbs, indicating that attacks by predators did not    cause those missing or partial limbs (Lannoo, 2000). Nearly all malformed frogs    found since 1995 have been juveniles (Hoppe, 2001; Lannoo, 2000), indicating    that malformed frogs rarely survive to become adults. This lack of survival    may be contributing to the population decline reported for some amphibian species.   Historical malformation rates for frogs   In the past, malformed frogs were rarely found in Minnesota. Only 0.2 percent    of 2,433 frog specimens collected in Minnesota during 1958-63 that are archived    at the Bell Museum of Natural History at the University of Minnesota   were malformed (Hoppe, 2000). Another 0.5 percent were abnormal due to predator    attacks. Hoppe (2000) reported that only 0.2 percent of 1,772 frogs from nine    field sites in west-central Minnesota during 1973-93 were malformed or were    missing limbs from predator attack. In contrast, during 1996-97 Hoppe (2000)    found that 2.3 percent of 2,548 frogs from those same nine sites were malformed    (site-specific malformation percentages ranged from 0 to 9.4). Burkhart and    others (2000) indicated that it is difficult to find sites that do not have    malformed frogs.   Frog malformations at abnormal sites                             Figure 2:  Malformation rates peak at different times from year        to year and at different times from site to site (Murzyn, 2000).         At some sites in Minnesota the percentages of malformed frogs have been much    higher since 1995. Twenty of the 195 MPCA sites have frequencies of frog malformations    in excess of 5 percent and are termed “abnormal” sites. Some abnormal    sites have malformation rates far in excess of 5 percent. At one site, for example,    25 percent of juvenile northern leopard frogs were malformed. At another site,    68 percent of all juvenile mink frogs ( Rana septentrionalis ) were malformed    (Hoppe, 2001). The frequency of malformations peaked at different times of the    year at different sites, generally from early August to early October (fig.    2) (Canfield and others, 2000). The types of malformations at these abnormal    sites differed from site to site as well (Meteyer, Loeffler, and others, 2000),    suggesting multiple causes or combinations of causes for malformations. Missing    limbs were the predominant malformation at one abnormal site, skin webbings    were the most common malformation at another, and malformations of several types    were observed at yet another abnormal site (fig. 3). Many of the malformation    types recorded since 1995 have not been observed previously by Minnesota herpetologists    (Hoppe, 2000). At a few of the abnormal sites, the percentage of malformed frogs    has declined in recent years, but so has the total number of frogs (Canfield    and others, 2000). Severe population die-offs at some of these sites have made    it difficult to conduct studies on causes for malformation because it has become    difficult to find frogs, especially northern leopard frogs (Shappell and others,    2000; Hoppe, 2001). A virus was found to be responsible for some of the die-offs    (Meteyer, Cole, and others, 2000).                           Figure 3:  Examples of malformations observed in Minnesota ponds.         (Photographers, from top clockwise: MPCA, David Hoppe, Carol Meteyer.)         Abnormal sites exist in many different types of ponds and wetlands in Minnesota    (fig. 4), but certain characteristics of some of the abnormal sites are noteworthy.    Three of the abnormal sites were constructed wetlands, with little aquatic vegetation,    firm sediments, and sometimes steeply sloping shorelines. Two of the worst abnormal    sites have water that contains fewer dissolved minerals than most Minnesota    wetlands (Jones and others, 2000). Some scientists speculated that ground-water    contamination may have been contributing to the frog malformations at some of    the abnormal sites. However, follow-up research on the hydrology of some of    the abnormal sites indicates there is a notable lack of ground water flowing    into those ponds (Jones and others, 1999).                                   Figure 4 : High rates of frog malformations have been found in          a variety of ponds and wetlands.  (Photographers from top clockwise:          Eric Garber, Perry Jones, Eric Garber.)                   Suspected causes for malformed frogs   Parasites   Many frog malformations in the western United States appear to be caused by    the parasite  Ribeiroia ondatrae  (Johnson and others, 1999; Johnson and    Lunde, 1999), a trematode (flatworm) that develops inside aquatic snails before    burrowing into tadpoles (Johnson and others, 2001). Several species of amphibians    developed high frequencies (40 to 100 percent) of severe limb malformations    when exposed to  Ribeiroia  in the laboratory (Johnson and others, 2001).    Other researchers have simulated the effects of parasite infection, demonstrating    that malformation can result from simply inserting tiny beads into tadpoles    at the location where hind limbs   form (Sessions and Ruth, 1990). At several of the abnormal sites in Minnesota,    the frogs are heavily infected with  Ribeiroia  (Sutherland, 2001); however,     Ribeiroia  has not been found at other abnormal sites in Minnesota (Sutherland,    2001), indicating that other factors are causing malformations at those abnormal    sites. It is not clear why  Ribeiroia  infection may have increased in    recent years, but there is some evidence that higher levels of nutrients may    promote the parasite’s life cycle (Johnson and others, 2001).   Chemicals   Human-made chemicals often are suspected as the cause for frog malformation    in Minnesota. Chemical analysis of water samples from most of the abnormal sites    in Minnesota indicated no unusual concentrations for dozens of   compounds analyzed by the Minnesota Department of Health (Helgen and others,    1998) and the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (Burkhart    and others, 1998).   Pesticides are known to cause malformation or death of frogs when present in    sufficient concentrations (Harfenist and others, 1989). Studies in Canada show    a relation between the percentage of malformed frogs and pesticide use   (Ouellet and others, 1997; Bishop and others, 1999). At the abnormal sites in    Minnesota, few pesticides or degradation products were detected in water and    sediment samples, and those detected were present in very small quantities (Jones    and others, 1999). Methoprene, an insecticide widely used to control mosquitoes,    also has been suspected as having caused malformations. Laboratory studies on    northern leopard frogs by the Environmental Protection Agency indicated no induced    malformations at methoprene concentrations commonly found in the environment    (Ankley and others, 1998). In contrast, field trials of methoprene applied at    mosquito-control concentrations did result in malformations among southern leopard    frogs, a species not found in Minnesota (Sparling, 2000).   Endocrine disruptors also are being studied to determine if they are responsible    for some of the frog malformations in Minnesota. Endocrine disruptors are natural    and human-made chemicals that interfere with or mimic natural hormones that    control development, growth, and behavior of organisms. The number of endocrine    disruptors is unknown; only during the last decade has screening of chemicals    begun to evaluate endocrinedisrupting   activity. Environmental retinoids are one class of endocrine disruptors that    has received special attention in the frog malformation studies. Retinoic acid    has been shown to induce frog malformations in the laboratory (Bryant and Gardiner,    1992). Retinoid activity has been identified in some of the ponds in Minnesota    (Gardiner and Hoppe,   1999), but so far no proof exists that the concentrations detected can induce    frog malformations in natural settings.   Estrogens are another class of endocrine disruptors under study. Although normally    associated with sexual development, estrogens at high concentrations also can    affect limb development (Hayes, 2000). Garber and others (2001) used two methods    to detect environmental estrogens at many of the abnormal sites in Minnesota    and found a relation between the concentrations of estrogenic compounds and    the percentages of malformed frogs. They also found low concentrations of some    minerals (sodium, potassium) in some of these ponds where estrogens were found    and suggested that this combination of factors may be related to frog malformation    at sites where parasites were not found in malformed frogs.   Ultraviolet light   The amount of ultraviolet (UV) light reaching the Earth’s surface is increasing    with time, and current amounts of UV   radiation have been shown to cause malformations in frogs in the laboratory    (Hays and others, 1996; Ankley and   others, 1998). Light penetration in water is affected by shading from trees    and aquatic plants, and by the amount and quality of dissolved organic carbon    (Little, 1999). Research at abnormal sites in Minnesota indicates that the amount    of UV radiation penetrating to the 10-centimeter depth in pond water is related    to the percentage of malformed frogs in the pond (Little, 1999). Some scientists    theorize that human-made or natural organic compounds present in Minnesota wetlands    become toxic when activated by UV radiation (Burkhart and others, 1998; Little    and Bridges, 2001).   Combinations of factors   It is likely that one or more combinations of chemicals, biological, and physical    factors are responsible for causing   the malformations in Minnesota frogs (Fort and others, 1999; Burkhart and others,    2000; Lannoo, 2000). Chemical combinations may be mixtures of natural and human-made    organic chemicals, each of which is harmless on its own but toxic when combined    (Burkhart and others, 2000). The number of possible combinations of chemicals,    biological, and physical factors is enormous, which may explain why finding    the causes for frog   malformations has been a difficult task.   A continuing cooperative effort   Scientists have found malformed frogs throughout Minnesota. The incidence of    malformation since 1995 exceeds historical malformation rates. Parasites cause    some or most of the malformations at some, but not all of the sites. Many questions    persist, and more work is needed to understand the causes for malformation that    remain unexplained. Scientists from many different disciplines and organizations    continue to work on the Minnesota malformed-frog mystery, both in laboratory    studies and in the field. The MPCA is coordinating this research, and continues    to collect much of the data on frog populations throughout the State.

The principal responsibilities of the Emergency Programs unit in APHIS' Veterinary Services (VS) are to ensure prompt evaluation of suspect outbreaks, and, when a foreign animal disease is diagnosed, to coordinate a prompt and thorough eradication of an outbreak. The mission of Emergency Programs is to prevent destructive and harmful effects on the health of animals and human populations in the United States from epizootics of foreign and emerging animal diseases and from natural and technological disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, nuclear fallout and chemical fallout. To accomplish this, VS has developed and maintained a high level of expertise and preparedness and leads and coordinates rapid response efforts to safeguard the well-being of our animal populations and enhance public health.  Field Investigations--1996  During fiscal year (FY) 1996 (October 1, 1995September 30, 1996), veterinary medical officers from USDA, APHIS, VS, and State departments of agriculture conducted 420 investigations of suspicious foreign animal diseases in the United States to explore the possibility that an exotic disease might have been introduced. Seventy-four investigations were conducted in the Central Region, 100 in the Northern Region, 50 in the Southeastern Region, and 196 in the Western Region. These diseases or conditions included abortion, avian diseases, acute death, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, myiasis and ascariasis, mucosal disorders, respiratory disorders, septicemia, and vesicular conditions. VS personnel also performed surveillance activities in regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). These figures do not include the field investigations done for vesicular stomatitis in FY 1996.  Field Investigations--1997  During FY 1997, 718 foreign animal disease (FAD) investigations were conducted (316 routine FAD investigations and 402 investigations for vesicular stomatitis). Chart 1 illustrates the number of investigations for FY 1997 by the condition investigated. These values do not include vesicular investigations from May 18 to September 30, 1997. That notwithstanding, the majority of investigations were for vesicular conditions (122) with encephalitic and CNS conditions (66) next most frequent. Chart 2 shows the number of routine investigations by species for FY 1997. The largest number of investigations for suspected FAD's was 129 for bovines, and equines came in second with a total of 88 investigations. Other species investigations were as shown.  3   Chart 1  Routine FAD Investigations*--By Condition Investigated October 1, 1996, to September 30, 1997 Av ian DZ/ acut e d eat h B SE Surveil la n ce Encep h alit ic /CNS Excess acut e d eat h Muc osal Myi asis/A scari asis Othe r Respir ato ry, severe Sep ticemi a Sponta neo u s abor tion Vesic u lar Vi re mia of Car p  33 31 66 13 9 4 23 7 2 5 122 1  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  140  *Does not include Vesicular investigations from May 18, 1997, to September 30, 1997.

Total investigations for 1995 increased by over 300 percent with a total of 981 investigations for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) alone. The number of routine FAD investigations increased in 1996, during which 181 investigations for VSV took place. There was a decrease in routine FAD investigations in 1997 and an overall increase in the total number of investigations as the result of the VSV outbreak during the year.

In anticipation of this restructuring, VS has decided to take a proactive posture and immediately begin the restructuring of the READEO from four organizations to two. This will enable VS to have a stable emergency response posture, should an exotic or new animal or poultry disease emerge during the VS restructuring. The agency will benefit significantly through cost reductions by maintaining only two organizations rather than the previous four and will better be able to allocate reduced training dollars.  5   Dr. Tom Holt, Assistant Regional Director for VS, Northern Region, has been named director for the eastern READEO, and Dr. Jan Huber, Assistant Regional Director for VS, Central Region, has been named director for the Western READEO. VS has also taken this opportunity to enhance the previous READEO structure. Each READEO will have a new position of assistant READEO director. The previous structure of field operations and technical and administrative support has been maintained, although some of the subunits have been shifted among the three units. Another addition to the READEO is the early response team (ERT)--an FAD diagnostician, an epidemiologist, and a pathologist from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). This team will be called upon to assist the Regional Director, Area Veterinarian-in-Charge, and the State official when an emergency animal disease situation is being evaluated with the possibility of activating the READEO.  6   FAD Update  This update consolidates information from the Office of International Epizootics (OIE) bulletins dated January through April 1997. Countries reporting disease outbreaks are listed below the appropriate disease heading followed the by month and year of the outbreaks and the total number of outbreaks for that period. The notation ""+"" indicates that the presence of disease was reported without information on the number of outbreaks.

Encephalopathy  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), widely known as ""mad cow disease,"" is a chronic, degenerative disease affecting the CNS of cattle. It is one in a family of diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's). Worldwide, there have been more than 170,000 cases of BSE since it was first diagnosed in 1986 in Great Britain. BSE has had a substantial impact on the livestock industry in the United Kingdom. The disease has also been confirmed in native-born cattle in Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Portugal, and Switzerland. However, more than 98 percent of all BSE cases have occurred in Great Britain. BSE is not known to exist in the United States. Owing to the nature of the disease, it is difficult to develop all-inclusive guidelines that would establish BSE-free status for a country. Currently, OIE has criteria to assist countries in evaluating the status of trading partners. This code was adopted in May 1997. The lack of a preclinical screening test that definitively detects all BSE infection adds to the complexity of verifying the absence of the disease. Hence, an active and aggressive surveillance program is essential in any country wishing to claim freedom from BSE. Because many outside factors influence reporting, it is rarely possible to claim freedom from BSE on the basis of passive surveillance alone. In addition, the OIE guidelines take into account certain risk factors that may be present in countries. These risk factors include the importation of infected cattle feed contaminated with the BSE agent (Schreuder et al. 1997), the presence of other animal TSE's, and feeding practices, among others. For the same reason, it is virtually impossible to obtain a true picture of disease prevalence in a country where BSE has been detected. TSE's are caused by a transmissible agent that is yet to be fully characterized. They share the following common characteristics:  A prolonged incubation period of months or years;  A progressive debilitating neurological illness that is always fatal;  The presence of scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF's) when detergent-treated extracts of brain tissue from animals or humans affected by these diseases is examined by electron microscope;  Pathological changes, such as vacuolation and astrocytosis, that appear to be confined to the CNS; and  The absence of any detectable specific immune response in the host. The lack of antibody formation in BSE-infected animals has inhibited the development of a live animal diagnostic test. Listed below are other TSE's.  CreutzfeldtJakob disease  CreutzfeldtJakob Disease (CJD) is a sporadic presenile dementia that affects humans. It occurs at an annual incidence of about one in a million of the population. About 90 percent of the cases are sporadic and have no known source of exposure. Five to 10 percent of the cases are familial and are associated with certain inherited gene mutations. An extremely small number of cases result from iatrogenic transmission through such mechanisms as corneal transplants, contaminated pituitary growth hormone injections, or the use of poorly disinfected brain electrodes (Brown 1988a, b).  10   New-variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (nvCJD)  Twenty-four cases of nvCJD have been identified in the United Kingdom and France between 1994 and 1996. Unlike sporadic CJD, the cases were unique because the patients were younger than usual, the clinical manifestation was different, and the patients displayed a new neuropatho- logical profile. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) in the United Kingdom concluded that, although there was no direct scientific evidence of a link between BSE and CJD, on the basis of current data and in the absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation is that nvCJD is linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the specified bovine offal ban in 1989 (Will et al. 1996).  Fatal familial insomnia  An extremely rare human disorder characterized by trouble sleeping and disturbances of the autonomic nervous system. An inherited mutation in the PrP gene has been identified as the precipitating factor of this disease (Tateishi et al. 1995).  GerstmannStrussler Scheinker syndrome  A rare familial syndrome of humans caused by an inherited mutation in the PrP gene affecting about 50 extended families. The syndrome is characterized by loss of coordination and dementia (Prusiner 1995).  Kuru  A disease of the Fore tribe in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. The disease is characterized by a loss of coordination followed by dementia. The infection was thought to spread through the practice of cannibalism and exposure to high-risk tissues such as brain. Since cannibalism was discontinued, kuru has essentially disappeared.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD)  CWD was first discovered in 1967 and reported by Williams and Young (1980) and originally was confined to mule deer and Rocky Mountain elk held in captivity in Colorado and Wyoming (Williams and Young 1982). CWD has more recently been confirmed in free-ranging cervids in Colorado and Wyoming, such as mule deer, whiteand black-tailed deer, and elk. CWD has also been diagnosed in ranch-raised elk in South Dakota. The disease is characterized by emaciation, changes in behavior, and excessive salivation. A naturally occurring TSE first reported in domestic cats in 1990 (Wyatt et al. 1990). More than 70 cases of FSE have been diagnosed in the United Kingdom since 1990. In addition, one case of has been identified in Norway (Bratberg et al. 1995) and one in Liechtenstein. Cats with the disease display locomotor disturbances, behavioral changes, and hypersensitivity to sudden movements or noises (Wyatt et al. 1991). Current evidence suggests that the disease in cats is most probably linked to BSE.  Feline spongiform encephalopathy  11   Scrapie  An insidious degenerative disease affecting the CNS of sheep and goats. The disease is also called la tremblante (French: trembling), Traberkrankheit (German: trotting disease), or Rida (Icelandic: ataxia or tremor). Scrapie was first recognized as a disease of sheep in Great Britain and other countries of Western Europe more than 250 years ago. Scrapie has been reported worldwide and affects most sheepproducing regions. Australia and New Zealand are commonly accepted to be scrapie free. The disease has been recognized for over two centuries in England, Wales, and Germany (Parry 1983). The first U.S. case of scrapie was diagnosed in 1947.  Transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME)  An uncommon disease of ranch-raised mink first reported in the United States in 1947 and described by Hartsough and Burger (1965). TME has been reported in Canada, Finland, Germany, Russia, and the United States. The last U.S. case was in Wisconsin in 1985 (Marsh and Hadlow 1992). It has been suggested that TME is a result of feeding either scrapie-infected sheep or infected cattle to mink.  Other cases of spongiform encephalopathy have been reported in kudus, elands, nyalas, gemsboks, and a few exotic cats. These occurrences are also thought to be linked to contaminated feed.  Etiology  The clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic features of BSE, as well as other TSE's, have led to speculation on the nature of the etiologic agent and the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease. There are three main theories on the nature of the scrapie agent. The Virus Theory--In this theory, the virus would have to have unusual biochemical and biophysical characteristics that would help explain its remarkable physicochemical properties (Rohwer 1984, Czub et al. 1988, Manuelidis et al. 1988). The Prion Theory--Here the agent is believed to be composed exclusively of the host-coded protein (PrPc), which becomes partially protease resistant (PrPBSE)--most likely through a posttranslational conformation change after infection. In this theory, there are no nonhost components of the agent. That is, a specific informational molecule (nucleic acid such as RNA or DNA) is not present (Prusiner 1982, Bolton and Bendheim 1988). The Virino Theory--This theory states that the BSE agent consists of a host-derived protein coat (PrP is one of the candidates for this protective protein) and a small noncoding regulatory nucleic acid (Dickinson and Outram 1979, Kimberlin 1982).  12   Comparing the Theories--All three proposed theories have some degree of validity. Proponents of the virus and virino theories conclude that the existence of different scrapie strains unequivocally proves the existence of a nucleic acid component of the infectious agent, which, as in conventional viruses, may undergo mutations responsible for phenotypic variations. The problem with these two theories is that no agent-specific nucleic acid has been convincingly identified to copurify with infectivity (Manuelidis and Manuelidis 1981, Duguid et al. 1988, Oesch et al. 1988, Meyer et al. 1991, Sklaviadis et al. 1993). Moreover, chemical, enzymatic, or physical treatments that usually inactivate or degrade nucleic acids have no effect on the transmissible properties of the BSE infectious agent (McKinley et al. 1983; Bellinger Kawahara et al. 1987a,b; Neary et al. 1991). Possible reasons for this lack of effect are that the amount of nucleic acid of the putative agent is too small to be detected with available techniques and that its tight bond to the protein protects it from chemical or physical inactivation. Weakening the virus and virino theories are also the inability to identify any virus particles under the electron microscope (Bots et al. 1971, Cho and Greig 1975) and the failure of an infected host to generate an immune response. [It should be noted that small particles resembling virus structures have recently been observed by electron microscopy (Ozel and Diringer 1994).] The prion model involves propagation of a protein-only agent (PrPBSE) whereby PrP can assume various tertiary structures caused by a combination of host genetics and the introduction of altered (infectious) PrP. Hence, the structure of the infecting PrPBSE imprints upon the normal cellular precursor (PrPc), which results in a change of shape to the protease-resistant form. Researchers suspect that mutations in the PrP gene may render resulting proteins susceptible to ""flipping,"" and the shape changes account for what is commonly referred to as ""strain"" differences. Several explanations for scrapie strain genetics in the context of the prion theory have been suggested, but not one has been proven (Prusiner 1991, Weissman 1991). A recent publication suggests that passaging the agent through different hosts causes the conformational change, possibly limiting prion diversity (Scott et al. 1997). However, this study could not eliminate the existence of a mixture of prion strains. It should be pointed out that the prion theory fails to explain (1) how the PrP of the infecting agent originally assumed the aberrant structure associated with infectivity and (2) how the different structures originated as a function of the different strains. Although numerous scrapie strains can be differentiated in a single host (i.e., sheep), the PrP associated with these strains has not shown any biochemical and molecular differences. BSE seems to be caused by a single strain type. This BSE strain is different from historical or contemporary isolates from sheep or goats with natural scrapie as determined by study of incubation periods and brain ""lesion profiles"" in mice. Regardless of whether the prion (PrPBSE) is or is not the agent, the partially proteaseresistant form is a marker of infection. Currently several of tests are available to detect the presence of the PrPBSE.  13   Epizootiology  Different scientific hypotheses concerning the origins of BSE have been advanced. The epidemiologic data suggest that BSE in Great Britain is an extended, commonsource epidemic involving feed containing TSE-contaminated meat and bone meal as a protein source. The causative agent is suspected to be from either scrapie-affected sheep or from cattle with a previously unidentified TSE. Changes in rendering operations in the early 1980's--particularly the removal of a solvent-extraction process that included a steam-heat treatment--may have played a part in the appearance of the disease and the subsequent amplification of the agent in the food chain. A ban in Great Britain on feeding animal protein of ruminant origin to ruminants was enacted in July 1988 (Wilesmith et al. 1992). In Great Britain, the epidemic peaked in 199293, when about, 1,000 cases were reported each week. In 1997, BSE remained on the decline, with approximately 100 cases reported weekly. Cases that have been detected in other countries appear to be a result of importations of live cattle or, more significantly, contaminated feed from the United Kingdom. There is no evidence that BSE spreads horizontally, that is, by contact between unrelated adult cattle or from cattle to other species. Results of recent British research show very low levels of transmission of BSE from affected cows to their offspring. These results demonstrate about a 9-percent increase in the occurrence of BSE in offspring of BSE-affected dams as compared with calves born to dams that did not later demonstrate BSE infection. The study did not ascertain if this was the result of genetic factors or true transmission. The research did, however, point out that at this level, if maternal transmission does occur, it will not sustain the epidemic (Wilesmith et al. 1997). A TSE has been diagnosed in eight species of captive wild ruminants as well as exotic and domestic cats. There have been more than 80 cases of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) in Great Britain, 1 in a domestic cat in Norway, 1 in Northern Ireland, and 1 in Liechtenstein. The agent isolated from several of these cases using strain typing in mice is indistinguishable from BSE in cattle, suggesting that FSE is actually BSE in exotic and domestic cats. This also appears to be true for the other ruminants. Epidemiologic evidence suggests protein-enhanced feed from ISSEinfected carcasses to be the primary source of infection in these species (MAFF Progress Report, June 1997). Some authorities have suggested that 24 cases (as of January 31, 1997) of a variant form of CJD (nvCJD) in Great Britain (U.K. Department of Health, March 1998) and France may be linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of a specified bovine offal (SBO) ban at slaughter in 1989. The SBO ban excluded from human consumption brain, spinal cord, and other tissues with potential BSE infectivity.  14   BSE has been experimentally transmitted to the following species via intracerebral inoculation: cattle, sheep, goats (Foster et al. 1993), mink (Robinson et al. 1994), pigs (Dawson et al. 1990), marmosets (Baker et al. 1993), macaques (Lasmzas et al. 1996), and mice (Fraser et al. 1988). Intracranial transmission was attempted in hamsters but was not successful. BSE has been successfully transmitted via the oral route to cattle, sheep, goats (Foster et al. 1993), mice (Barlow and Middleton 1990), and mink (Robinson et al. 1994). Oral transmission has been attempted in swine. The inoculated swine were euthanized after 84 months of age and had not exhibited any signs of a TSE. Parenteral and oral transmission have also been attempted in chickens with no evidence of disease thus far, even 12 months into a second passage.  BSE and CJD--Human Health Concerns  On March 20, 1996, the SEAC announced the identification of 10 cases of nvCJD. All of the patients developed symptoms of disease in 1994 or 1995. The following points describe how these 10 cases differed from other routinely diagnosed cases of CJD:  The affected individuals were much younger than the sporadic CJD patient. Typically, CJD patients are over 63 years old. The average patient age for the variant form of CJD is 27.5 (range of 16 to 42) years. (The term ""sporadic"" is used here, after Dr. John Collinge, to indicate classical CJD.)  The course of the disease in the nvCJD averaged 13 months. Sporadic CJD cases average a 6-month duration.  In the 10 victims, electroencephalographic activity was not typical of CJD.  Although brain pathology was recognizable as CJD, the pattern was different from sporadic CJD, as manifested by large aggregates of prion protein plaques. Epidemiologic and case studies have not revealed exposure to a common risk factor. According to the SEAC, all victims were reported to have eaten beef or beef products in the last 10 years, but none had knowingly eaten brain material. One of the affected individuals had been a vegetarian since 1991 (Will et al. 1996). The SEAC concluded that, although there was no direct scientific evidence of a link between BSE and nvCJD, on the basis of current data and in the absence of any credible alternative, the most likely explanation was that the cases resulted from exposure to BSE before the introduction of control measures--in particular, the SBO ban in 1989. Research reported in later 1996 and 1997 has found further evidence to link nvCJD to BSE. Two significant studies published in the October 2, 1997, edition of Nature led the SEAC to conclude that BSE agent is highly likely to be the cause of nvCJD. Dr. Moira Bruce and colleagues at the Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh, Scotland, inoculated three panels of inbred mice and one panel of crossbred mice with BSE, nvCJD, and CJD. Mice inoculated with BSE showed the same pattern of incubation time, clinical signs, and brain lesions as mice inoculated with tissues from patients with nvCJD. This finding provides evidence that BSE and nvCJD have the same signature or are the same ""strain."" In addition, sporadic CJD and known scrapie strains were found not to be similar to nvCJD or BSE (Bruce et al. 1997).  15   The second set of results, published by Dr. John Collinge and colleagues of Imperial College School of Medicine, London, strongly supported Bruce's results. Collinge's paper reported findings of BSE transmission to transgenic mice expressing only human PrP (Hill et al. 1997). Another paper by Collinge et al. in the October 24, 1996, edition of Nature discussed a molecular analysis of prion strain variation in relation to the etiology of nvCJD. Collinge and colleagues demonstrated that two of the three forms of CJD (sporadic and iatrogenic) can be distinguished from one another, after treatment by proteolytic cleavage, by differing band sizes using Western blot analysis. Types 1 and 2 are associated with different clinicopathological phenotypes of sporadic CJD, and type 3 is seen in iatrogenic CJD cases where there is a peripheral route of inoculation. Iatrogenic cases of CJD with a direct CNS exposure resemble the pattern manifested by sporadic CJD. The nvCJD, although resembling type 3 to some degree, can be differentiated from each of the three types by a specific pattern of band intensities. Furthermore, glycoform patterns of the nvCJD were ""closely similar to"" patterns from wild-type mice inoculated with BSE and ""closely resembled"" those from FSE as well as patterns from macaques inoculated with BSE. However, natural BSE was not detected through Western blot analysis using the antibodies in the aforementioned studies (3F4 monoclonal or R073 polyclonal). The use of rabbit antibody to synthetic human PrP peptide (95108) with BSE from its natural host, the cow, did generate a signal and glycoforms closely similar to transmitted BSE and nvCJD (Collinge et al. 1996). The Health and Safety Executive in the United Kingdom now advises that BSE must be considered a biological agent (human pathogen) within the meaning of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994 (HSE Press Release, October 1997).  Actions Taken in the United Kingdom in Response to nvCJD  As a result of the identification of the variant form of CJD, the following measures have been put into place in the United Kingdom (MAFF Progress Report, June 1997):  In November 1989, entry into the human food supply of any protein derived from bovine brain, spinal cord, tonsil, thymus, spleen, or intestine was prohibited. These tissues were referred to as SBO and now are referred to as specified bovine material (SBM).  The spinal column and heads of bovine animals over 6 months old, except for the tongue, are to be treated as SBM. Such materials and their derivatives may not be used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical, or medicinal products.  Mammalian meat and bonemeal are not to be incorporated into any feed for any farmed animals, including fish or horses, or into fertilizer likely to be used on land to which ruminants have access.  Meat from animals over 30 months old is prohibited from entering the human or animal food supply.  16    On July 24, 1996, MAFF announce its intention to introduce controls requiring the removal of sheep heads from the food chain following a study showing evidence that BSE could be isolated from spleens of sheep experimentally infected with BSE.  In September 1996, the Heads of Sheep and Goats Order was put into effect.  In January 1997, selective cull began. The selective cull targets cattle born on a farm around the same time as BSE cases born on that farm between July 1989 and June 1993 that would have been exposed to the same risk of infection by the BSE agent in feed.  Infectivity of Tissues, Products, and Body Fluids  In the naturally infected animals, the BSE agent has been identified in brain, spinal cord, and retina. Agent identification was by mouse bioassay. The route of inoculation into the mice was intracranial. The naturally infected animals were adult cattle exhibiting clinical signs of disease (Fraser et al. 1988). Experiments with mice that were fed milk, mammary glands, placentas, lymph nodes, or spleens have failed to transmit the disease within the natural lifespan of the mice or to establish subclinical infection of the lymphoreticular system (Middleton and Barlow 1993). Another study is ongoing to examine the pathogenesis of BSE by quantifying the replication (tissue distribution) of the agent during the incubation period. This study has identified the agent via mouse bioassay in the distal ileum of experimentally infected calves. It is thought that the agent may be associated with the lymphoid tissue of the intestines. The calves were 4 months of age at the time of oral dosing. First isolation of the agent in the distal ileum was made at 6 months after the challenge. Subsequent isolations from the distal ileum were made at 10, 14, and 18 months after dosing (Wells et al. 1994). Recently, this study has also disclosed infectivity in bone marrow and trigeminal and dorsal root gangli (UK MAFF Website). More than 40 tissues have been examined from cattle using the mouse bioassay. It appears as if the distribution of the BSE agent is not as diverse as that of the scrapie agent in sheep. Another consideration that must be noted is the species barrier using the mouse bioassay. There is a possibility that the agent is present but is found in such very low levels that the bioassay is not sensitive enough to detect it (MAFF Progress Report, June 1997).  Clinical Signs  Cattle afflicted with BSE develop a progressive degeneration of the nervous system. Affected animals may display changes in temperament, abnormalities of posture and movement, and changes in sensation. More specifically, the signs include apprehension, nervousness or aggression, incoordination (especially hind-limb ataxia, tremor, and difficulty in rising), and hyperesthesia to sound and touch. In addition, many animals have decreased milk production and/or loss of body condition despite continued appetite. There is no treatment, and affected cattle die.  17   The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 years. Following the onset of clinical signs, the animal's condition gradually deteriorates until the animal becomes recumbent, dies, or is destroyed. This usually takes from 2 weeks to 6 months. Most cases in Great Britain have occurred in dairy cows (Frisians) between 3 and 6 years of age (Wilesmith et al. 1992).  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of BSE is based on the occurrence of clinical signs of the disease and currently must be confirmed by postmortem laboratory testing. Histopathologic examination of brain tissue collected after the animal dies or is euthanized is the initial step in the diagnostic process. Bilaterally symmetrical degenerative changes are usually seen in the gray matter of the brain stem. These changes are characterized by vacuolation or microcavitation of nerve cells in the brain-stem nuclei. The neural perikarya and axons of certain brain-stem nuclei contain intracytoplasmic vacuoles of various sizes, giving the impression of a spongy brain. Hypertrophy of astrocytes often accompanies the vacuolation (Wells et al. 1987). A diagnosis may also be made by the detection of scrapie-associated fibrils using electron microscopy. Supplemental tests are available to enhance the diagnostic capabilities for BSE. Research has shown that the partially protease-resistant form of the prion protein (PrPBSE) is found in the brain of BSE-infected cattle. Two tests may currently be used to detect the PrPBSE. These are immunohistochemistry and the Western blot technique. In the past, if the brain tissue was not harvested shortly after the animal's death autolysis made it very difficult to confirm a diagnosis. Both of these tests allow for the possibility of confirming a diagnosis of BSE even if the brain has been frozen or has autolyzed. The potential live-animal tests, including some in development, are as follows:  Tests specific for the partially protease-resistant form of the prion protein: (1) A capillary electrophoresis test, and (2) A Western blot test with increased sensitivity.  Tests that identify unique substances of infected animals or humans: (1) A cyclic voltametric method that describes unique substances in urine, and (2) An immunoblot test describing unique substances in cerebrospinal fluid.  Tests for PrPBSE in the preclinical cow may not be as successful as they are appearing to be in scrapie diagnosis because PrPBSE has not yet been detected in peripheral tissues. Differential diagnoses for BSE include rabies, listeriosis, nervous ketosis, milk fever, grass tetany, lead poisoning, and other toxicities or etiological agents that affect the nervous or musculoskeletal systems of adult cattle.  18   Treatment, Prevention, and Control  There is no known treatment for BSE or any of the TSE's, and there is no vaccine to prevent these diseases. BSE from foreign sources may be prevented by the implementation of import regulations prohibiting live ruminants and ruminant products (especially meat, bone meal, and offal). Because the origin of BSE remains unknown, preventing a domestic epidemic of BSE would involve, at a minimum, prohibiting the feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants. The prevention program of any country should also include active surveillance for the early detection of BSE. Most countries have prohibited the importation of cattle and bovine products from countries known to have BSE. In addition, many countries have taken steps to enact regulations prohibiting the feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants. This is true even in countries such as Australia and New Zealand with no known animal TSE's. Agricultural officials in countries known to have BSE have taken a series of actions to control and, it is hoped, eradicate BSE. These include making BSE a notifiable disease, prohibiting the inclusion of certain animal proteins in ruminant rations (the feed bans vary depending on the amount of BSE detected), and the depopulation of certain groups of cattle thought to be of higher risk owing to epidemiologic findings. To prevent human exposure to the BSE agent, some countries have established prohibitions on the inclusion of high-risk material in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.  European Union (EU) Actions  Several EU member countries have had cases of BSE in native cattle or only in imports from the United Kingdom. Other countries have reported BSE in both imports and native cattle, and some member states have not reported BSE. In June 1994, the EU enacted regulations that prohibit feeding mammalian protein to ruminants. On March 27, 1996, the European Commission prohibited the export of most bovine products, including live animals, embryos, meat, meat meal, meat-andbone meal, and other products from the United Kingdom. These restricted products were those most liable to enter the animal or human food chain or be used in medicinal, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic products. In July 1997, the EU adopted legislation restricting the use of ""specified risk material"" (SRM). SRM's include skulls, brains, eyes, tonsils, and spinal cords from all bovines, caprines, and ovines 12 months of age or older. The category also includes spleens from ovines and caprines of any age. The SRM's may not be used in any food, feed, medicinal products, pharmaceuticals, or cosmetics. This legislation is scheduled to be effective as of January 1999.  19   U.S. Actions  An active surveillance program in place for 8 years has not disclosed the presence of BSE in the United States. USDA, FDA, and industry groups actively work to maintain this status. The measures APHIS has taken in this regard include prohibitions or restrictions on certain animal and product imports, ongoing surveillance for signs of the disease in the United States, preparation of an emergency response plan in the event that the disease does occur, and ongoing educational efforts. APHIS actively shares information and coordinates closely with other Federal agencies as well as with the States, livestock and affiliated industries, veterinary and research communities, and consumer groups to ensure that the United States has a uniform approach to TSE's that is based on sound scientific information. APHIS has a comprehensive surveillance program in place in the United States to ensure timely detection and swift response in the event that BSE were to be discovered here. This surveillance program incorporates both the location of imports from the United Kingdom and targeted active and passive surveillance for either BSE or any other TSE in cattle. APHIS has conducted a traceback effort to locate each of the 496 British cattle that were imported into this country between January 1, 1981, and July 1989. In July 1989, the United States prohibited the importation of ruminants from countries affected with BSE. Only 17 of these animals are known to be alive in the United States, and these animals are being carefully monitored by APHIS personnel on an ongoing basis. In addition, in cooperation with the States and industry, APHIS has placed five head of cattle imported from Belgium in 1996 under quarantine, and APHIS makes ongoing attempts to purchase these animals for diagnostic purposes. No evidence of BSE has been found in any of these imported animals. The United States has had an aggressive and active surveillance program for BSE in place since May 1990. BSE is a notifiable disease, and there are more than 250 Federal and State regulatory veterinarians specially trained to diagnose foreign animals diseases, including BSE. Several agencies are involved in the surveillance program, including the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Health and Human Services Department's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. APHIS leads this interagency effort. The surveillance samples include field cases of cattle exhibiting signs of neurologic disease, cattle condemned at slaughter for neurologic reasons, rabies-negative cattle submitted to public health laboratories, neurologic cases submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories and teaching hospitals, and random sampling of cattle that are nonambulatory at slaughter. As of February 21, 1998, more than 6,600 brains had been examined for BSE or any other form of TSE in cattle. No evidence of either condition has been detected by histopathology or immunohistochemistry. As of December 12, 1997, APHIS has prohibited the importation of live ruminants and most ruminant products from all of Europe until a thorough assessment of the risks can be made. The new restrictions apply to Albania, Austria, BosniaHerzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.  20   This action was taken because, in the past year, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have reported their first cases of BSE in native-born cattle. There is evidence that European countries may have had high BSE risk factors for several years and less than adequate surveillance. Additionally, Belgium reported that the cow diagnosed with BSE was processed into the animal food chain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently established regulations that prohibit the feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants. The effective date of this regulation was August 4, 1997.  References  Baker, H. F.; Ridley, R. M.; Wells, G.A.H. 1993. Experimental transmission of BSE and scrapie to the common marmoset.

Many New World species of wildlife are also susceptible but rarely affected. Some of these animals include deer, antelope, bighorn sheep, raccoons, monkeys, sloths, rodents, and bats. This virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of disease in the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. The characteristics of this disease are vesicles in the mouth, on the teats, and on interdigital areas of some animals. Humans can become infected when handling affected animals. In people, vesicular stomatitis is a flulike disease; symptoms include fever and muscle aches and self-limiting blisters that may appear on the hands and in the mouth. The causative agent of vesicular stomatitis is a rhabdovirus of the genus Vesiculovirus. There are two antigenically distinct types of vesicular stomatitis, New Jersey and Indiana. The Indiana type is further categorized into three subtypes: Indiana 1, Indiana 2, and Indiana 3. The most virulent and most common of the two types is the New Jersey strain. The incubation period for this disease is usually 9 days but can range from 3 to 14 days. After the incubation period, infected animals may have increased temperature and oral lesions. The muzzle may appear hyperemic, and a serous fluid may drain from the nose. The animals may also project their tongues from their mouths and make a smacking noise. The lesions may rupture to form large painful ulcerations, leading to dysphagia and reluctance to eat. Frothing at the mouth, drooling, agalactia, weight loss, mastitis, and lameness are observed in some species. Other clinical signs include depression, local soreness, and general discomfort. Affected animals often become emaciated. Vesicular stomatitis can affect all breeds, sexes, and ages of susceptible animals. There is increasing evidence of biological and mechanical transmission via insect vectors. Several potential vectors include phlebotomine flies, mosquitoes, and Culicoides midges. The Indiana strain of vesicular stomatitis has been shown to be transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. Vesicular stomatitis usually occurs during the warmer months or at the end of a rainy season. Most of the previous outbreaks have occurred in summer months and ceased abruptly with the onset of frosts, except the outbreaks of 198283, which continued during the winter. The seasonality of outbreaks supports the theory of transmission via an insect vector. Another major route of infection is believed to be through abraded oral mucosa or skin resulting from grass seeds or awns. Nonbiting flies that feed on ruptured vesicles may also play a role in mechanical spread of infection. The virus can remain viable in the environment for several days, leading to infection. Fomites such as contaminated milking equipment may also be involved in spreading infection. Vesicular stomatitis does not generally cause severe morbidity or mortality. But it can still have a great economic impact on the livestock industry due to import and export restrictions placed by vesicular-stomatitis-free countries and various States within the United States that establish movement restrictions to help prevent any exposure to infected or affected animals. The restrictions vary between the individual States and countries and are based on their specific interests and needs. 26   Current Situation  The index case of the 1997 vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) outbreak, an equine in Cornville, AZ, was confirmed by NVSL on June 5. This outbreak affected Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. The 1997 epizootic is more geographically confined than, but similar in location to, the 1985 epizootic. The 1995 outbreak included Texas and Wyoming as well as the four States currently involved, whereas the 1985 outbreak included only Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The Disease Reporting Unit was activated in Fort Collins, CO, on June 20, 1997. Owing to the progression of the outbreak, the Disease Reporting Unit was relocated to Englewood, CO, on July 14, 1997. As of January 16, 1998, 703 premises had been investigated for vesicular stomatitis with 380 case-positive premises identified: 2 in Arizona, 273 in Colorado, 67 in New Mexico, and 38 in Utah. Table 1 is a summary of investigations outlining the number of closed investigations with negative and positive results, the number of open investigations pending and positive (premises still under quarantine), the total number of investigations and the total positive results and the number of investigations where the agent was isolated by State. This table is accurate up to January 16, 1998.  27   Table 1--VSV investigations in the United States as of January 16, 1998, by number of premises Total investigations 3 2 31 5 372 2 1 5 7 5 2 2 8 3 7 2 2 1 1 6 2 2 1 5 3 104 1 2 2 17 4 2 1 1 3 15 53 6 3 3 6 703 Agent Total isopositive lated 0 0 2 0 273 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 67 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 38 0 0 0 0 380 0 0 1 0 44 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 58  State Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Florida Georgia Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana North Carolina North Dakota Nebraska New Jersey New Mexico Nevada New York Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Virginia Washington Wisconsin Wyoming Totals  Closed Negative Positive 3 2 29 5 99 2 1 5 7 5 2 2 8 3 7 2 2 1 1 6 2 2 1 5 3 37 1 2 2 17 4 2 1 1 3 15 15 6 3 3 6 323 0 0 2 0 273 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 66 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 38 0 0 0 0 379  Open Pending Positive 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  28   Chart 1 is an epidemiologic curve of all affected States beginning the week of May 18, 1997. It illustrates the number of positive premises per week through the week of January 11, 1998. There was a dramatic reduction in positive cases beginning the week of October 19 and decline to zero by the week of November 16.

Quarantines remained in place for 30 days after healing of the last clinical lesion on a premises. The 10- to 20-mile restricted circle requirements used in the 1995 vesicular stomatitis outbreak were found scientifically unwarranted and are no longer used. Immediately following a positive diagnosis of VSV, an epidemiologic investigation was conducted. Most States have implemented temporary restrictions regarding importation of livestock from States affected by vesicular stomatitis. The basic and most common requirement is a statement on the health certificate similar to the following: I have examined the animals listed on this certificate and have found no clinical signs of vesicular stomatitis. To the best of my knowledge, these animals have not been exposed to vesicular stomatitis, nor have they been vaccinated with vesicular stomatitis vaccine within the previous 30 days. Other restrictions implemented by some States include requirements of permits for entry, postentry quarantines, negative VSV tests, bans on livestock from affected premises, and prohibition of VSV-vaccinated animals. International Restrictions--Some international trade restrictions were implemented in response to the diagnosis of vesicular stomatitis in the United States. These restrictions vary from requiring health certificates with statements that the equidae have not been in any State in which vesicular stomatitis has been diagnosed in the previous 6 months to declarations that the equidae have not been in contact with livestock that have been, during the last 30 days, in any State in which vesicular stomatitis has been diagnosed in the previous 6 months. Reporting Communications--The USDAAPHISVS Emergency Programs staff provides a weekly report containing information on new cases, quarantines released, cases closed, virus isolations, and other demographic data. Emergency Programs also continues to report relevant data on VS to the Office International Des Epizooties (OIE). Various informative materials have also been widely distributed, including factsheets on vesicular stomatitis in dairy, beef, equine, and swine, vesicular stomatitis vaccine and a vesicular stomatitis v. foot-and-mouth disease color card. Since the outbreak onset, a weekly conference call has been held with APHIS, State, and Federal officials and industry to discuss issues such as updates, State restrictions, quarantines, laboratory results, and other related concerns. Industry groups that have participated include the American Horse Council, Livestock Marketing Association, National Animal Health Association, National Milk Producers Federation, National Pork Producers Council, and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.  30   No new cases have been reported since the week of November 9, 1997. The Disease Reporting Unit for vesicular stomatitis was closed on December 12, 1997. The last premises under quarantine was released on January 20, 1998. (Authors: Dr. Andrea M.

At this point, Pennsylvania has identified more than a dozen infected flocks in the Lancaster County area. In July 1997, the VS management and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) requested an analysis of potential control options. The objective of this report is to provide decisionmakers with information regarding the relative consequences and costs of various control options. This analysis may be useful in framing the problem and for suggesting areas for further exploration. In the short timeframe for this analysis, we (the APHIS personnel performing this analysis) consulted with the poultry industry, poultry researchers, and USDA's Economic Research Service to obtain best available data. The results in this report apply to the situation as of August 1997.  Methods  We used a state-transition disease model and economic welfare analysis to simulate the results of four different control options. These options are (1) voluntary controls or ""do nothing,""(2) depopulationrepopulation, (3) quarantine and containment, and (4) vaccination with quarantine. Also, we modeled several regionalization and exportrestriction scenarios. Brief descriptions of the models are presented below. Disease-Spread Model--The disease-spread model is an application of statetransition analysis. State-transition analysis involves defining mutually exclusive categories (""states"") into which animals, herds, flocks, and plants can be divided. We used a basic three-state infection model: susceptible, infectious, recovered, or immune. In this analysis the flock was the basic unit of concern. For purposes of the simulation, flocks in the susceptible state were defined as normal, healthy, and available to be infected with AI. Flocks in the infectious state have AI virus circulating among birds and are capable of infecting other flocks. After a flock is infected, it will be immune to reinfection or removed by depopulation, depending on the scenario being modeled. If repopulated, these flocks will return to the susceptible state. Pathways (""transitions"") between the states must also be defined. Pathways are represented mathematically as the probability of moving from one state to another. States and pathways serve as the basis for a series of simulations. These simulations project the spread of a disease or pest over time in hypothetical epidemics and can be used to compare the relative value of different scenarios. Information generated from the disease-spread model is combined with physical impact data such as death or production losses. The resulting output gives an estimate of the biological consequences associated with the disease spread. The economic model then uses the calculated biological consequences as input in estimating the monetary impact on producers and consumers. For this analysis, the area of risk was defined as all Pennsylvania counties affected by the final Federal quarantine in 1984. According to the 1982 census, 468 layer premises (>3,200 birds) were in this area. The model used this number, 468, as the starting number of susceptible flocks. Each hypothetical flock consisted of 70,000 egg-laying chickens. Each egg layer was assumed to produce 270 eggs per year (Pennsylvania Agriculture State Statistics 1996).  32   Flocks move from susceptible to infected to immune and back to susceptible status based on incidence rates, proportion of flocks becoming immune, proportion of susceptible flocks vaccinated, and depopulation to repopulation rates. These proportions were derived by estimating the average waiting time a flock or premises would spend in the infectious or immune states under various control options. Time in the infectious state is the time that a flock would be infected with the virus before it was diagnosed and an action was taken to isolate the flock. Time in immune state is the time a premises is either vacant or the birds on the premises are no longer susceptible to infection through vaccination or natural infection. The original rates of transition were set to approximate the outbreak of 198384. Economic Model--The economic model is an application of economic welfare analysis. Economic welfare analysis evaluates how market prices and quantities adjust to changes in disease control measures. It also measures the effects of disease spread and how consumers and producers are affected by the adjustments in market prices and quantities. The effects on consumers and producers are measured in terms of changes in the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay for products (consumer surplus) plus returns to producers fixed factors of production (producer surplus). For the purpose of this analysis, impact on domestic production was measured in terms of the number of eggs lost owing to disease or depopulation. The analysis examines economic impacts under high and nonpathogenic scenarios and the different control options. Output from the disease-spread model was used to help estimate the number of eggs lost. Export losses were measured in terms of a single aggregate poultry meat. Therefore, the estimated consumer benefit may be somewhat overstated because of differences in consumer preferences for products consumed domestically versus those intended for export. Modeling the differences in consumer preferences is beyond the scope of this analysis. Estimates of regionalized export losses were based on the proportion of total broiler production in each State. This proportion was applied to estimates of the U.S. impact if poultry meat exports were eliminated entirely. If a regionalization strategy is implemented, multi-State poultry companies may be able to alter their distribution channels, minimizing the adverse effects of export restrictions in a given region. The level to which these adverse effects can be minimized is unknown at this time. If an acceptable regionalization strategy cannot be established, the full impact of any export bans would be felt. Disease Control Scenarios -- S everal scenarios were developed to examine the costs and benefits of alternative control options. The scenarios were evaluated using computer simulation models described above. The scenarios were modeled over a 21-week period starting with one infected flock. The following is a description of each scenario and assumptions.  33   1. Voluntary Control or ""Do Nothing"" Approach -- A fter consulting with the PDA, we considered the do-nothing approach an infeasible option and we did not model its impacts. The main reason was that, if, in 1997, PDA had not imposed quarantines and restricted poultry and poultry product movement, spread of infection could have been substantial. Other reasons are discussed below.  This scenario would assume that neither State nor Federal authorities will take any steps to contain or control the situation. Because of the traffic in feed, feed ingredients, service personnel, maintenance personnel, vaccination, placement, and catch crews, infection among flocks could be expected to spread rapidly within the State.  Without local control, AI would likely be transported out of the State into surrounding areas. Large poultry-producing States nearest Pennsylvania-- s pecifically the Delaware, Maryland, Virginia (Delmarva) region -- w ould likely be the first areas affected. We understand that some of the layer flocks in Maryland share common feed company sources and vaccination crews with the currently affected area in Pennsylvania. Feed and feed ingredient trucks serving flocks within the current quarantine area also serve broiler flocks in the Delmarva region. The estimated value of the broiler and support industries on the Delmarva is $1.5 billion. Pennsylvania's poultry industry is valued at $563.5 million. Virginia produces $773 million worth of poultry and poultry products yearly, and many of their producers have direct ties and traffic with North Carolina.  If Pennsylvania did not quarantine the affected area, neighboring States could impose embargoes on poultry and poultry products moving from Pennsylvania. Placement of embargoes might send an unintended message to our international trading partners, potentially resulting in trade restrictions.  Producers lack the authority to impose and enforce quarantine zones and movement controls. When nonpathogenic AI was identified in commercial layer flocks in Lancaster County, the industry requested that a quarantine be placed around an area approximating a 5-mile radius from the first positive flock. In 198384 and during the current situation, the PDA was able to enlist the Pennsylvania State Police to enforce the quarantine zone. Establishment of this quarantine zone provides reassurance to surrounding States and industry.  2. Depopulation Scenario -- F or this scenario, flocks were moved from the infectious to the depopulated or removed state after 1 week. This assumption was based on experience in the 1983  8 4 outbreak, when active surveillance was devised to sample flocks on a weekly basis. In 1983, flock owners were instructed to place recently dead birds in containers near the road. State or Federal personnel collected tracheal and cloacal swabs from these birds. The swabs were tested for evidence of virus. Collection personnel established a daily route allowing them to cover a large area while sampling many flocks. The routine was repeated the following week, providing a weekly test record for each flock in the quarantine zone (referred to as ""dead bird pickup""). Upon detection of disease in a flock, a quarantine was implemented immediately to prevent movement of the virus off the premises. Thus, from the time a flock entered the infectious state until quarantine was generally not more than 1 week. 34   In 1983  8 4, the offer of indemnity payment also encouraged owners to report illness as early as possible. Producers were paid only for the live birds on the premises at the time of field diagnosis and quarantine. With the highly pathogenic AI virus it would not be uncommon for an owner to experience several thousand bird deaths in a single day. The owner could expect no compensation for losses that occurred before the quarantine and diagnosis. This setup encouraged early reporting because doing so would provide maximum compensation from the authorities. If the flock owner did not contact authorities, dead-bird pickup would likely identify the infected flock within a 7day window. We assumed that placement of the quarantine effectively removes the flock from infected status and places it into the immune status, where it no longer poses a risk for other susceptible flocks. In 1983  8 4, an infected flock was quarantined at the time of field diagnosis. Soon after that, birds were destroyed. After depopulation there was an obligatory downtime during which the premises were cleaned and disinfected. Flock houses were sampled and must have tested negative on two tests, a minimum of 30 days apart, before restocking. The final laboratory report releasing the premises from quarantine took a minimum of 14 days after the last sampling. At this time the premises were eligible for restocking with new, susceptible egg-laying chickens. Considering the preceding discussion, we assumed it would require a minimum of 45 days to complete the necessary testing to reach the point of repopulation. Therefore, theoretical repopulation of flocks occurred 7 weeks after diagnosis. Also, because of the imperfections of the laboratory tests and the necessary downtime for removing manure, repairing the caging and electrical systems within a house, and so on, we further assumed that only 10 percent of the potentially eligible houses would be repopulated after 7 weeks. Beginning in the eighth week, 10 percent of the houses found infected in Week 1 moved to the susceptible category. In the ninth week, 10 percent of the flocks diagnosed in weeks 1 and 2 were repopulated and moved into the susceptible category.  3. Quarantine and Containment of Infected Flocks -- We assumed that positive commercial flocks are detected fairly quickly with the dead-bird pick up procedure discussed above. The average time the birds were infected and remained infectious was again assumed to be 1 week. In this scenario, some flocks would become naturally infected and remain immune for life. The time in immune state was set at 52 weeks, meaning flocks do not reenter the susceptible state through the duration of the simulated outbreak. Flocks infected with highly pathogenic AI in 1983  8 4 lost their table-egg market because the eggs were destroyed along with the birds during the depopulation. Flocks infected in the current nonpathogenic AI outbreak may similarly experience production (morbidity and mortality) losses. Under the plan currently in place in Pennsylvania, eggs from infected flocks are diverted to an instate pasteurization plant. Infected flocks were released from quarantine when the flock no longer exhibited clinical signs and was negative on two tests (30 days apart) for AI. Flock owners are then permitted to reenter the table-egg market; therefore, infected flocks lose their table-egg market only for a short period. However, if this pasteurization market 35   becomes saturated, flock owners may be unable to recoup any salvage value for their eggs, thus significantly increasing their cost.  4. Vaccination with Quarantine -- Research has shown that clinical signs and production losses can be mitigated by use of vaccine. However, research also shows that vaccinated birds can become infected with field strain virus. Vaccinated birds or flocks can be expected to shed less virus, to develop less severe clinical signs, and to experience fewer production losses than unvaccinated birds or flocks. Some of the literature notes a 12 log-factor decrease in the amount of virus shed by experimentally challenged vaccinated birds. The vaccination scenario was simulated by vaccinating 60 flocks (assuming 70,000 birds per flock) over the initial 4-week period. This is approximately the number of flocks capable of being vaccinated once with the 4 million doses of vaccine ordered by PDA. The key parameter for vaccine use is its efficacy in reducing flock-to-flock transmission of field virus. We are not aware of any research or data on this topic. In the absence of this information, and for example purposes, we simulated four levels of vaccine efficacy: 0 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent. These levels were implemented in the model by starting with varying numbers of flocks in the immune state, assuming that 1 million birds per week will be vaccinated. For example, the 75 percent effective scenario starts with 45 (60  0.75) flocks in the immune state during the first 4 weeks of the simulation. In Pennsylvania, there is a current proposal to place unvaccinated sentinel chickens in vaccinated flocks. These sentinel birds will be tested regularly to determine if field strain virus has entered the flock. If there is evidence of infection, the flock will be treated as an infected flock. When a vaccinated flock is found infected with field strain virus, it will be managed as any other infected flock. Eggs will be diverted to pasteurization if there is market available. Therefore, we modeled the economic impacts with and without total loss of table and pasteurization egg markets. Vaccinated flocks or naturally infected were assumed to be immune for the remaining flock life. We assumed quarantine was effective in reducing flock spread and set the model for only 1 week's waiting time in the infectious state to match the other scenarios. Results -- The simulated number of infected flocks and economic impact of ""quarantine only"" compared with ""quarantine with depopulation"" are shown in table 1 for highly pathogenic and nonpathogenic AI. Figure 1 shows the course of the simulated epidemics compared with the actual for 198384. The morbidity and mortality (M&M) impacts for the nonpathogenic scenarios are based on data provided by PDA for the current outbreak. For nonpathogenic AI, the economic losses are shown with and without total loss of table and pasteurization egg markets. For the quarantine and vaccination scenarios, any morbidity and mortality occurring during the time of flock quarantine were included in the market loss calculation.  36   Table 1--Simulated number of AI-infected flocks and economic impact of quarantine and depopulation control options in Pennsylvania layer flocks  (N = 468 at-risk flocks [>3,200 birds] in the 1983  8 4 quarantine zone)a Quarantine only Time in infectious state Time in immune state Number of infected flocks 1 week b,c  Depopulation and quarantine 1 weekb,c 7 weeks, 10% exit each week after 281  52 weeks 262  Losses for highly pathogenic AI ($ million) Producer loss Consumer loss Net loss $17.2 plus export impacts $55.6 plus export impacts $72.8e plus export impacts $27.2 plus export impacts $89.6 plus export impacts $117.4e plus export impacts  d  d  d  d  d  d  Losses for nonpathogenic AI ($ million) M&Mf / M&M plus Market Loss  g  Producer loss $4.0 / $17.2 $27.2h Consumer loss $13.1 / $55.6 $89.6 Net loss $17.1 / $72.8e $117.4e _________________________________________________________________________ a  Under the depopulation option, incidence rate and number of flocks infected were based on the 1983  84 Pennsylvania outbreak. b c  Assumes early detection procedures.

Four different potential regionalization scenarios are shown. For the purpose of this evaluation, the estimated impacts of these scenarios were based on the total impact to the United States due to a complete loss of poultry meat exports weighted by the proportion of broiler production occurring in each region. Note that these losses are on an annual basis, and export restrictions are expected to last more than 1 year.  Table 3--Projected annuala export losses if Pennsylvania (PA) uses AI vaccination or the virus converts to Highly Pathogenic under four potential regionalization scenarios (in millions of dollars) PA + Delmarva $166.5 $154.0 $ 12.4 PA + Delmarva + S.E.

It is likely that, should Pennsylvania be embargoed, production from other States can be shifted to fill that market, decreasing the loss. c  Restrictions on exports of poultry in a highly pathogenic AI situation yield consumer gains because the supply of domestic poultry in the marketplace goes up drastically, causing retail prices for chicken to fall.  Discussion  This analysis focused on the disease production impacts in commercial layer operation, as well as potential impacts in the export markets for U.S. poultry meat. We looked for benefit of vaccine use in three areas: (1) reducing producer losses, (2) decreasing the likelihood of conversion to highly pathogenic virus, and (3) decreasing the number of number of infected flocks. Compared with the high cost of potential export market loss, the benefits appear minimal. The efficacy of vaccine at reducing flock-to-flock spread is the key variable affecting the outcome of this analysis. No data were available on this topic. However, there is agreement in the literature and expert opinion that vaccination will not prevent the circulation of field virus among flocks. Vaccination will reduce the amount of virus shed from field-strain-infected birds. The impact of this reduction on the probability of flock-to-flock spread is expected to be slight because of the large amount of virus excreted by 70,000 vaccinated birds. We had planned to model the likelihood of the virus converting from nonpathogenic to highly pathogenic. Instead, we estimated  39   economic impacts for high and nonpathogenic scenarios without assigning probabilities. We could find no data applicable to the probability of conversion for individual birds or flocks. If vaccination decreases the number of birds infected, it may decrease the number of opportunities for random molecular changes in the virus. The mechanism that triggers conversion is currently unknown. Also, experts generally feel that the H7N2 virus in Pennsylvania is stable and unlikely to convert to a highly pathogenic strain. This opinion suggests that vaccine use would have little impact on the emergence of highly pathogenic AI. The time a flock spends in the infectious state is a critical variable because it affects the number of flocks that can spread disease at any one time. According to field experience and expert opinion, flocks stay infectious for an average of 4 weeks. However, the time flocks spend in the infectious state was set to 1 week for all scenarios. This assumption allows us to examine the impact of depopulation and vaccine efficacy without an added variable. (Authors: Dr. H.

Claws had also sloughed. His was a midsized farm with about 2,000 hogs, and that sow was in the middle of the farrowing house. The farm was operated by the farmer and his wife, and no animals had been introduced onto the farm in the last month. No people other than the farmer and his wife had entered the farrowing house in the past several weeks. The management was considered to be good but sparrows did fly in and out of the animal buildings. Morbidity in the subsequently infected herd was very high, and the mortality in young stock neared 100 percent.  Clinical Disease  The incubation period was short and appeared to be approximately 1 to 4 days. Only swine were affected. The disease was characterized by vesicles on the feet, snout, teats and tongue. Vesicles were commonly observed on the snout, and it was not uncommon to examine several hundred pigs from several pens and observe fluid-filled vesicles on their snouts. The vesicular fluid was clear to slightly cloudy. Vesicles were commonly observed on the teats. Many of the vesicles on the feet had ruptured, leaving raw, hemorrhagic, ulcerated lesions around the coronary band, between the claws, and on the soles. Sloughed claws, were very common, as were abortions. Adults very quickly became emaciated because their feet were so sore they would not move to eat or drink. Morbidity often reached 100 percent in adults and piglets. Neonatal mortality was commonly associated with acute myocarditis and malnutrition and related to other undiagnosed unthrifty conditions in neonates.  Laboratory  Specimens were collected from the index farm on March 14, 1997, and sent to the Taiwan Provincial Research Institute for Animal Health in Tanshui, Taiwan. Laboratory workup was completed over the weekend, and all other swine diseases were excluded. The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) diagnostic kit was opened, and on March 19 a diagnosis of FMD was tentatively confirmed as types O1 and Asia 1. On March 20, 1997, OIE was notified of the outbreak. Samples from Taiwan were sent to the OIE/World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, UK, for further evaluation. Employing indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cell-culture techniques, the Laboratory identified FMD type O. To determine if the Taiwan strain was naturally adapted to swine, various experiments were initiated at the Laboratory. Experimental pigs inoculated with the Taiwan FMD isolate became ill with generalized FMD. Four normal pigs and four normal cattle were placed in contact with the FMD pigs for 2 hours. The contact-exposed pigs developed generalized FMD. The contact-exposed cattle remained normal. Further animal studies at the Laboratory indicated that the Taiwan FMD isolates are naturally adapted to pigs and are considered porcinophilic strains of FMD.  41   Epidemiology  FMD disease was previously diagnosed in Taiwan in 1913  14 and again in 192429. The exact mode of entry remains unknown for the 1997 outbreak. This information may become available after exhaustive epidemiologic studies. The disease may have entered Taiwan via (1) smuggling of live pigs, (2) smuggling of pig meat products, (3) legal importation of live pigs, (4) legal importing of pig meat products, (5) smuggling of animal biologics, (6) legal importing of animal biologics, (7) legal and illegal moving of people, or (8) intentionally introducing the disease agent. Although the laboratory diagnosis was being made on the index farm in Hsinchu Prefecture, clinical cases of an FMD-like disease were being found on hog farms in Tainan and Pingtung Prefectures, about 200300 km south of the index farm. This fact suggests that FMD was present in Taiwan long before the official date of March 20, 1997. Currently, however, there is no scientific information available to support that hypothesis. The index farm was also located near a port city that was well known for the smuggling of pigs, especially the black-skinned pigs, which are highly valued by many local markets. The index farm was also situated near legal and illegal slaughterhouses. On March 17, FMD was clinically diagnosed on a second hog farm in the Hsinchu Prefecture. On March 18, FMD was also diagnosed on a hog farm in the Prefecture of Taoyuan, bringing the number of affected farms to three. Unfounded comments have suggested that when FMD was diagnosed on the index farm, the disease was also present on 2530 other hog farms. During March 1997 and the preceding several months, Taiwan had initiated a control and eradication program for hog cholera that included the collection of at least 100,000 blood samples from 17 livestock disease control centers around the island. In a recent preliminary study to determine any prior serologic evidence of FMD, approximately 550 samples were tested in April and May 1997, and all were negative for FMD. Japan and Taiwan for present on is currently South Korea set February 21, 1997, as the official date of FMD infection in import reasons. Comments and news articles suggest that FMD was the island as early as October 1996 or in the late summer of 1996. There no scientific evidence to support this conclusion.  Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD)  SVD is well recognized in Taiwan. It is characterized by vesicular lesions on the snout, teats, and feet, including the interdigital space. SVD is clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases, especially FMD. Reports from Taiwan suggest that SVD can easily be easily recognized based on clinical lesions and that laboratories were not routinely employed to diagnose SVD. It is very possible, on the basis of this reliable information, that early cases of FMD may have been misdiagnosed as SVD. Serologic evidence of SVD was detected at the World Reference Laboratory.  42   FMD moved very rapidly throughout Taiwan, as the data indicate. For example, on March 20, 70 farms were officially infected. Within 8 days, 1,175 farms were infected. The disease appeared to infect an additional 200  300 farms per day. At the moment, no explanation can be given to account for the lightninglike speed at which this disease moved throughout the island. FMD infection in Taiwan was confined to swine despite observations of cattle and other small ruminants in very close proximity to infected hogs. No infection was ever reported in other species, including zoo animals. Therefore, contributing factors to the introduction and very rapid spread of FMD in Taiwan have been associated with (1) very high swine density (Taiwan has been reported to have the world's highest density of hog farms), (2) garbage feeding, (3) hog farms located in close proximity to slaughterhouses, (4) the absence of a vaccination program (although the disease has been absent for almost 70 years), (5) frequent social farm visits, and (6) lack of complete laboratory confirmation of vesicular diseases. Figures available as of June 17, 1997, indicated that 6,144 farms were affected, involving 1,011,421 FMD-infected pigs, 184,231 dead pigs, and 3,850,536 pigs killed. Depopulation and Disposal--Immediate steps to be taken on an FMD-infected farm include the following:  Stop shipping pigs immediately.  Kill all infected pigs.  Spread lime around infected areas and hallways.  Spread alkali flakes in sewage around pens and sterilize pigpens with a strong acid or alkali solution.  Strictly control infected areas.  Consider adding organic acid to the hog drinking water.  Vaccinate as soon as possible. The proper and rapid depopulation and disposal of millions of hogs can present grave economic, manpower, animal care, and environmental challenges. The speed and efficiency of depopulation are directly related to the speed and efficiency of disposal. Very high water tables and other environmental concerns in Taiwan complicated these procedures. Electrocution was the means of choice for depopulation. The disposal methods were dependent upon local and regional conditions, including EPA regulations. Once EPA officials formulated their burial, incineration, and rendering procedures, depopulation and disposal continued at a smooth pace. Because of the immensity of the task, there was an initial lack of supplies, equipment, and manpower that caused a significant delay in the prompt and timely depopulation and disposal of infected pigs. The military made a substantial contribution toward manpower needs in the area of depopulation and disposal. The military recorded  43   50,732 military person-days and the use of 3,277 military vehicles. Many stressrelated problems were evidenced in the military recruits working on this detail. Some military conscripts employed in depopulation activities reported problems associated with psychological distress and anxiety requiring medical leave. This is most understandable, if one considers the magnitude of the depopulation and disposal effort. When military recruits completed their tour of duty, they returned to the barracks for a 10-day quarantine period. A peak depopulation capacity of 200,000 hogs per day was achieved. The delay in depopulation posed a serious problem because the longer an infected hog farm remained intact, the greater the opportunity for spread of the FMD virus through the air, fomites, and animal and people traffic became. This must also be evaluated in view of the very high density of hog farms in Taiwan, where one can stand on a main road or backroad in Pingtung Prefecture (a very high-density Prefecture) and identify numerous pig farms (10) located about 200  3 00 m apart along a severalkm stretch of road. Indemnity--Much of the information provided to APHIS requires translation which was not available at this writing. Farmers could apply to their livestock disease control center or local agriculture office for indemnity payment for FMD-infected hogs. The indemnity price was based on production costs set at New Taiwan Dollars (NTD)$2,400 for a 100-kg pig and NTD$350 for pigs less than 25 kg. For registered breeding stock, the indemnity price was set at NTD$4,800. Initially, this indemnity price was very high and significantly more than that for a healthy pig, which caused some farmers to collect and introduce FMD-infected pigs to their uninfected farms. This would enable them to collect the much higher indemnity price for the FMDinfected pigs. This disparity was quickly rectified. Disposal plans called for the burial in large municipal landfills of approximately 80 percent of the hogs. Fifteen percent were rendered, and percent were burned. Burning consisted of open burn and incineration. A capacity of approximately 200,000 pig carcasses per day was achieved. In water resource protection areas, only incineration or open burning was used. On April 11, 11 industrial portable kerosene incinerators arrived in Taiwan. The capacity of the incinerators was 2.5 or 40 metric tons (t) per day. A day represented 24 hours of operation. One site visited in Pingtung Prefecture contained several 2.5- and 40-t incinerators surrounded by telephone poles with floodlights for aroundthe-clock operation. It would require several 24-hour days of operation to complete disposal on most of the farms visited. Vaccination--Animal disease emergency planning procedures in place in Taiwan for many years included the maintenance of an FMD vaccine bank. The emergency planning procedures also involved the completion of several FMD test exercises over the past several years. At the outset of the epidemic, 40,000 doses of trivalent FMD vaccine (O1, A24, Asia 1) were in the repository. This vaccine was immediately dispersed to the east side of the 44   island and elsewhere to vaccinate all susceptible zoo animals and valuable hogbreeding stock. Because of a preliminary FMD diagnosis of both O and Asia, an order for a bivalent vaccine was placed. The bivalent vaccine (O1 and Asia 1) of approximately 526,000 doses arrived on March 26 and 27. This vaccine was immediately disbursed free of charge for islandwide use. In mid-March, officials purchased 3 million doses of a bivalent vaccine, O and Asia, to be used on the eastern side of the island in valuable zoo animals and hog-breeding farms. A significant portion of the vaccine was given free to small farmers. To prevent the spread of the disease by vaccination crews, trained, experienced farmers under veterinary supervision were permitted to administer the vaccine. An order for 13 million doses of a monovalent FMD vaccine O was received on May 3, 1997, and distributed free of charge to farmers. Initially, all FMD-infected hogs were destroyed. When enough vaccine became available, all pigs (including those with the disease) were vaccinated. About 1721 million doses of vaccine were administered. Additional material on vaccination is in the process of translation. Cleaning and Disinfection--The cleaning and disinfection process is one of the most critical and essential aspects of recovery after an FMD epidemic. Various protocols for these procedures were supplied by the local livestock disease control Centers, other government agencies, livestock journals, and private industry. These procedures included the standard textbook sterilization disinfectants used against the FMD virus. Onfarm procedures included scrubbing and spraying with disinfectant twice a week. Large tonnages of New Formula Farm Fluid, Farm Fluid S, and Virkon S were airlifted to Taiwan as needed. The Japanese Pig Producers also donated disinfectant. Abundant material is available on this subject matter but requires translation. Restocking--A five-step FMD. Step I, ii stipulates cases of FMD in a month slaughter are required to of FMD in 2 weeks. procedure was initiated to restock hog farms infected with that farms applying for reintroduction must have no reported within 6 km of their surroundings. Farms with only partial have two doses of FMD vaccinations and no reported cases  Other pertinent points include part III, number 3, which states that applicants must hire inhouse or contract a veterinarian to be in charge of health management and disease reporting for the farm. Part III, number 4 states that reintroduced pigs must come from FMD-free farms, must weigh more than 25 kg, and must be effectively vaccinated against FMD and hog cholera. Part III, Environmental Protection Regulations, is quite specific and pertains mostly to wastewater pollution control and waste disposal. Part V addresses violations and includes fines up to NTD$150,000 for reintroducing pigs without permission. In addition, no compensation will be given if farms are reinfected with FMD or any other serious disease. Increased surveillance of actions likely to pollute rivers and the environment was included.  45   The Agriculture Sector in Taiwan  Taiwan's major agricultural commodities are hogs, rice, poultry, shrimp, eels, squid, tuna, sugar, and bananas. In 1996, agricultural exports were worth approximately U.S.$5.48 billion and represented nearly 5 percent of Taiwan's total exports. Exports of live animals and poultry, frozen meat, and pork chops comprised 29 percent of total agricultural exports (U.S.$1.61 billion). Japan has been Taiwan's principal market for agricultural exports (57 percent of total agricultural exports), followed by Hong Kong (20 percent) and the United States (7 percent). The livestock sector in Taiwan has seen sharp growth in production in the last several decades. Meat output increased tenfold from 1952 to the early 1990's. By the mid1990's, livestock accounted for over a third of the total value of Taiwan's agricultural production. The two leading livestock sectors in Taiwan are the hog and poultry sectors. Taiwan is self-sufficient in poultry production and exceeds domestic needs in hog production. Taiwan has small cattle and dairy industries (over 90 percent of the country's beef needs are met through imports).  Taiwan's Swine Industry Prior to the Outbreak  Before the FMD outbreak, hog production was the leading agricultural product in Taiwan, and was worth U.S.$2.6 million in 1994, which was well above the value of the rice (U.S.$1.5 million) and poultry (U.S.$1.1 million) industries. More than 14 million swine were slaughtered in both 1995 and 1996, yielding more than 1 million t of product each year. Pork, the preferred meat in Taiwan, accounts for about 60 percent of total meat consumption. Per-capita consumption averaged 37 kg in 1991. Because Taiwanese consumers prefer fresh pork, hogs for domestic consumption are typically slaughtered at night and sold in wet markets the following day. Before to the outbreak, about 20 processing plants provided meat for the domestic market. Hogs move from the farm to slaughter via auction markets. In the auction markets, hogs are sold individually. The auctions run on a daily basis with a relatively small daily volume of sales. A small but growing percentage of hogs (22 percent in 1991) are raised under contract and go directly from the farm to the packing plant. Exports have been important to the Taiwanese swine industry. Prior to the outbreak, nearly 40 percent of the hogs destined in Taiwan were raised for the export market, and exports were worth U.S.$1.5 billion. (The USDA'S National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that only 3 percent of total U.S. pork production is exported.) Meat products constitute the majority of Taiwanese exports and totaled nearly 270,000 t in 1995 and 1996. Most of these exports were shipped to Japan, where Taiwan captured 44 percent of the market in 1996. Exports of fresh, chilled pork had been increasing, reaching nearly 40 percent of total exports by the mid-1990's. Before the FMD outbreak there were approximately 20 processing plants in Taiwan of export quality (i.e., they met the standards and requirements set by Japan). In addition to meat products, several thousand live swine were exported annually before the outbreak.  46   Taiwan was among the top 15 producers of pork and pork products worldwide in 1996. Approximately 270,000 t of pork products were exported from Taiwan in 1995 and 1996, leading to Taiwan's status as the third largest exporter of pork products worldwide. Most of these exports were sent to Japan. Hog production in Taiwan developed during the last 3 decades from a sideline farm activity to a major enterprise. By 1995, the number of hog farms with more than 1,000 head jumped to 9 percent of all hog farms, whereas those farms with fewer than 200 head dropped to 65 percent of the total. Hog density in Taiwan is extremely high. Eighty-three percent of the hog population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country. Swine density is approximately 6,500 hogs/mi2 there. By comparison, in Sampson County, NC (one of the top swine-producing counties in the United States), swine density is approximately 1,800 hogs/mi2. Because of the high concentration of hogs in Taiwan, hog waste and environmental pollution have been a problem. Water quality regulations have been adopted in recent years, and efforts have been made to implement onfarm manure treatment. By 1993, 86 percent of farms had implemented manure treatment regimens. A controversial plan prepared in 1991 called for the end of pork exports to reduce the size of the hog herd to better match environmental carrying capacity. This plan was not enacted. To support the development of the livestock sector, the Taiwanese Government operates an integrated disease-prevention system, including an inspection system for imported meat. In addition, the government oversees the production and use of veterinary medication. Routine monitoring of the livestock population is also carried out. In the 1990 ""Council of Agriculture Yearbook,"" Taiwan considered itself free of FMD, rinderpest, and African swine fever. Prior to the 1997 FMD outbreak, hog cholera and pseudorabies were the major diseases of concern to hog producers, and Taiwan had been working toward the eradication of hog cholera.  Economic Impacts of the Outbreak  The most significant economic impacts of the FMD outbreak will be those related to the loss of export markets, particularly the fresh pork market in Japan, possibly for as many as 4 to 5 years. Because nearly 40 percent of the hog population was raised to meet export demand, significant structural impacts will take place to adjust production to a new market carrying capacity. It is too early to tell what these adjustments will be. Indications are, however, that prices will be more unstable and that farms and processors will leave the market. Within 1 week of the outbreak, hog prices had dropped 60 percent, falling from NTD$4,500 per 100 kg (about U.S.$167) to NTD$1,700 per 100 kg (about U.S.$63). These price decreases resulted from the immediate loss of export markets and an initial sharp drop in domestic consumption. With hog production costs estimated at NTD$4,100 per 100 kg (about U.S.$152), even farms without FMD infection were affected. 47   Hog prices rebounded, regaining preoutbreak levels by mid-May. To encourage pig prices to recover, the Taiwanese Government provided low-interest loans and storage subsidies. A survey taken in Taiwan in July showed higher-than-expected hog numbers, which resulted in another drop in hog prices in late August and early September. At that time, prices fell again to NTD$3,000 per 100 kg (approximately U.S.$111). The Taiwanese Government conducted a survey in July showing a total of 21,891 swine farms nationwide, which represented a decrease of 14 percent from the 25,357 reported in November 1996. In addition, the survey indicated a total of 8,533,476 pigs on these farms, which was down 20 percent from November 1996 (10,698,366 pigs). A standing herd of 7 million pigs is seen as sufficient to meet the needs of the domestic market. Numbers in excess of 7 million are likely to put downward pressure on prices. Production estimates for 1997 suggest an annual hog slaughter of 11.7 million head, which is a decline of 20 percent from the 1996 level of 14.6 million head. Taiwan's processing capacity has fallen. After the outbreak, seven of the meat packers exporting to Japan closed or downsized, including a plant run by Cargill. Early estimates released in March suggested that as many as 50,000 persons might become unemployed as a result of the outbreak. These same early estimates projected the impact on swine-related industries at U.S.$6.9 billion. The Taiwanese Government's goal is to have no additional FMD outbreaks from July 1997 through June 1998. Taiwan then hopes to reach FMD-free-with-immunization status by June 2000. From July 2000 to June 2001, Taiwan intends to eradicate FMD and reach FMD-free-without-immunization status. To meet these goals, regulations controlling repopulation efforts were issued and farmers were allowed to begin restocking in July. Under these regulations, farmers will need to apply for a permit to be allowed to restock. Conditions for the permit include ensuring that the farmer has disinfected his or her premises, that the farm has a contract with a veterinarian, and that the farm is equipped with wastewater and wastedisposal devices. Owing to new regulations regarding watershed areas, permits may not be issued for farms located in fragile watershed districts. Indications are that farmers began restocking herds prior to July in response to good hog prices. Taiwan's export market will be affected for many years. Japanese import requirements prohibit unprocessed pork being imported from an area infected with FMD unless the disease has been eradicated and vaccines have not been used for at least 2 years. These requirements may exclude Taiwan from the Japanese fresh pork market for at least 5 years. Taiwanese officials are negotiating with Japan regarding the possibility of Japan accepting processed pork such as hams, sausages, and similar products. It was unlikely that such exports would occur in 1997. The United States, Denmark, and Canada have replaced Taiwan in the Japanese market. Exports of pork from the United States to Japan are projected to total 185,000 t in 1997 compared with 142,000 t in 1996. About 93,000 t of U.S. exports are projected to be chilled pork, which is increase from 77,000 t in 1996. 48   Exports from Denmark are projected at 135,000 t in 1997, which is up from 119,000 t in 1996, whereas exports from Canada are projected to increase from 39,000 t in 1996 to 55,000 t in 1997. The U.S. share of the Japanese market is expected to grow from 22 to 40 percent by 1998.  Sources of Information  Taiwan Ag Info Center, Web site.

The disease spread rapidly with high mortality. A vaccination program was developed using both the Minnesota and Chinese strains of the virus. High mortality was associated with the Minnesota strain because no neutralizing sera were used with the vaccine. Vaccine with the Chinese strain was donated by a private French group. Approximately 50 percent of the swine population may have been vaccinated in Haiti. The first positive serology on the other end of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic, was reported in March 1997. Viral antigen was detected in June 1997. These early detections were found near the border with Haiti.  Chronology  In November 1996, the Dominican Republic received official notification that several HC outbreaks had occurred in Haiti. This prompted the Dominican Ministry of Agriculture to initiate an HC epidemiologic surveillance program. In March 1997, 8 of 29 samples submitted to the Central Veterinary Laboratory were seropositive for HC. The seropositive samples were from Hondo Valle, Elas Pia Province, and originated from two separate locations. The positive samples were sent to NVSL for (BVD) differentiation. On May 7, 1997, one of nine samples from the Elas Pia Province was tissue positive for HC. This sample came from a dying animal, which was one of the eight positive pigs found in March. In June 1997, 6 of 115 samples submitted were seropositive. Five of the six cases came from the northwestern part of the country. Tissues were collected from two of these cases and were positive on ABCAP for HC antigens. Ministry records indicate that at least three of these five animals were found to be seropositive on June 12, 1996, in the community of Mariano Cestero, Municipio de Restauracin, Province of Dajabn. The sixth seropositive animal came from Las Matas de Farfan, San Juan Province. In July 1997, 19 of 69 cases were seropositive. Two of the 19 samples came from a kill plant in the National District Province. Traceback on these two cases was not conclusive. The other 17 seropositive cases were from the Province of Elas Pia (34 submitted). In mid-July 1997, the entire pig population of the Elas Pia Province was depopulated. A 20-km hog-free zone was thus formed along a portion of the Haitian border. The depopulation operation was carried out the last 2 weeks of July, but stragglers continued to be sacrificed through mid-October. A total of 6,412 pigs were sacrificed from the Elas Pia Province. In August 1997, 13 of 761 samples were seropositive. Four seropositive samples came from San Cristobal, San Cristobal Province. Five seropositive samples came from Neiba, Bahoruco Province (86 submitted), and four seropositive samples came from various areas in the Province of Valverde (257 submitted).  51   In September 1997, 18 samples of 1,031 submitted to the central laboratory were seropositive. Eight of 11 tissue samples submitted were positive for viral antigens. In the National District Province, seven samples were seropositive (77 submitted), and two tissue samples were positive (4 submitted). In the Northwest Region: one seropositive case was submitted from Mato Nuevo, Mao, Province of Valverde (70 submitted), and one seropositive sample from the Dajabn area (32 submitted). The southern region of the country had nine seropositive samples. Six seropositive samples were from Neiba, Province of Bahoruco (95 submitted). One seropositive sample was submitted from Polo, Barahona Province (18 submitted). Finally, two seropositive samples were submitted from Duverg, Independencia province (20 submitted). From August 14 to September 23, a total of 77 were sacrificed, burned, and buried in Neiba to try and stop the spread of the disease. In October 1997 (exclusive of October 31 data), 47 samples of 1,131 samples submitted to the central laboratory were seropositive. Fourteen of 42 tissue samples submitted were positive (the total number of tissues submitted is not accurate because ""single-owner lot samples"" from slaughterhouses were counted and processed as one tissue sample. A more accurate estimate of total tissue samples submitted would be 80). See tables 1 and 2. Approximately 300 pigs were depopulated from Bavaro, La Altagracia Province, by mid-October. Ninety-nine pigs were sacrificed from the Villa Mella Barrio, National District Province on October 24 and 25, 1997. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the HCpositive tissue (14) and serum samples (47) and their sources throughout the Dominican Republic in the first 30 days of October 1997.

USDA Intervention  The Dominican Republic contacted USDA on August 27, 1997, for technical assistance and equipment. Since the first serologic evidence of this outbreak was found in March 1997, APHIS had several other representatives in the Dominican Republic before this action team. We have examined the methods of pig farming and marketing and the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture in its campaign to control and eradicate HC. In addition, assistance has continually been provided by various means. Several APHIS personnel have been to the Dominican Republic, on permanent assignment or detailed as consultants, to provide technical support and expertise: Permanent Assignment Osvaldo Perez, International Services, Dominican Republic Consultants Jose Diez--VS, Area Veterinarian-in-Charge, Puerto Rico Douglas Gregg--VS, veterinary medical officer, Foreign Animal Disease Timothy Deveau--VS, veterinary medical officer, Wisconsin A.

The severity of the syndrome and the current clinical picture mirror that of the original porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) when it first hit the United States in 1989. For this reason, the syndrome was named acute PRRS. If this disease continues to spread, the pork industry will experience significant economic losses. Should acute PRRS reach the same level of herd infection as original PRRS, producer surplus would decrease by $583 million per year. Consumer surplus would decrease by $121 million per year. In the United States, direct losses due to conventional PRRS (cPRRS) have ranged from $50 to $250 per sow in the herd. Data from the National Animal Health Management Study's Swine '95 study showed that 68.5 percent of hog operations had cPRRS virus on the premises in 1995. Also, the hog and pork export market is severely threatened by the existence and spread of any undefined pathogen. The pork industry and the U.S. Government have responded aggressively to this new emerging disease problem. NVSL and the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) in Ames, IA, and other veterinary diagnostic laboratories have begun diagnostic and research efforts directed toward understanding acute PRRS. In December 1996, the National Pork Producers Council and the American Association of Swine Practitioners called upon VS to help investigate the epidemiology of acute PRRS. During the week of December 1620, 1996, APHISVS sent an early response team to southeastern Iowa to conduct an investigation of acute PRRS. The team investigated operations where swine were experiencing acute PRRS and operations that had not reported acute PRRS. The team's analysis suggests that clinical signs and laboratory findings in affected herds were consistent with conventional PRRS as initially defined in the United States in 1989 and 1990. The PRRS virus was isolated from some premises. The team did not identify risk factors for increased abortions and deaths in the area. On December 24, 1996, the American Association of Swine Practitioners surveyed its members to estimate the number of acute PRRS-affected swine herds in the United States and Canada over the previous 15 months. Affected herds were defined as those with (1) acute onset, (2) clinical signs over a 2- to 4-week period, (3) high mortality (>5 percent) in sows and boars, and (4) high rates of abortion (>10 percent) occurring in all stages of parity and gestation (Zimmerman et al. 1997). Results of the survey show that at least 138 herds may have been affected with acute PRRS. Veterinary Services, the National Pork Producers Council, the American Association of Swine Practitioners, and other members of the swine industry are now implementing an investigative study of acute PRRS epidemiology. This is the first collaborative effort by these groups in response to an emerging animal health issue and may be the new model of cooperative studies for the future. Planning began in January 1997. Data collection began in May. The goals of the study are (1) better characterization of the role of the agent involved and (2) identification of management factors that put producers at risk for acute PRRS. This report describes the study and provides an update on data collected to date.  56   There are three current theories on the causes of acute PRRS, including (1) a change in management or herd immunity that alters the clinical expression of conventional PRRS virus, (2) a change in the conventional PRRS virus, or (3) emergence of a previously unidentified risk factor. To address these hypotheses, this study will have three parts: (1) a prospective casecontrol study, (2) a retrospective case-control study, and (3) multiple add-on or followup studies. The prospective part will investigate current outbreaks (starting May 1997) of acute PRRS using case herds selected from submissions to designated State veterinary diagnostic laboratories. The retrospective study will collect data from case herds that have previously reported outbreaks through the American Association of Swine Practitioners' survey. Followup projects will be implemented by various universities. The followup studies will assess the longer range production impacts, provide a better characterization of the virus, or perform other detailed investigations. Producer and practitioner participation in these studies is voluntary and completely confidential. The case-control study design offers significant benefits for studying a disease such as acute PRRS. The approach works well for a disease whose occurrence is relatively rare. Sample size requirements are relatively low, and the design can be used to go back and retrospectively study outbreaks that have already occurred (Cole 1979). Prospective Phase--For the prospective part, producers from any State can submit samples for consideration through their veterinarian. However, samples must be submitted to the seven participating veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDL's). The laboratories are located in Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana, and Illinois. These States' laboratories were selected because the States account for most of the U.S. hog population (table 1). In addition, these States were concerned about acute PRRS and were willing to cooperate in finding cases of the disease. The herd selection methods will be different for case and control premises but should represent the same population of potentially affected producers. Case herds will be identified when an operation with high abortion or preweaning mortality submits samples through its veterinarian to one of the seven participating VDL's. The receiving diagnostician will proceed with the laboratories' normal abortion workup. If the diagnostician suspects that a herd qualifies for the study, the diagnostician will notify the designated VDL contact. The VDL contact will conduct a screening survey over the phone by talking with the submitting veterinary practitioner. The survey will be completed on an APHIS site on the World Wide Web. Each laboratory has been issued a unique access code to prevent unauthorized data entry. No data will be accessible via the World Wide Web. Using Internet technology will allow immediate feedback to the diagnostician and veterinarian as to whether the herd in question qualifies as a case. If the herd qualifies, the project coordinators in Fort Collins, CO, are immediately notified by e-mail to begin additional data collection.  57   Table 1--Hog populations and number of operations in States with diagnostic laboratories participating in the acute PRRS investigative study1  State  Breeding inventory  Total sows  Number of operations With < With > Total 100 sows 100 sows  Total operations  Thousand hogs Iowa North Carolina Minnesota Illinois Indiana South Dakota Nebraska Total U.S. total Percent 1  Percent 28.6 21.0  Thousand 4.6 16.4  Percent 38.8  1,250  1,000 540 520 460  22.9 12.3 11.9 10.5  6.0 11.0 8.8 8.5  4.0 5.0 2.9 4.2  2.0 6.0 5.9 4.3  4.7 14.2 13.9 10.2  155 45 4,375 6,663 --  3.5 10.3 100 -- 65.7  3.5 8.0 66.8 157.45 --  1.2 2.6 24.5 96 --  2.3 5.4 42.3 61.5 --  5.4 12.8 100 -- 68.8  Based on the Hogs and Pigs Report, Dec. 27, 1996, published by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.  58   Case herds are currently defined as those with abortion rates greater than 3 percent if less than 7 days into the outbreak, 8 percent if 7 to 10 days, or greater than 12 percent if the outbreak lasts more than 10 days. A case herd may also have preweaning mortality greater than 25 percent within last 28 days. Also, if the diagnostician considers this herd to have acute PRRS, an investigation will be performed. To qualify for the prospective phase, case herds must still be experiencing these production problems. Control herds will need to meet the same criteria as a case herd without reporting an abortion episode with rates greater than 5 percent for any 1 month within the last 15 months or preweaning mortality greater than 25 percent. Case and control herds must also have computerized production records they are willing to share and have more than 50 sows on March 1, 1997. Control herd selection will begin after case identification. The APHIS, VS, veterinary medical officer (VMO) assigned to the district involving a case herd will be notified. The VMO will visit the veterinarian. He or she will generate a list of all swine clients in the practice. From this list, the VMO will randomly select client names using a random numbers table. The VMO will conduct a quick screening survey and select another name if the herd chosen does not qualify. The practitioner will contact the producer asking permission to arrange a farm visit. The farm visit will involve a management survey, conducted by the VMO, and blood and tissue collection by the practitioner. Data collection will be the same on case and control farms. Additionally, on case farms, fresh tissues (lung, spleen, and kidney) and thoracic fluid or serum will be collected from recently aborted piglets. Serum samples will be collected from 30 randomly selected sows or gilts and 15 neonatal (< 24 hours old) piglets (maximum of 3 piglets/litter). Sows will be rebled 3 to 4 weeks later to evaluate changes in serum antibody levels. All samples will be sent to NVSL. Serum samples will be tested for the presence of PRRS virus and stored for later use, as needed. Neonatal piglet serum and fetal tissue samples will undergo virus isolation procedures to isolate PRRS or any other potential viral agent. Data on farrowing and weaned pig production will be collected for the baseline time period of January through February 1997 and the time period of the outbreak. This production data was used to reclassify herds as cases or controls for analysis. Data entry and analysis will be conducted at the Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH) in Fort Collins, CO. Retrospective Phase--For the retrospective part of the study, members of the American Association of Swine Practitioners responding to the Association's survey will be telephoned. They will be asked to provide names of producers they believe have experienced acute PRRS in 1996 or 1997. Practitioners reporting they had not seen acute PRRS will be asked to provide names of two producers to serve as controls. All producers will be given a short telephone interview. The questions asked will be similar to those asked in the on farm management survey of the prospective phase. Analysis will be conducted at CEAH in the same manner as the prospective phase of the study.  59   To aid in the prevention and control of acute PRRS, results will be disseminated to producers and practitioners through as many venues as possible.

In Humans--S. typhimurium DT104 was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1984 and has been reported in the United States, Canada, and many other European countries. This organism is now the second most prevalent strain of Salmonella isolated from humans in England and Wales (Threlfall et al. 1992, DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). The number of reported isolates of DT104 in England and Wales has increased from 259 in 1990 to 3,837 in 1995 (Thelfall et al. 1992). Of particular importance in this increase has been the epidemic spread of DT104 with a multiple antimicrobial resistance pattern (R-type) to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (ACSSuT). In England and Wales, the proportion of DT104 that was R-type ACSSuT increased from 27 percent in 1990 to 79 percent in 1993 and decreased to 54 percent in 1995 (Threlfall et al. 1992). Molecular studies have demonstrated that in this strain, resistance genes are chromosomally encoded. This is of concern because removal of the selective pressure, as in plasmid-mediated resistance, is expected to have no effect on reversion to susceptibility. Of additional concern is the increasing additional resistance of DT104 to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone). In the United States, the proportion of S. typhimurium isolates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-selected county studies that were R-type ACSSuT increased from 2 percent in 1980 to 4 percent in 1985, to 9 percent in 1990, and to 12 percent in 1995 (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). Studies are under way to determine how many of these isolates are DT104. National CDC studies in 1995 (all 50 States) and 1996 (14 State and local health departments) found that 28 and 33 percent, respectively, of S. typhimurium isolates were R-type ACSSuT (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). In both studies, approximately 85 percent of isolates phagetyped were DT104. To date, no additional resistance to trimethoprim or fluoroquinolones has been reported among DT104 isolates in the United States.  60   The clinical features associated with infection with DT104 R-type ACSSuT suggest that these infections may be more severe than other nontyphoid Salmonella infections. These outcomes include increased hospitalization and mortality rates. Epidemiologic studies in the United Kingdom suggest DT104 infections are associated with foodborne exposure, including processed and unprocessed foods of animal origin, or domestic and farm animal contact (particularly animals with diarrhea such as cattle and cats) (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). In Animals--S. typhimurium DT104 has been isolated from a wide range of wild, companion, and food animals (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). In the United Kingdom, from 1993 to 1995, the prevalence of reported DT104 R-type ACSSuT isolations increased in cattle, poultry, and sheep to become the most common Salmonella serotype and phage type (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). The proportions of Salmonella DT104 isolates from cattle received at the national veterinary diagnostic laboratory were 44 percent in adult cattle and 45 percent in calves during 1993; this increased to 56 percent and 68 percent, respectively, in 1995 (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). Of the 110 Salmonella isolates from cats in the United Kingdom received by the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens during 199195, 78 (71 percent) were serotype typhimurium, and 40 (51 percent) of those were DT104 R-type ACSSuT (Wall et al. 1996). In the United States, retrospective examination by the diagnostic laboratory at Washington State University of S. typhimurium isolates obtained from cattle in the Pacific Northwest showed none submitted in 198386 were R-type ACSSuT compared with 12 percent of isolates obtained between 1987 and 1990, and over 60 percent in 199196. Selected isolates have been phagetyped as DT104 (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). Although differences in sample source, species, and animal clinical status limit interpretation and comparison of prevalence data, the proportion of S. typhimurium isolates from national USDA 1995 and 1996 studies that were R-type ACSSuT increased from 10 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 1996 (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). Studies are under way to determine how many of these isolates are DT104. Of 549 S. typhimurium isolates submitted to USDA from October 1996 to midFebruary 1997 from various species nationwide, 143 (26 percent) were R-type ACSSuT and 90 (16 percent) of these were DT104 (DT104 Workshop Minutes 1997). The clinical features associated with infection with DT104 R-type ACSSuT suggest that these infections may be more severe (higher morbidity and mortality rates) than other nontyphoid Salmonella infections. Animals may also serve as asymptomatic carriers of DT104. Long-term carriage has been observed in multiple species, particularly in cats and cattle. A single case-control study of risk factors for DT104, R-type ACSSuT infection in cattle in Great Britain identified the following factors with an increased risk of infection: introduction of new additions to a herd; purchase of cattle from dealers, close confinement, inadequate or nonexistent isolation facilities for sick cattle, a high population density of feral cats, and access of birds to feed storage facilities (Evans  61   and Davis 1996). Possible modes of cat acquisition of this infection are through eating contaminated human food or by preying on rodents infected with DT104. Cats may then serve as a source of the organism for humans through contact or for cattle though feed contamination. Prevention and Control of DT104 Infections--To address this emerging public and veterinary health problem, representatives from the United States (CDC, USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and various academic institutions), Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands attended a workshop held in Atlanta, GA, in May 1997. The workshop's goals were to review the available data on DT104, and to identify research (laboratory and epidemiology) needs, available resources, and potential areas for collaboration. The workshop recommended the appointment of an interagency project team of public and animal health agency representatives to coordinate activities involving DT104. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is leading a working group in assessing the situation with DT104 in the United States and developing objectives to be addressed by the interagency team.

The course, jointly sponsored by Emory University, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and CDC, was entitled, ""Emerging Infections: Clinical and Pathologic Update"" and presented numerous topics of current interest from both clinical and pathological perspectives. Topics covered were diverse and included plague, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, microsporidiosis, Hantavirus, viral hepatitis, Ebola virus, streptococcal disease, bartonellosis, cryptosporidiosis, amebiasis, and Helicobacter pylori. A comparative medicine theme was a resounding refrain, with physicians and veterinarians as participating speakers. Presentations on the following topics included information on approaches to the pathologic diagnosis of infectious diseases with emphasis on morphology and molecular biology:              Human ehrlichiosis in the United States Pathology of Ehrlichia and other rickettsial infections Lyme disease Pathology of human Borrelia infection Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever Ebola virus infection in nonhuman primate models Zoonoses and emerging pathogens: the role of veterinary medicine Emerging fungal infections: cryptococcosis, fusariotoxicosis, and Penicilliosis marneffei Laboratory diagnosis of cryptococcosis, fusariotoxicosis, and P. marneffei Pathology of infection with cryptococcosis, fusariotoxicosis, and P. marneffei Epidemiologic and clinical features of cryptosporidiosis: What have we learned since Milwaukee?

The second annual FAD seminar via satellite was held on April 17, 1997. In cooperation with Organizational and Professional Development, Emergency Programs, APHIS, USDA, and Home Team Sports of Bethesda, MD, the seminar was an excellent continuing education program. The program was beamed to about 1,000 people at 68 downlink sites (3 outside the United States) and included USDA regional participation, 12 colleges of veterinary medicine, 5 veterinary science departments, and industry colleagues. The program included 6 hours of instruction. The objectives of the seminar were (1) to incorporate revised procedures for investigating a suspected FAD into day-to-day work; (2) to describe the current world situation on FMD, HC and BSE; (3) to discuss on-the-farm investigations in the United Kingdom and the impact of BSE on the British and American farmer; and (4) to visualize the impact of emerging diseases on the state of American agriculture. Several program topics were presented by a wide range of experts. The afternoon session was followed by a panel discussion.  A 2-week FAD training course for Federal veterinarians was held from April 28 to May 9, 1997. The first week of the course was conducted at the NVSL, Ames, IA, and the second week was held at Plum Island, NY. Twenty-four Federal veterinarians, six from each region, were participants in the course. Two trained, experienced FAD diagnosticians, Drs. T. Schiefer and T. Vardy, assisted with the course. Speakers were drawn from various sources to include universities and Federal veterinarians. The course objectives were to be able (1) to conduct and report a suspected FAD investigation properly; (2) to recognize clinical signs and lesions, identify the species affected, and draw upon knowledge of the causative agent of the foreign animal diseases discussed; (3) to provide a differential diagnosis to include relevant domestic diseases; (4) to collect a probang specimen and take a tonsillary biopsy from a pig properly; (5) to conduct a systematic postmortem of the avian, porcine, and bovine species; (6) to collect correct diagnostic specimens, properly preserve and package the specimens, and prepare them for shipment to the laboratory; (7) to prepare essential paperwork properly; and (8) to recognize the importance of vectors in FAD's. The course was very well received, and we would like to thank all the speakers and support staff at NVSL and Plum Island for their support, especially the animal caretakers. Special thanks are extended to Drs. Schiefer and Vardy.  64    Wildlife seminar on FAD preparedness, June 1997, College of Veterinary Medicine and Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Unit, University of Georgia, Athens.

Russell, MD Kevin Tonat, DrPH, MPH for the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality. R. R. Parker1 Objective The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense has developed consensusbased recommendations for measures to be taken by medical and public health professionals if tularemia is used as a biological weapon against a civilian population. Participants The working group included 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions and agencies. Evidence MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2000, using the Medical Subject Headings Francisella tularensis, Pasteurella tularensis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. Consensus Process Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. Conclusions A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period. JAMA. 2001;285:2763-2773 www.jama.com  T  ULAREMIA, A BACTERIAL ZOONOsis, is the subject of this fifth article in a series providing recommendations for medical and public health management following use of various agents as biological weapons of terrorism.2-5 The causative agent of tularemia, Francisella tularensis, is one of the most infectious pathogenic bacteria known, requiring inoculation or inhalation of as few as 10 organisms to cause disease.6,7 Humans become incidentally  infected through diverse environmental exposures and can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit infection to others. The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense considers F tularensis to be a dangerous potential biological weapon because of its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination, and substantial capacity to cause illness and death.8-11 Author Affiliations: National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga (Drs Dennis, Lillibridge, and McDade); Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine (Drs Inglesby, Bartlett, and Perl) and Public Health (Drs Henderson, O'Toole, and Russell), Baltimore, Md; Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Health Services, Berkeley (Dr Ascher); US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, Md (Drs Eitzen, Friedlander, and Parker); Bureau of Communicable Disease, New York City Health Department  CONSENSUS METHODS The working group comprised 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions.

Review of the bibliographies of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other published and unpublished references and sources for review. The first draft of the consensus statement was a synthesis of information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process. Members of the working group were asked to make written comments on this first draft in May 1999. Subsequent revised drafts were reviewed and edited until full consensus of the working group was achieved. HISTORY AND POTENTIAL AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON Tularemia was first described as a plaguelike disease of rodents in 1911 and, shortly thereafter, was recognized as a potentially severe and fatal illness in humans.12 Tularemia's epidemic potential became apparent in the 1930s and 1940s, when large waterborne outbreaks occurred in Europe and the Soviet Union13-15 and epizootic-associated cases occurred in the United States.16,17 As well, F tularensis quickly gained notoriety as a virulent laboratory hazard.18,19 Public health concerns impelled substantial early investigations into tularemia's ecology, microbiology, pathogenicity, and prevention.19-22 Francisella tularensis has long been considered a potential biological weapon. It was one of a number of agents studied at Japanese germ warfare research units operating in Manchuria between 1932 and 194523; it was also examined for military purposes in the West. A former Soviet Union biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibeck, has suggested that tularemia outbreaks affecting tens of thousands of Soviet and German soldiers on the eastern European front during World War II may have been the result of intentional use.24 Following the war, there were continuing military studies of tularemia. In the  1950s and 1960s, the US military developed weapons that would disseminate F tularensis aerosols10; concurrently, it conducted research to better understand the pathophysiology of tularemia and to develop vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment regimens. In some studies, volunteers were infected with F tularensis by direct aerosol delivery systems and by exposures in an aerosol chamber.10 A live attenuated vaccine was developed that partially protected against respiratory and intracutaneous challenges with the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis,6,7 and various regimens of streptomycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol were found to be effective in prophylaxis and treatment.25-27 By the late 1960s, F tularensis was one of several biological weapons stockpiled by the US military.10 According to Alibeck, a large parallel effort by the Soviet Union continued into the early 1990s and resulted in weapons production of F tularensis strains engineered to be resistant to antibiotics and vaccines.24 In 1969, a World Health Organization expert committee estimated that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of virulent F tularensis over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250 000 incapacitating casualties, including 19 000 deaths.28 Illness would be expected to persist for several weeks and disease relapses to occur during the ensuing weeks or months. It was assumed that vaccinated individuals would be only partially protected against an aerosol exposure. Referring to this model, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently examined the expected economic impact of bioterrorist attacks and estimated the total base costs to society of an F tularensis aerosol attack to be $5.4 billion for every 100 000 persons exposed.9 The United States terminated its biological weapons development program by executive order in 1970 and, by 1973, had destroyed its entire biological arsenal.10 Since then, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has been responsible for defensive medical research on F tu-  larensis and other potential biological warfare agents to better protect the US military, including protocols on decontamination, prophylaxis, clinical recognition, laboratory diagnosis, and medical management.29 The CDC operates a national program for bioterrorism preparedness and response that incorporates a broad range of public health partnerships.30,31 EPIDEMIOLOGY Geographic Distribution and Human Exposures  Tularemia occurs throughout much of North America and Eurasia.15,21,22,32 In the United States, human cases have been reported from every state except Hawaii; however, most cases occur in south-central and western states (especially Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).33-35 In Eurasia, the disease is also widely endemic, although the greatest numbers of human cases are reported from northern and central Europe, especially Scandinavian countries and those of the former Soviet Union.36,37 Tularemia is almost entirely a rural disease, although urban and suburban exposures occasionally do occur.38-41 Throughout its range, F tularensis is found in widely diverse animal hosts and habitats and can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation.15,20-22,32 A variety of small mammals, including voles, mice, water rats, squirrels, rabbits, and hares, are natural reservoirs of infection. They acquire infection through bites by ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, and by contact with contaminated environments. Although enzootic cycles of F tularensis typically occur without notice, epizootics with sometimes extensive dieoffs of animal hosts may herald outbreaks of tularemia in humans.16,22,42,43 Humans become infected with F tularensis by various modes, including bites by infective arthropods,42,44-47 handling infectious animal tissues or fluids,17,48,49 direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil,13,20,40,50,51 and inhalation of infective aerosols.43,52-56 Persons of all ages  2764 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Certain activities, such as hunting, trapping, butchering, and farming, are most likely to expose adult men. Laboratory workers are especially vulnerable to infection, either by accidentally inoculating themselves or by inhaling aerosolized organisms.18,22,56-58 Ordinary exposures during examination of an open culture plate can cause infection. Although F tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, its transmission from person to person has not been documented. Incidence  The worldwide incidence of tularemia is not known, and the disease is probably greatly underrecognized and underreported. In the United States, reported cases have dropped sharply from several thousand per year prior to 1950 to less than 200 per year in the 1990s.33-35 Between 1985 and 1992, 1409 cases and 20 deaths were reported in the United States, for a mean of 171 cases per year and a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.34 Persons in all age groups were affected, but most were children younger than 10 years and adults aged 50 years or older. Of 1298 cases for which information on sex was available, 942 (72.6%) occurred in males, and males outnumbered females in all age groups. Most cases occur in June through September, when arthropod-borne transmission is most common.17,35,59 Cases in winter usually occur among hunters and trappers who handle infected animal carcasses.17,35,48 In the United States, cases are mostly sporadic or occur in small clusters34,35,49; in Eurasia, waterborne, arthropod-borne, and airborne outbreaks involving hundreds of persons have been reported.40,43,44,51,53-55 Natural Occurrences of Inhalational Tularemia  The largest recorded airborne tularemia outbreak occurred in 1966-1967 in an extensive farming area of Sweden.43 This outbreak involved more than 600 patients infected with strains of the milder European biovar of F tularensis  (F tularensis biovar palaearctica) [type B]), most of whom acquired infection while doing farm work that created contaminated aerosols. Case exposures and disease onsets occurred during a period of months but peaked during the winter, when rodent-infested hay was being sorted and moved from field storage sites to barns. Among 140 serologically confirmed cases thought to have been infected by inhalation, most had typical acute symptoms of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, and malaise; only 14 (10%) of confirmed patients had symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and chest pains. Patients generally responded well to tetracycline, and no deaths were reported. Inhalational tularemia in the United States has involved only single cases or small clusters of cases, variously resulting from laboratory exposures,18,56,57 disturbance of contaminated animal carcasses,38,39,41 and suspected infective environmental aerosols.41,52 Cases of inhalational tularemia in the United States are thought to be due mostly to the more virulent F tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) and usually follow an acute and severe course, with prominent pneumonitis. Some cases, however, have radiographic evidence of pleuropneumonia with minimal or absent respiratory signs on physical examination.39,41,52 Although airborne F tularensis would be expected to principally cause primary pleuropneumonic infection, some exposures might contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. In the aforementioned Swedish outbreak, conjunctivitis was reported in 26% of 140 confirmed cases and an infected ulcer of the skin was reported in nearly 12%; pharyngitis was reported in 31% and oral ulcers in about 9% of the cases; and 32% of these patients had various exanthemas, such as erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.43 Tularemia outbreaks arising from similar agricultural exposures have been reported from Finland,53 mostly presenting with general constitutional  symptoms rather than specific manifestations of pneumonia; enlargement of hilar nodes was the principal radiographic finding in these cases.54 Inhalational Tularemia Following Use as a Biological Weapon  Although F tularensis could be used as a weapon in a number of ways, the working group believes that an aerosol release would have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Release in a densely populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of cases of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning 3 to 5 days later (incubation range, 1-14 days), with pleuropneumonitis developing in a significant proportion of cases during the ensuing days and weeks. Public health authorities would most likely become aware of an outbreak of unusual respiratory disease in its early stages, but this could be difficult to distinguish from a natural outbreak of community-acquired infection, especially influenza or various atypical pneumonias. The abrupt onset of large numbers of acutely ill persons, the rapid progression in a relatively high proportion of cases from upper respiratory symptoms and bronchitis to lifethreatening pleuropneumonitis and systemic infection affecting, among others, young, previously healthy adults and children should, however, quickly alert medical professionals and public health authorities to a critical and unexpected public health event and to bioterrorism as a possible cause (TABLE 1). Until the etiology became clear, clinicians would need to work closely with epidemiologists and diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the illness from various community-acquired pneumonias and to determine if it could have resulted from use of one of several potential bioterrorism weapons agents, such as those causing tularemia, plague, anthrax, or Q fever.2,4,29 In general, tularemia would be expected to have a slower progression of illness and a lower case-fatality rate than either inhalational plague or anthrax. Plague would most likely progress very 2765  2001 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Diagnosis of Inhalational Tularemia Following Use of a Biological Weapon Clinical Findings Sudden onset of acute febrile illness, progressing in some patients to pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, hilar lymphadenitis. Complications of overwhelming untreated infection may lead to sepsis and inflammatory response syndrome. Epidemiology Point-source outbreak pattern; likely urban, nonagricultural setting. Unexpected severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy persons. Risk related to degree of exposure with no differences in susceptibility by age or sex. Microbiology Small, gram-negative coccobacilli in direct stain of respiratory secretions. Sputum, tracheobronchial secretions, and blood should be cultured using cysteine-enriched medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates should be determined. Direct fluorescent antibody stain is first-line, rapid identification procedure at reference laboratories. Polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection procedures may also provide rapid identification. Microagglutination assay can detect serum antibodies beginning 10 days after illness onset. Virulence testing and molecular genetic characterizations are performed at specialized laboratories. Pathology Histological findings of acute suppurative necrosis followed by granulomatous reactions. Target organs include lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney. Radiology Peribronchial infiltrates leading to bronchopneumonia in 1 or more lobes, often accompanied by pleural effusion and enlarged hilar nodes. Signs may be absent or minimal, with only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates, or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura.  rapidly to severe pneumonia, with copious watery or purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and shock.4 Inhalational anthrax would be differentiated by its characteristic radiological findings of prominent symmetric mediastinal widening and absence of bronchopneumonia.2 As well, anthrax patients would be expected to develop fulminating, toxic, and fatal illness despite antibiotic treatment.29 Milder forms of inhalational tularemia could be clinically indistinguishable from Q fever; establishing a diagnosis of either would be problematic without reference laboratory testing. Presumptive laboratory diagnoses of plague or anthrax would be expected to be made relatively quickly, although microbiological confirmation could take days. Isolation and identification of F tularensis using routine laboratory procedures could take several weeks. Once a substantial cluster of cases of inhalational tularemia had been identified, epidemiological findings should suggest a bioterrorist event. The abrupt onset and single peak of cases would implicate a point-source exposure without secondary transmission. Among exposed persons, attack rates would likely  be similar across sex and age groups, and risk would be related to degree of exposure to the point source (Table 1). An outbreak of inhalational tularemia in an urban setting should trigger a high level of suspicion of an intentional event, since all reported inhalational tularemia outbreaks have occurred in rural areas. MICROBIOLOGY AND VIRULENCE FACTORS Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus. It has a thin lipopolysaccharide-containing envelope and is a hardy nonspore-forming organism that survives for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying animal carcasses.21,22,60,61 Francisella tularensis has been divided into 2 major subspecies (biovars) by virulence testing, biochemical reactions, and epidemiological features.62 Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) may be highly virulent in humans and animals, produces acid from glycerol, demonstrates citrulline ureidase activity, and is the most common biovar isolated in North America.22,60 Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is relatively avirulent, does not produce acid  from glycerol, and does not demonstrate citrulline ureidase activity. In Europe and Asia, all human tularemia is thought to be caused by the milder type B strains, although recent studies there have identified naturally occurring F tularensis related to F tularensis biovar tularensis. 63,64 A few rapidly growing strains of F tularensis have been recovered from the blood of immunocompromised patients not showing seroreactivity to F tularensis.65 Transformed plasmids have been engineered to express chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance in F tularensis.66 Virulent, streptomycin-resistant F tularensis strains have been examined in biowarfare agent studies both in the United States and the Soviet Union.24,27,56 Although F tularensis virulence factors are poorly understood and characterized,67,68 it is possible that strain virulence could be enhanced through laboratory manipulation. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pathogenesis  Francisella tularensis can infect humans through the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages.68,69 The major target organs are the lymph nodes, lungs and pleura, spleen, liver, and kidney.19,20,49,70-72 Untreated, bacilli inoculated into skin or mucous membranes multiply, spread to the regional lymph nodes and further multiply, and may then disseminate to organs throughout the body. Bacteremia may be common in the early phase of infection. The initial tissue reaction to infection is a focal, intensely suppurative necrosis consisting largely of accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by invasion of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. Suppurative lesions become granulomatous, and histopathological examination of the granulomas shows a central necrotic, sometimes caseating zone surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and fibroblasts in a radial arrange-  2766 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Bronchopneumonia was most pronounced in animals exposed to the smaller particles and was characterized by tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement and reddish, firm, 0.2- to 0.5cm-diameter discrete inflammatory lesions scattered throughout the lungs. In the absence of treatment, the disease progressed to pneumonic consolidation and organization, granuloma formation, and eventual chronic interstitial fibrosis. Humans with inhalational exposures also develop hemorrhagic inflammation of the airways early in the course of illness, which may progress to bronchopneumonia.54 Histopathological examination of affected lungs shows alveolar spaces filled with an exudate of mononuclear cells. Pleuritis with adhesions and effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are common radiological and pathological findings.70,72 Clinical Manifestations  The primary clinical forms of tularemia vary in severity and presentation according to virulence of the infecting organism, dose, and site of inoculum. Primary disease presentations include ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic forms.19,20,49,70,72,74,75 The term typhoidal tularemia has been used to describe illness in tularemia patients with systemic infections manifesting as fever and other constitutional signs without cutaneous or mucosal membrane lesions or regional lymphadenitis. Sometimes, these patients present with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea and pain. Confusion is created when typhoidal tularemia is used to describe the illness in patients infected by  inhalation, especially when there are signs of pleuropneumonic disease; this usage can be misleading and has been discouraged.54,75 The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever (38C-40C), headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. A pulsetemperature dissociation has been noted in as many as 42% of patients.49 A dry or slightly productive cough and substernal pain or tightness frequently occur with or without objective signs of pneumonia, such as purulent sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis.7,19,26,70,74 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea sometimes occur. Sweats, fever and chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. Studies of volunteers have shown that F tularensis aerosol exposures can incapacitate some persons in the first 1 or 2 days of illness, and significant impairment in performing tasks can continue for days after antibiotic treatment is begun.76 In untreated tularemia, symptoms often persist for several weeks and, sometimes, for months, usually with progressive debility. Any form of tularemia may be complicated by hematogenous spread, resulting in secondary pleuropneumonia, sepsis, and, rarely, meningitis.74,77 Prior to the advent of antibiotics, the overall mortality from infections with the more severe type A strains was in the range of 5% to 15%, and fatality rates as high as 30% to 60% were reported for untreated pneumonic and severe systemic forms of disease.72,78 Currently, the overall case-fatality rate of reported cases in the United States is less than 2%.34,49 Type B infections are rarely fatal. In ulceroglandular tularemia, the form that typically arises from handling a contaminated carcass or following an infective arthropod bite, a local cutaneous papule appears at the inoculation site at about the time of onset of generalized symptoms, becomes pustular, and ulcerates within a few days of its first appearance. The ulcer is ten-  Figure 1. Cervical Lymphadenitis in a Patient With Pharyngeal Tularemia  Patient has marked swelling and fluctuant suppuration of several anterior cervical nodes.

Typically, one or more regional afferent lymph nodes may become enlarged and tender within several days of the appearance of the papule. Even with antibiotic treatment, the affected nodes may become fluctuant and rupture. In oculoglandular tularemia, which follows direct contamination of the eye, ulceration occurs on the conjunctiva, accompanied by pronounced chemosis, vasculitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Glandular tularemia is characterized by lymphadenopathy without an ulcer. Oropharyngeal tularemia is acquired by drinking contaminated water, ingesting contaminated food, and, sometimes, by inhaling contaminated droplets or aerosols.14,20,36,43,50,51,79 Affected persons may develop stomatitis but more commonly develop exudative pharyngitis or tonsillitis, sometimes with ulceration. Pronounced cervical or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy may occur (FIGURE 1).74,79 Tularemia pneumonia can be the direct result of inhaling contaminated aerosols or be secondary to hematogenous spread from a distal site. An aerosol release of F tularensis would be expected to result in acute illness with signs and symptoms of 1 or more of pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pleuropneumonitis, and hilar lymphadenitis, accompanied by various manifesta2767  2001 American Medical Association.

Although volunteers challenged with aerosols of virulent F tularensis (type A) regularly developed systemic symptoms of acute illness 3 to 5 days following exposure, only 25% to 50% of participants had radiological evidence of pneumonia in the early stages of infection.7,26 On the other hand, pulmonary infection can sometimes rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.72,80 Lung abscesses occur infrequently.75 Typhoidal tularemia is used to describe systemic illness in the absence of signs indicating either site of inoculation or anatomic localization of infection. This should be differentiated from inhalational tularemia with pleuropneumonic disease.54,75 Tularemia sepsis is potentially severe and fatal. As in typhoidal tularemia, nonspecific findings of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be prominent early in the course of illness. The patient typically appears toxic and may develop confusion and coma. Unless treated promptly, septic shock and other complications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome may ensue, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and organ failure.80 DIAGNOSIS Tularemia in humans occurs infrequently, resulting in a low index of diagnostic suspicion among clinicians and laboratorians. Since rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available, the first indication of intentional tularemia might follow recognition by public health authorities of a clustering of acute, severe respiratory illness with unusual epidemiological features (Table 1). Suspicion of tularemia might be triggered in alert clini-  tions of systemic illness. Inhalational exposures, however, commonly result in an initial clinical picture of systemic illness without prominent signs of respiratory disease.7,43,53,56 The earliest pulmonary radiographic findings of inhalational tularemia may be peribronchial infiltrates, typically advancing to bronchopneumonia in 1 o r  cians encountering patients with findings of atypical pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Identification of F tularensis in clinical specimens may be missed or delayed for days or weeks when procedures for routine microbiological screening of bacterial pathogens are followed, and it is unlikely that a serendipitous laboratory identification would be the sentinel event that alerted authorities to a major bioterrorism action. Physicians who suspect inhalational tularemia should promptly collect specimens of respiratory secretions and blood and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Francisella tularensis may be identified by direct examination of secretions, exudates, or biopsy specimens using direct fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical stains.81-83 By light microscopy, the organism is characterized by its small size (0.2 m 0.2-0.7 m), pleomorphism, and faint staining. It does not show the bipolar staining characteristics of Yersinia pestis,4 the agent of plague, and is easily distinguished from the large gram-positive rods characteristic of vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis (FIGURE 3).2 Microscopic demonstration of F tularensis using fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public Health Laboratory Network; test results can be made available within several hours of receiving the appropriate specimens if the laboratory is alerted and prepared. Suspicion of inhalational tularemia must be promptly reported to local or state public health authorities so timely epidemiological and environmental investigations can be made (BOX). Growth of F tularensis in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia.60,81 Francisella tularensis can be grown from pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, and even fasting gastric aspirates in a high proportion of patients with inhalational tularemia.56 It is only occasionally isolated from the blood.

Selective agar (such as chocolate agar selective for Neisseria gonorrhea isolation) may be useful when culturing materials from nonsterile sites, such as sputum. Inoculated media should be incubated at 37C. Although growth may be visible as early as 24 to 48 hours after inoculation, growth may be delayed and cultures should be held for at least 10 days before discarding. Under ideal conditions, bacterial colonies on cysteineenriched agar are typically 1 mm in diameter after 24 to 48 hours of incubation and 3 to 5 mm in diameter by 96 hours.60,81 On cysteine heart agar, F tularensis colonies are characteristically opalescent and do not discolor the medium (FIGURE 4). Antigen detection assays, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassays, immunoblotting, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis, and other specialized techniques may be used to identify F tularensis and to characterize strains.84-87 These procedures are usually performed only in research and reference laboratories, however. In laboratories where advanced methods are  established, results of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction analyses can be obtained within several hours of receipt of isolates. Typically, serum antibody titers do not attain diagnostic levels until 10 or more days after onset of illness, and serology would provide minimal useful information for managing an outbreak. Serological confirmation of cases, however, may be of value for forensic or epidemiological purposes. Most laboratories use tube agglutination or microagglutination tests that detect combined immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.84,85 A 4-fold change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, a single titer of at least 1:160 for tube agglutination or 1:128 for microagglutination is diagnostic for F tularensis infection. Information on reference diagnostic testing and shipping/ handling of specimens can be obtained from state public health laboratories and from the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, Colo (telephone: [970] 221-6400; e-mail: dvbid@cdc.gov). VACCINATION Beginning in the 1930s, t he Soviet Union used a live attenuated vaccine to immunize tens of millions of persons living in tularemia-endemic areas.88 In  Figure 4.

In a retrospective study of civilians working with F tularensis at a US Army research facility, the incidence of accidental acute inhalational tularemia among laboratorians declined from 5.70 cases per 1000 person-years of risk at 2769  2001 American Medical Association.

In volunteer studies, the live attenuated vaccine did not protect all recipients against aerosol challenges with virulent F tularensis.7,26 Correlates of protective immunity appear about 2 weeks following natural infection or vaccination. Given the short incubation period of tularemia and incomplete protection of current vaccines against inhalational tularemia, vaccination is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis.

Ciprofloxacin, which is not labeled for use in tularemia, has been shown to be active against F tularensis in vitro94 and in animals95 and has been used to successfully treat tularemia in both adults and chil-  dren.90,94,96,97 Treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days. In persons beginning treatment with parenteral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, therapy can be switched to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated. Very limited experiences in treating tularemia patients with -lactam and macrolide antibiotics have been reported, and treatment failures have occurred.98 Use of -lactam and macrolide antibiotics in treating tularemia is neither FDA-approved nor recommended by the working group. Children. In children, streptomycin or gentamicin is recommended by the working group as first-line treatment in a contained casualty situation (Table 2). Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin ( 1 g/d), and chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives to aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause cartilage damage in immature animals and are not FDA-approved for use in children. However, short courses of these agents have not been associated with arthropathy in pediatric patients, and the potential risks of their use must be weighed against their benefits in treating serious infections.96,99,100 Mass Casualty Situation  Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, administered orally, are the preferred choices for treatment in the mass casualty setting, for both adults and children (TABLE 3). The ciprofloxacin dosage for children should not exceed 1 g/d. In a mass casualty situation, the working group believes the benefits to children from short courses of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (Table 3) outweigh the risks of their use. Since it is unknown whether drugresistant organisms might be used in a bioterrorist event, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates should be conducted quickly and treatments altered according to test results and clinical responses. Antibiotics for treating patients infected with tularemia in a bioterrorism scenario are included in a national pharmaceutical stockpile  2770 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

In a contained casualty situation, short courses of gentamicin are likely to pose a low risk to fetuses when used to treat tularemia in pregnant women (Table 2). Rare cases of fetal nerve deafness and renal damage have been reported with other aminoglycosides but have not been reported with gentamicin. The benefits of gentamicin in treating pregnant women with tularemia are expected to outweigh any potential risk to fetuses. In a mass casualty situation, oral ciprofloxacin is considered the best alternative to gentamicin for pregnant women (Table 3). Immunosuppressed Persons. There is scant experience in treating tularemia in immunocompromised patients. However, considering the greater occurrence in immunocompetent patients of tularemia relapses and treatment failures following use of bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents compared with aminoglycosides, streptomycin or gentamicin should be used when possible to treat patients with known immune dysfunction in either contained casualty or mass casualty situations (Table 2). POSTEXPOSURE ANTIBIOTIC RECOMMENDATIONS Persons beginning treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin in the incubation period of tularemia and continuing treatment daily for 14 days might be protected against symptomatic infection. In studies of aerosol challenge with infective doses of the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis, each of 8 volunteers given oral dosages of tetracycline, 1 g/d for 28 days, and each of 8 volunteers given tetracycline, 2 g/d for 14 days, were fully protected when treatment was begun 24 hours following challenge.27 Two of 10 volunteers given tetracycline, 1 g/d for only 5 days,  developed symptomatic tularemia after antibiotic treatment was stopped. In the unlikely event that authorities quickly become aware that an F tularensis biological weapon has been used and are able to identify and reach exposed persons during the early incubation period, the working group recommends that exposed persons be prophylactically treated with 14 days of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin (Table 3). In a circumstance in which the weapon attack has been covert and the event is discovered only after persons start to become ill, persons potentially exposed should be instructed to begin a fever watch. Persons who develop an otherwise unexplained fever or flulike illness within 14 days of presumed exposure should begin treatment as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. In the laboratory, persons who have had potentially infective exposures to F tularensis should be administered oral postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis if the risk of infection is high (eg, spill, centrifuge accident, or needlestick). If the risk is low, exposed persons can be placed on a fever watch and treated if they develop symptoms. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment of close contacts of tularemia patients is not recommended since human-to-human transmission of F tularensis is not known to occur. INFECTION CONTROL Isolation is not recommended for tularemia patients, given the lack of human-to-human transmission. In hospitals, standard precautions 101 are recommended by the working group for treatment of patients with tularemia. Microbiology laboratory personnel should be alerted when tularemia is clinically suspected. Routine diagnostic procedures can be performed in biological safety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Examination of cultures in which F tularensis is suspected should be carried out in a biological safety cabinet. Manipulation of cultures and other activities involving infectious materials with a potential for aerosol or droplet production (centrifuging, grinding, vig-  orous shaking, growing cultures in volume, animal studies) require BSL-3 conditions.102 When F tularensis is presumptively identified in a routine BSL-2 clinical laboratory (level A), specimens should be forwarded to a BSL-3 laboratory (level B) (eg, a state public health laboratory) for confirmation of agent and other studies, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.11 Bodies of patients who die of tularemia should be handled using standard precautions. Autopsy procedures likely to cause aerosols, such as bone sawing, should be avoided. Clothing or linens contaminated with body fluids of patients infected with F tularensis should be disinfected per standard precautions protocols.101 ENVIRONMENTAL DECONTAMINATION AND PROTECTION Under natural conditions, F tularensis may survive for extended periods in a cold, moist environment. The working group lacks information on survival of intentionally dispersed particles but would expect a short halflife due to desiccation, solar radiation, oxidation and other environmental factors, and a very limited risk from secondary dispersal. In circumstances of a laboratory spill or intentional use in which authorities are concerned about an environmental risk (eg, inanimate surfaces wet with material thought to contain F tularensis), decontamination can be achieved by spraying the suspected contaminant with a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach and 9 parts water). After 10 minutes, a 70% solution of alcohol can be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action of the bleach. Soap water can be used to flush away less hazardous contaminations. Persons with direct exposure to powder or liquid aerosols containing F tularensis should wash body surfaces and clothing with soap water. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal water sources should protect against waterborne infection.60 Following an urban release, the risk to humans of acquiring tula2771  2001 American Medical Association.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH Simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests that could be used to identify persons infected with F tularensis in the mass exposure setting need to be developed. Further methods should be designed to rapidly define the molecular genetic characteristics of organisms, especially as they may relate to engineered attributes, such as enhanced virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents or normally lethal environmental conditions. Complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of natural strains of F tularensis would provide an archival base for understanding genetic variants, functions of genes, and mechanisms of action useful in developing means to protect against F tularensis. Research is also needed to develop accurate and reliable procedures to rapidly detect F tularensis in environmental samples. New technologies should be explored for developing active (eg, DNAbased) or passive (eg, monoclonal antibodybased) vaccines for rapid preexposure or postexposure protection.

Russell, MD Kevin Tonat, DrPH, MPH for the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality. R. R. Parker1 Objective The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense has developed consensusbased recommendations for measures to be taken by medical and public health professionals if tularemia is used as a biological weapon against a civilian population. Participants The working group included 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions and agencies. Evidence MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2000, using the Medical Subject Headings Francisella tularensis, Pasteurella tularensis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. Consensus Process Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. Conclusions A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period.

The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense considers F tularensis to be a dangerous potential biological weapon because of its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination, and substantial capacity to cause illness and death.8-11 Author Affiliations: National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga (Drs Dennis, Lillibridge, and McDade); Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine (Drs Inglesby, Bartlett, and Perl) and Public Health (Drs Henderson, O'Toole, and Russell), Baltimore, Md; Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Health Services, Berkeley (Dr Ascher); US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, Md (Drs Eitzen, Friedlander, and Parker); Bureau of Communicable Disease, New York City Health Department  CONSENSUS METHODS The working group comprised 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions.

Review of the bibliographies of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other published and unpublished references and sources for review. The first draft of the consensus statement was a synthesis of information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process. Members of the working group were asked to make written comments on this first draft in May 1999. Subsequent revised drafts were reviewed and edited until full consensus of the working group was achieved. HISTORY AND POTENTIAL AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON Tularemia was first described as a plaguelike disease of rodents in 1911 and, shortly thereafter, was recognized as a potentially severe and fatal illness in humans.12 Tularemia's epidemic potential became apparent in the 1930s and 1940s, when large waterborne outbreaks occurred in Europe and the Soviet Union13-15 and epizootic-associated cases occurred in the United States.16,17 As well, F tularensis quickly gained notoriety as a virulent laboratory hazard.18,19 Public health concerns impelled substantial early investigations into tularemia's ecology, microbiology, pathogenicity, and prevention.19-22 Francisella tularensis has long been considered a potential biological weapon. It was one of a number of agents studied at Japanese germ warfare research units operating in Manchuria between 1932 and 194523; it was also examined for military purposes in the West. A former Soviet Union biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibeck, has suggested that tularemia outbreaks affecting tens of thousands of Soviet and German soldiers on the eastern European front during World War II may have been the result of intentional use.24 Following the war, there were continuing military studies of tularemia. In the  1950s and 1960s, the US military developed weapons that would disseminate F tularensis aerosols10; concurrently, it conducted research to better understand the pathophysiology of tularemia and to develop vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment regimens. In some studies, volunteers were infected with F tularensis by direct aerosol delivery systems and by exposures in an aerosol chamber.10 A live attenuated vaccine was developed that partially protected against respiratory and intracutaneous challenges with the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis,6,7 and various regimens of streptomycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol were found to be effective in prophylaxis and treatment.25-27 By the late 1960s, F tularensis was one of several biological weapons stockpiled by the US military.10 According to Alibeck, a large parallel effort by the Soviet Union continued into the early 1990s and resulted in weapons production of F tularensis strains engineered to be resistant to antibiotics and vaccines.24 In 1969, a World Health Organization expert committee estimated that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of virulent F tularensis over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250 000 incapacitating casualties, including 19 000 deaths.28 Illness would be expected to persist for several weeks and disease relapses to occur during the ensuing weeks or months. It was assumed that vaccinated individuals would be only partially protected against an aerosol exposure. Referring to this model, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently examined the expected economic impact of bioterrorist attacks and estimated the total base costs to society of an F tularensis aerosol attack to be $5.4 billion for every 100 000 persons exposed.9 The United States terminated its biological weapons development program by executive order in 1970 and, by 1973, had destroyed its entire biological arsenal.10 Since then, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has been responsible for defensive medical research on F tu-  larensis and other potential biological warfare agents to better protect the US military, including protocols on decontamination, prophylaxis, clinical recognition, laboratory diagnosis, and medical management.29 The CDC operates a national program for bioterrorism preparedness and response that incorporates a broad range of public health partnerships.30,31 EPIDEMIOLOGY Geographic Distribution and Human Exposures  Tularemia occurs throughout much of North America and Eurasia.15,21,22,32 In the United States, human cases have been reported from every state except Hawaii; however, most cases occur in south-central and western states (especially Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).33-35 In Eurasia, the disease is also widely endemic, although the greatest numbers of human cases are reported from northern and central Europe, especially Scandinavian countries and those of the former Soviet Union.36,37 Tularemia is almost entirely a rural disease, although urban and suburban exposures occasionally do occur.38-41 Throughout its range, F tularensis is found in widely diverse animal hosts and habitats and can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation.15,20-22,32 A variety of small mammals, including voles, mice, water rats, squirrels, rabbits, and hares, are natural reservoirs of infection. They acquire infection through bites by ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, and by contact with contaminated environments. Although enzootic cycles of F tularensis typically occur without notice, epizootics with sometimes extensive dieoffs of animal hosts may herald outbreaks of tularemia in humans.16,22,42,43 Humans become infected with F tularensis by various modes, including bites by infective arthropods,42,44-47 handling infectious animal tissues or fluids,17,48,49 direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil,13,20,40,50,51 and inhalation of infective aerosols.43,52-56 Persons of all ages  2764 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Certain activities, such as hunting, trapping, butchering, and farming, are most likely to expose adult men. Laboratory workers are especially vulnerable to infection, either by accidentally inoculating themselves or by inhaling aerosolized organisms.18,22,56-58 Ordinary exposures during examination of an open culture plate can cause infection. Although F tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, its transmission from person to person has not been documented. Incidence  The worldwide incidence of tularemia is not known, and the disease is probably greatly underrecognized and underreported. In the United States, reported cases have dropped sharply from several thousand per year prior to 1950 to less than 200 per year in the 1990s.33-35 Between 1985 and 1992, 1409 cases and 20 deaths were reported in the United States, for a mean of 171 cases per year and a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.34 Persons in all age groups were affected, but most were children younger than 10 years and adults aged 50 years or older. Of 1298 cases for which information on sex was available, 942 (72.6%) occurred in males, and males outnumbered females in all age groups. Most cases occur in June through September, when arthropod-borne transmission is most common.17,35,59 Cases in winter usually occur among hunters and trappers who handle infected animal carcasses.17,35,48 In the United States, cases are mostly sporadic or occur in small clusters34,35,49; in Eurasia, waterborne, arthropod-borne, and airborne outbreaks involving hundreds of persons have been reported.40,43,44,51,53-55 Natural Occurrences of Inhalational Tularemia  The largest recorded airborne tularemia outbreak occurred in 1966-1967 in an extensive farming area of Sweden.43 This outbreak involved more than 600 patients infected with strains of the milder European biovar of F tularensis  (F tularensis biovar palaearctica) [type B]), most of whom acquired infection while doing farm work that created contaminated aerosols. Case exposures and disease onsets occurred during a period of months but peaked during the winter, when rodent-infested hay was being sorted and moved from field storage sites to barns. Among 140 serologically confirmed cases thought to have been infected by inhalation, most had typical acute symptoms of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, and malaise; only 14 (10%) of confirmed patients had symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and chest pains. Patients generally responded well to tetracycline, and no deaths were reported. Inhalational tularemia in the United States has involved only single cases or small clusters of cases, variously resulting from laboratory exposures,18,56,57 disturbance of contaminated animal carcasses,38,39,41 and suspected infective environmental aerosols.41,52 Cases of inhalational tularemia in the United States are thought to be due mostly to the more virulent F tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) and usually follow an acute and severe course, with prominent pneumonitis. Some cases, however, have radiographic evidence of pleuropneumonia with minimal or absent respiratory signs on physical examination.39,41,52 Although airborne F tularensis would be expected to principally cause primary pleuropneumonic infection, some exposures might contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. In the aforementioned Swedish outbreak, conjunctivitis was reported in 26% of 140 confirmed cases and an infected ulcer of the skin was reported in nearly 12%; pharyngitis was reported in 31% and oral ulcers in about 9% of the cases; and 32% of these patients had various exanthemas, such as erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.43 Tularemia outbreaks arising from similar agricultural exposures have been reported from Finland,53 mostly presenting with general constitutional  symptoms rather than specific manifestations of pneumonia; enlargement of hilar nodes was the principal radiographic finding in these cases.54 Inhalational Tularemia Following Use as a Biological Weapon  Although F tularensis could be used as a weapon in a number of ways, the working group believes that an aerosol release would have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Release in a densely populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of cases of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning 3 to 5 days later (incubation range, 1-14 days), with pleuropneumonitis developing in a significant proportion of cases during the ensuing days and weeks. Public health authorities would most likely become aware of an outbreak of unusual respiratory disease in its early stages, but this could be difficult to distinguish from a natural outbreak of community-acquired infection, especially influenza or various atypical pneumonias. The abrupt onset of large numbers of acutely ill persons, the rapid progression in a relatively high proportion of cases from upper respiratory symptoms and bronchitis to lifethreatening pleuropneumonitis and systemic infection affecting, among others, young, previously healthy adults and children should, however, quickly alert medical professionals and public health authorities to a critical and unexpected public health event and to bioterrorism as a possible cause (TABLE 1). Until the etiology became clear, clinicians would need to work closely with epidemiologists and diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the illness from various community-acquired pneumonias and to determine if it could have resulted from use of one of several potential bioterrorism weapons agents, such as those causing tularemia, plague, anthrax, or Q fever.2,4,29 In general, tularemia would be expected to have a slower progression of illness and a lower case-fatality rate than either inhalational plague or anthrax. Plague would most likely progress very 2765  2001 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Diagnosis of Inhalational Tularemia Following Use of a Biological Weapon Clinical Findings Sudden onset of acute febrile illness, progressing in some patients to pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, hilar lymphadenitis. Complications of overwhelming untreated infection may lead to sepsis and inflammatory response syndrome. Epidemiology Point-source outbreak pattern; likely urban, nonagricultural setting. Unexpected severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy persons. Risk related to degree of exposure with no differences in susceptibility by age or sex. Microbiology Small, gram-negative coccobacilli in direct stain of respiratory secretions. Sputum, tracheobronchial secretions, and blood should be cultured using cysteine-enriched medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates should be determined. Direct fluorescent antibody stain is first-line, rapid identification procedure at reference laboratories. Polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection procedures may also provide rapid identification. Microagglutination assay can detect serum antibodies beginning 10 days after illness onset. Virulence testing and molecular genetic characterizations are performed at specialized laboratories. Pathology Histological findings of acute suppurative necrosis followed by granulomatous reactions. Target organs include lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney. Radiology Peribronchial infiltrates leading to bronchopneumonia in 1 or more lobes, often accompanied by pleural effusion and enlarged hilar nodes. Signs may be absent or minimal, with only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates, or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura.  rapidly to severe pneumonia, with copious watery or purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and shock.4 Inhalational anthrax would be differentiated by its characteristic radiological findings of prominent symmetric mediastinal widening and absence of bronchopneumonia.2 As well, anthrax patients would be expected to develop fulminating, toxic, and fatal illness despite antibiotic treatment.29 Milder forms of inhalational tularemia could be clinically indistinguishable from Q fever; establishing a diagnosis of either would be problematic without reference laboratory testing. Presumptive laboratory diagnoses of plague or anthrax would be expected to be made relatively quickly, although microbiological confirmation could take days. Isolation and identification of F tularensis using routine laboratory procedures could take several weeks. Once a substantial cluster of cases of inhalational tularemia had been identified, epidemiological findings should suggest a bioterrorist event. The abrupt onset and single peak of cases would implicate a point-source exposure without secondary transmission. Among exposed persons, attack rates would likely  be similar across sex and age groups, and risk would be related to degree of exposure to the point source (Table 1). An outbreak of inhalational tularemia in an urban setting should trigger a high level of suspicion of an intentional event, since all reported inhalational tularemia outbreaks have occurred in rural areas. MICROBIOLOGY AND VIRULENCE FACTORS Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus. It has a thin lipopolysaccharide-containing envelope and is a hardy nonspore-forming organism that survives for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying animal carcasses.21,22,60,61 Francisella tularensis has been divided into 2 major subspecies (biovars) by virulence testing, biochemical reactions, and epidemiological features.62 Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) may be highly virulent in humans and animals, produces acid from glycerol, demonstrates citrulline ureidase activity, and is the most common biovar isolated in North America.22,60 Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is relatively avirulent, does not produce acid  from glycerol, and does not demonstrate citrulline ureidase activity. In Europe and Asia, all human tularemia is thought to be caused by the milder type B strains, although recent studies there have identified naturally occurring F tularensis related to F tularensis biovar tularensis. 63,64 A few rapidly growing strains of F tularensis have been recovered from the blood of immunocompromised patients not showing seroreactivity to F tularensis.65 Transformed plasmids have been engineered to express chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance in F tularensis.66 Virulent, streptomycin-resistant F tularensis strains have been examined in biowarfare agent studies both in the United States and the Soviet Union.24,27,56 Although F tularensis virulence factors are poorly understood and characterized,67,68 it is possible that strain virulence could be enhanced through laboratory manipulation. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pathogenesis  Francisella tularensis can infect humans through the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages.68,69 The major target organs are the lymph nodes, lungs and pleura, spleen, liver, and kidney.19,20,49,70-72 Untreated, bacilli inoculated into skin or mucous membranes multiply, spread to the regional lymph nodes and further multiply, and may then disseminate to organs throughout the body. Bacteremia may be common in the early phase of infection. The initial tissue reaction to infection is a focal, intensely suppurative necrosis consisting largely of accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by invasion of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. Suppurative lesions become granulomatous, and histopathological examination of the granulomas shows a central necrotic, sometimes caseating zone surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and fibroblasts in a radial arrange-  2766 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Bronchopneumonia was most pronounced in animals exposed to the smaller particles and was characterized by tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement and reddish, firm, 0.2- to 0.5cm-diameter discrete inflammatory lesions scattered throughout the lungs. In the absence of treatment, the disease progressed to pneumonic consolidation and organization, granuloma formation, and eventual chronic interstitial fibrosis. Humans with inhalational exposures also develop hemorrhagic inflammation of the airways early in the course of illness, which may progress to bronchopneumonia.54 Histopathological examination of affected lungs shows alveolar spaces filled with an exudate of mononuclear cells. Pleuritis with adhesions and effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are common radiological and pathological findings.70,72 Clinical Manifestations  The primary clinical forms of tularemia vary in severity and presentation according to virulence of the infecting organism, dose, and site of inoculum. Primary disease presentations include ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic forms.19,20,49,70,72,74,75 The term typhoidal tularemia has been used to describe illness in tularemia patients with systemic infections manifesting as fever and other constitutional signs without cutaneous or mucosal membrane lesions or regional lymphadenitis. Sometimes, these patients present with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea and pain. Confusion is created when typhoidal tularemia is used to describe the illness in patients infected by  inhalation, especially when there are signs of pleuropneumonic disease; this usage can be misleading and has been discouraged.54,75 The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever (38C-40C), headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. A pulsetemperature dissociation has been noted in as many as 42% of patients.49 A dry or slightly productive cough and substernal pain or tightness frequently occur with or without objective signs of pneumonia, such as purulent sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis.7,19,26,70,74 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea sometimes occur. Sweats, fever and chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. Studies of volunteers have shown that F tularensis aerosol exposures can incapacitate some persons in the first 1 or 2 days of illness, and significant impairment in performing tasks can continue for days after antibiotic treatment is begun.76 In untreated tularemia, symptoms often persist for several weeks and, sometimes, for months, usually with progressive debility. Any form of tularemia may be complicated by hematogenous spread, resulting in secondary pleuropneumonia, sepsis, and, rarely, meningitis.74,77 Prior to the advent of antibiotics, the overall mortality from infections with the more severe type A strains was in the range of 5% to 15%, and fatality rates as high as 30% to 60% were reported for untreated pneumonic and severe systemic forms of disease.72,78 Currently, the overall case-fatality rate of reported cases in the United States is less than 2%.34,49 Type B infections are rarely fatal. In ulceroglandular tularemia, the form that typically arises from handling a contaminated carcass or following an infective arthropod bite, a local cutaneous papule appears at the inoculation site at about the time of onset of generalized symptoms, becomes pustular, and ulcerates within a few days of its first appearance. The ulcer is ten-  Figure 1. Cervical Lymphadenitis in a Patient With Pharyngeal Tularemia  Patient has marked swelling and fluctuant suppuration of several anterior cervical nodes.

Typically, one or more regional afferent lymph nodes may become enlarged and tender within several days of the appearance of the papule. Even with antibiotic treatment, the affected nodes may become fluctuant and rupture. In oculoglandular tularemia, which follows direct contamination of the eye, ulceration occurs on the conjunctiva, accompanied by pronounced chemosis, vasculitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Glandular tularemia is characterized by lymphadenopathy without an ulcer. Oropharyngeal tularemia is acquired by drinking contaminated water, ingesting contaminated food, and, sometimes, by inhaling contaminated droplets or aerosols.14,20,36,43,50,51,79 Affected persons may develop stomatitis but more commonly develop exudative pharyngitis or tonsillitis, sometimes with ulceration. Pronounced cervical or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy may occur (FIGURE 1).74,79 Tularemia pneumonia can be the direct result of inhaling contaminated aerosols or be secondary to hematogenous spread from a distal site. An aerosol release of F tularensis would be expected to result in acute illness with signs and symptoms of 1 or more of pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pleuropneumonitis, and hilar lymphadenitis, accompanied by various manifesta2767  2001 American Medical Association.

Clinicians Caring for Patients With Suspected Tularemia Should Immediately Contact Their: (1) Hospital epidemiologist or infection control practitioner and (2) Local or state health departments Consult your local telephone operator, the telephone directory under ""governmental listings,"" or the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/other .htm#states or http://www.astho.org /state.html If the local and state health departments are unavailable, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (970) 221-6400 or http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid /dvbid.htm  more lobes, and often accompanied by pleural effusions and hilar lymphadenopathy (FIGURE 2).72,75 Signs may, however, be minimal or absent, and some patients will show only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura. Although volunteers challenged with aerosols of virulent F tularensis (type A) regularly developed systemic symptoms of acute illness 3 to 5 days following exposure, only 25% to 50% of participants had radiological evidence of pneumonia in the early stages of infection.7,26 On the other hand, pulmonary infection can sometimes rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.72,80 Lung abscesses occur infrequently.75 Typhoidal tularemia is used to describe systemic illness in the absence of signs indicating either site of inoculation or anatomic localization of infection. This should be differentiated from inhalational tularemia with pleuropneumonic disease.54,75 Tularemia sepsis is potentially severe and fatal. As in typhoidal tularemia, nonspecific findings of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be prominent early in the course of illness. The patient typically appears toxic and may develop confusion and coma. Unless treated promptly, septic shock and other complications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome may ensue, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and organ failure.80 DIAGNOSIS Tularemia in humans occurs infrequently, resulting in a low index of diagnostic suspicion among clinicians and laboratorians. Since rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available, the first indication of intentional tularemia might follow recognition by public health authorities of a clustering of acute, severe respiratory illness with unusual epidemiological features (Table 1). Suspicion of tularemia might be triggered in alert clini-  tions of systemic illness. Inhalational exposures, however, commonly result in an initial clinical picture of systemic illness without prominent signs of respiratory disease.7,43,53,56 The earliest pulmonary radiographic findings of inhalational tularemia may be peribronchial infiltrates, typically advancing to bronchopneumonia in 1 o r  cians encountering patients with findings of atypical pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Identification of F tularensis in clinical specimens may be missed or delayed for days or weeks when procedures for routine microbiological screening of bacterial pathogens are followed, and it is unlikely that a serendipitous laboratory identification would be the sentinel event that alerted authorities to a major bioterrorism action. Physicians who suspect inhalational tularemia should promptly collect specimens of respiratory secretions and blood and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Francisella tularensis may be identified by direct examination of secretions, exudates, or biopsy specimens using direct fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical stains.81-83 By light microscopy, the organism is characterized by its small size (0.2 m 0.2-0.7 m), pleomorphism, and faint staining. It does not show the bipolar staining characteristics of Yersinia pestis,4 the agent of plague, and is easily distinguished from the large gram-positive rods characteristic of vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis (FIGURE 3).2 Microscopic demonstration of F tularensis using fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public Health Laboratory Network; test results can be made available within several hours of receiving the appropriate specimens if the laboratory is alerted and prepared. Suspicion of inhalational tularemia must be promptly reported to local or state public health authorities so timely epidemiological and environmental investigations can be made (BOX). Growth of F tularensis in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia.60,81 Francisella tularensis can be grown from pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, and even fasting gastric aspirates in a high proportion of patients with inhalational tularemia.56 It is only occasionally isolated from the blood.

Although growth may be visible as early as 24 to 48 hours after inoculation, growth may be delayed and cultures should be held for at least 10 days before discarding. Under ideal conditions, bacterial colonies on cysteineenriched agar are typically 1 mm in diameter after 24 to 48 hours of incubation and 3 to 5 mm in diameter by 96 hours.60,81 On cysteine heart agar, F tularensis colonies are characteristically opalescent and do not discolor the medium (FIGURE 4). Antigen detection assays, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassays, immunoblotting, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis, and other specialized techniques may be used to identify F tularensis and to characterize strains.84-87 These procedures are usually performed only in research and reference laboratories, however. In laboratories where advanced methods are  established, results of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction analyses can be obtained within several hours of receipt of isolates. Typically, serum antibody titers do not attain diagnostic levels until 10 or more days after onset of illness, and serology would provide minimal useful information for managing an outbreak. Serological confirmation of cases, however, may be of value for forensic or epidemiological purposes. Most laboratories use tube agglutination or microagglutination tests that detect combined immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.84,85 A 4-fold change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, a single titer of at least 1:160 for tube agglutination or 1:128 for microagglutination is diagnostic for F tularensis infection. Information on reference diagnostic testing and shipping/ handling of specimens can be obtained from state public health laboratories and from the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, Colo (telephone: [970] 221-6400; e-mail: dvbid@cdc.gov). VACCINATION Beginning in the 1930s, t he Soviet Union used a live attenuated vaccine to immunize tens of millions of persons living in tularemia-endemic areas.88 In  Figure 4. Francisella tularensis Growth at 72 Hours After Inoculation  These Francisella tularensis colonies show characteristic opalescence on cysteine heart agar with sheep blood (cultured at 37C for 72 hours). Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  the United States, a live attenuated vaccine derived from the avirulent live vaccine strain has been used to protect laboratorians routinely working with F tularensis; until recently, this vaccine was available as an investigational new drug.89 It is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and its future availability is undetermined. In a retrospective study of civilians working with F tularensis at a US Army research facility, the incidence of accidental acute inhalational tularemia among laboratorians declined from 5.70 cases per 1000 person-years of risk at 2769  2001 American Medical Association.

In volunteer studies, the live attenuated vaccine did not protect all recipients against aerosol challenges with virulent F tularensis.7,26 Correlates of protective immunity appear about 2 weeks following natural infection or vaccination. Given the short incubation period of tularemia and incomplete protection of current vaccines against inhalational tularemia, vaccination is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis. The working group recommends use of the live vaccine strain only for laboratory personnel routinely working with F tularensis. TREATMENT Contained Casualty Situation  Table 3. Working Group Consensus Recommendations for Treatment of Patients With Tularemia in a Mass Casualty Setting and for Postexposure Prophylaxis* Mass Casualty Recommended Therapy Adults Preferred choices Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Children Preferred choices Doxycycline; if 45 kg, give 100 mg orally twice daily; if 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 15 mg/kg orally twice daily Pregnant Women Preferred choices Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily *One antibiotic, appropriate for patient age, should be chosen from among alternatives. The duration of all recommended therapies in Table 3 is 14 days. Not a US Food and Drug Administrationapproved use. Ciprofloxacin dosage should not exceed 1 g/d in children.  Adults. In a contained casualty situation, in which logistics permit individual medical management, the working group recommends parenteral antimicrobial therapy for tularemia (TABLE 2). Streptomycin is the drug of choice.49,74,90,91 Gentamicin, which is more widely available and may be used intravenously, is an acceptable alternative. 49,74,90-93 Treatment with aminoglycosides should be continued for 10 days. Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are also used to treat tularemia49,74,90; however, relapses and primary treatment failures occur at a higher rate with these bacteriostatic agents than with aminoglycosides, and they should be given for at least 14 days to reduce chance of relapse.27,74,90 Fluoroquinolones, which have intracellular activity, are promising candidates for treating tularemia. Ciprofloxacin, which is not labeled for use in tularemia, has been shown to be active against F tularensis in vitro94 and in animals95 and has been used to successfully treat tularemia in both adults and chil-  dren.90,94,96,97 Treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days. In persons beginning treatment with parenteral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, therapy can be switched to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated. Very limited experiences in treating tularemia patients with -lactam and macrolide antibiotics have been reported, and treatment failures have occurred.98 Use of -lactam and macrolide antibiotics in treating tularemia is neither FDA-approved nor recommended by the working group. Children. In children, streptomycin or gentamicin is recommended by the working group as first-line treatment in a contained casualty situation (Table 2). Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin ( 1 g/d), and chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives to aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause cartilage damage in immature animals and are not FDA-approved for use in children. However, short courses of these agents have not been associated with arthropathy in pediatric patients, and the potential risks of their use must be weighed against their benefits in treating serious infections.96,99,100 Mass Casualty Situation  Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, administered orally, are the preferred choices for treatment in the mass casualty setting, for both adults and children (TABLE 3). The ciprofloxacin dosage for children should not exceed 1 g/d. In a mass casualty situation, the working group believes the benefits to children from short courses of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (Table 3) outweigh the risks of their use. Since it is unknown whether drugresistant organisms might be used in a bioterrorist event, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates should be conducted quickly and treatments altered according to test results and clinical responses. Antibiotics for treating patients infected with tularemia in a bioterrorism scenario are included in a national pharmaceutical stockpile  2770 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

In a contained casualty situation, short courses of gentamicin are likely to pose a low risk to fetuses when used to treat tularemia in pregnant women (Table 2). Rare cases of fetal nerve deafness and renal damage have been reported with other aminoglycosides but have not been reported with gentamicin. The benefits of gentamicin in treating pregnant women with tularemia are expected to outweigh any potential risk to fetuses. In a mass casualty situation, oral ciprofloxacin is considered the best alternative to gentamicin for pregnant women (Table 3). Immunosuppressed Persons. There is scant experience in treating tularemia in immunocompromised patients. However, considering the greater occurrence in immunocompetent patients of tularemia relapses and treatment failures following use of bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents compared with aminoglycosides, streptomycin or gentamicin should be used when possible to treat patients with known immune dysfunction in either contained casualty or mass casualty situations (Table 2). POSTEXPOSURE ANTIBIOTIC RECOMMENDATIONS Persons beginning treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin in the incubation period of tularemia and continuing treatment daily for 14 days might be protected against symptomatic infection. In studies of aerosol challenge with infective doses of the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis, each of 8 volunteers given oral dosages of tetracycline, 1 g/d for 28 days, and each of 8 volunteers given tetracycline, 2 g/d for 14 days, were fully protected when treatment was begun 24 hours following challenge.27 Two of 10 volunteers given tetracycline, 1 g/d for only 5 days,  developed symptomatic tularemia after antibiotic treatment was stopped. In the unlikely event that authorities quickly become aware that an F tularensis biological weapon has been used and are able to identify and reach exposed persons during the early incubation period, the working group recommends that exposed persons be prophylactically treated with 14 days of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin (Table 3). In a circumstance in which the weapon attack has been covert and the event is discovered only after persons start to become ill, persons potentially exposed should be instructed to begin a fever watch. Persons who develop an otherwise unexplained fever or flulike illness within 14 days of presumed exposure should begin treatment as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. In the laboratory, persons who have had potentially infective exposures to F tularensis should be administered oral postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis if the risk of infection is high (eg, spill, centrifuge accident, or needlestick). If the risk is low, exposed persons can be placed on a fever watch and treated if they develop symptoms. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment of close contacts of tularemia patients is not recommended since human-to-human transmission of F tularensis is not known to occur. INFECTION CONTROL Isolation is not recommended for tularemia patients, given the lack of human-to-human transmission. In hospitals, standard precautions 101 are recommended by the working group for treatment of patients with tularemia. Microbiology laboratory personnel should be alerted when tularemia is clinically suspected. Routine diagnostic procedures can be performed in biological safety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Examination of cultures in which F tularensis is suspected should be carried out in a biological safety cabinet. Manipulation of cultures and other activities involving infectious materials with a potential for aerosol or droplet production (centrifuging, grinding, vig-  orous shaking, growing cultures in volume, animal studies) require BSL-3 conditions.102 When F tularensis is presumptively identified in a routine BSL-2 clinical laboratory (level A), specimens should be forwarded to a BSL-3 laboratory (level B) (eg, a state public health laboratory) for confirmation of agent and other studies, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.11 Bodies of patients who die of tularemia should be handled using standard precautions. Autopsy procedures likely to cause aerosols, such as bone sawing, should be avoided. Clothing or linens contaminated with body fluids of patients infected with F tularensis should be disinfected per standard precautions protocols.101 ENVIRONMENTAL DECONTAMINATION AND PROTECTION Under natural conditions, F tularensis may survive for extended periods in a cold, moist environment. The working group lacks information on survival of intentionally dispersed particles but would expect a short halflife due to desiccation, solar radiation, oxidation and other environmental factors, and a very limited risk from secondary dispersal. In circumstances of a laboratory spill or intentional use in which authorities are concerned about an environmental risk (eg, inanimate surfaces wet with material thought to contain F tularensis), decontamination can be achieved by spraying the suspected contaminant with a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach and 9 parts water). After 10 minutes, a 70% solution of alcohol can be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action of the bleach. Soap water can be used to flush away less hazardous contaminations. Persons with direct exposure to powder or liquid aerosols containing F tularensis should wash body surfaces and clothing with soap water. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal water sources should protect against waterborne infection.60 Following an urban release, the risk to humans of acquiring tula2771  2001 American Medical Association.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH Simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests that could be used to identify persons infected with F tularensis in the mass exposure setting need to be developed. Further methods should be designed to rapidly define the molecular genetic characteristics of organisms, especially as they may relate to engineered attributes, such as enhanced virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents or normally lethal environmental conditions. Complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of natural strains of F tularensis would provide an archival base for understanding genetic variants, functions of genes, and mechanisms of action useful in developing means to protect against F tularensis. Research is also needed to develop accurate and reliable procedures to rapidly detect F tularensis in environmental samples. New technologies should be explored for developing active (eg, DNAbased) or passive (eg, monoclonal antibodybased) vaccines for rapid preexposure or postexposure protection.

Russell, MD Kevin Tonat, DrPH, MPH for the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality. R. R. Parker1 Objective The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense has developed consensusbased recommendations for measures to be taken by medical and public health professionals if tularemia is used as a biological weapon against a civilian population. Participants The working group included 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions and agencies. Evidence MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2000, using the Medical Subject Headings Francisella tularensis, Pasteurella tularensis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. Consensus Process Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. Conclusions A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period.

The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense considers F tularensis to be a dangerous potential biological weapon because of its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination, and substantial capacity to cause illness and death.8-11 Author Affiliations: National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga (Drs Dennis, Lillibridge, and McDade); Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine (Drs Inglesby, Bartlett, and Perl) and Public Health (Drs Henderson, O'Toole, and Russell), Baltimore, Md; Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Health Services, Berkeley (Dr Ascher); US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, Md (Drs Eitzen, Friedlander, and Parker); Bureau of Communicable Disease, New York City Health Department  CONSENSUS METHODS The working group comprised 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions.

Review of the bibliographies of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other published and unpublished references and sources for review. The first draft of the consensus statement was a synthesis of information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process. Members of the working group were asked to make written comments on this first draft in May 1999. Subsequent revised drafts were reviewed and edited until full consensus of the working group was achieved. HISTORY AND POTENTIAL AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON Tularemia was first described as a plaguelike disease of rodents in 1911 and, shortly thereafter, was recognized as a potentially severe and fatal illness in humans.12 Tularemia's epidemic potential became apparent in the 1930s and 1940s, when large waterborne outbreaks occurred in Europe and the Soviet Union13-15 and epizootic-associated cases occurred in the United States.16,17 As well, F tularensis quickly gained notoriety as a virulent laboratory hazard.18,19 Public health concerns impelled substantial early investigations into tularemia's ecology, microbiology, pathogenicity, and prevention.19-22 Francisella tularensis has long been considered a potential biological weapon. It was one of a number of agents studied at Japanese germ warfare research units operating in Manchuria between 1932 and 194523; it was also examined for military purposes in the West. A former Soviet Union biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibeck, has suggested that tularemia outbreaks affecting tens of thousands of Soviet and German soldiers on the eastern European front during World War II may have been the result of intentional use.24 Following the war, there were continuing military studies of tularemia. In the  1950s and 1960s, the US military developed weapons that would disseminate F tularensis aerosols10; concurrently, it conducted research to better understand the pathophysiology of tularemia and to develop vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment regimens. In some studies, volunteers were infected with F tularensis by direct aerosol delivery systems and by exposures in an aerosol chamber.10 A live attenuated vaccine was developed that partially protected against respiratory and intracutaneous challenges with the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis,6,7 and various regimens of streptomycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol were found to be effective in prophylaxis and treatment.25-27 By the late 1960s, F tularensis was one of several biological weapons stockpiled by the US military.10 According to Alibeck, a large parallel effort by the Soviet Union continued into the early 1990s and resulted in weapons production of F tularensis strains engineered to be resistant to antibiotics and vaccines.24 In 1969, a World Health Organization expert committee estimated that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of virulent F tularensis over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250 000 incapacitating casualties, including 19 000 deaths.28 Illness would be expected to persist for several weeks and disease relapses to occur during the ensuing weeks or months. It was assumed that vaccinated individuals would be only partially protected against an aerosol exposure. Referring to this model, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently examined the expected economic impact of bioterrorist attacks and estimated the total base costs to society of an F tularensis aerosol attack to be $5.4 billion for every 100 000 persons exposed.9 The United States terminated its biological weapons development program by executive order in 1970 and, by 1973, had destroyed its entire biological arsenal.10 Since then, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has been responsible for defensive medical research on F tu-  larensis and other potential biological warfare agents to better protect the US military, including protocols on decontamination, prophylaxis, clinical recognition, laboratory diagnosis, and medical management.29 The CDC operates a national program for bioterrorism preparedness and response that incorporates a broad range of public health partnerships.30,31 EPIDEMIOLOGY Geographic Distribution and Human Exposures  Tularemia occurs throughout much of North America and Eurasia.15,21,22,32 In the United States, human cases have been reported from every state except Hawaii; however, most cases occur in south-central and western states (especially Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).33-35 In Eurasia, the disease is also widely endemic, although the greatest numbers of human cases are reported from northern and central Europe, especially Scandinavian countries and those of the former Soviet Union.36,37 Tularemia is almost entirely a rural disease, although urban and suburban exposures occasionally do occur.38-41 Throughout its range, F tularensis is found in widely diverse animal hosts and habitats and can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation.15,20-22,32 A variety of small mammals, including voles, mice, water rats, squirrels, rabbits, and hares, are natural reservoirs of infection. They acquire infection through bites by ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, and by contact with contaminated environments. Although enzootic cycles of F tularensis typically occur without notice, epizootics with sometimes extensive dieoffs of animal hosts may herald outbreaks of tularemia in humans.16,22,42,43 Humans become infected with F tularensis by various modes, including bites by infective arthropods,42,44-47 handling infectious animal tissues or fluids,17,48,49 direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil,13,20,40,50,51 and inhalation of infective aerosols.43,52-56 Persons of all ages  2764 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Certain activities, such as hunting, trapping, butchering, and farming, are most likely to expose adult men. Laboratory workers are especially vulnerable to infection, either by accidentally inoculating themselves or by inhaling aerosolized organisms.18,22,56-58 Ordinary exposures during examination of an open culture plate can cause infection. Although F tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, its transmission from person to person has not been documented. Incidence  The worldwide incidence of tularemia is not known, and the disease is probably greatly underrecognized and underreported. In the United States, reported cases have dropped sharply from several thousand per year prior to 1950 to less than 200 per year in the 1990s.33-35 Between 1985 and 1992, 1409 cases and 20 deaths were reported in the United States, for a mean of 171 cases per year and a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.34 Persons in all age groups were affected, but most were children younger than 10 years and adults aged 50 years or older. Of 1298 cases for which information on sex was available, 942 (72.6%) occurred in males, and males outnumbered females in all age groups. Most cases occur in June through September, when arthropod-borne transmission is most common.17,35,59 Cases in winter usually occur among hunters and trappers who handle infected animal carcasses.17,35,48 In the United States, cases are mostly sporadic or occur in small clusters34,35,49; in Eurasia, waterborne, arthropod-borne, and airborne outbreaks involving hundreds of persons have been reported.40,43,44,51,53-55 Natural Occurrences of Inhalational Tularemia  The largest recorded airborne tularemia outbreak occurred in 1966-1967 in an extensive farming area of Sweden.43 This outbreak involved more than 600 patients infected with strains of the milder European biovar of F tularensis  (F tularensis biovar palaearctica) [type B]), most of whom acquired infection while doing farm work that created contaminated aerosols. Case exposures and disease onsets occurred during a period of months but peaked during the winter, when rodent-infested hay was being sorted and moved from field storage sites to barns. Among 140 serologically confirmed cases thought to have been infected by inhalation, most had typical acute symptoms of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, and malaise; only 14 (10%) of confirmed patients had symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and chest pains. Patients generally responded well to tetracycline, and no deaths were reported. Inhalational tularemia in the United States has involved only single cases or small clusters of cases, variously resulting from laboratory exposures,18,56,57 disturbance of contaminated animal carcasses,38,39,41 and suspected infective environmental aerosols.41,52 Cases of inhalational tularemia in the United States are thought to be due mostly to the more virulent F tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) and usually follow an acute and severe course, with prominent pneumonitis. Some cases, however, have radiographic evidence of pleuropneumonia with minimal or absent respiratory signs on physical examination.39,41,52 Although airborne F tularensis would be expected to principally cause primary pleuropneumonic infection, some exposures might contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. In the aforementioned Swedish outbreak, conjunctivitis was reported in 26% of 140 confirmed cases and an infected ulcer of the skin was reported in nearly 12%; pharyngitis was reported in 31% and oral ulcers in about 9% of the cases; and 32% of these patients had various exanthemas, such as erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.43 Tularemia outbreaks arising from similar agricultural exposures have been reported from Finland,53 mostly presenting with general constitutional  symptoms rather than specific manifestations of pneumonia; enlargement of hilar nodes was the principal radiographic finding in these cases.54 Inhalational Tularemia Following Use as a Biological Weapon  Although F tularensis could be used as a weapon in a number of ways, the working group believes that an aerosol release would have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Release in a densely populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of cases of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning 3 to 5 days later (incubation range, 1-14 days), with pleuropneumonitis developing in a significant proportion of cases during the ensuing days and weeks. Public health authorities would most likely become aware of an outbreak of unusual respiratory disease in its early stages, but this could be difficult to distinguish from a natural outbreak of community-acquired infection, especially influenza or various atypical pneumonias. The abrupt onset of large numbers of acutely ill persons, the rapid progression in a relatively high proportion of cases from upper respiratory symptoms and bronchitis to lifethreatening pleuropneumonitis and systemic infection affecting, among others, young, previously healthy adults and children should, however, quickly alert medical professionals and public health authorities to a critical and unexpected public health event and to bioterrorism as a possible cause (TABLE 1). Until the etiology became clear, clinicians would need to work closely with epidemiologists and diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the illness from various community-acquired pneumonias and to determine if it could have resulted from use of one of several potential bioterrorism weapons agents, such as those causing tularemia, plague, anthrax, or Q fever.2,4,29 In general, tularemia would be expected to have a slower progression of illness and a lower case-fatality rate than either inhalational plague or anthrax. Plague would most likely progress very 2765  2001 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Diagnosis of Inhalational Tularemia Following Use of a Biological Weapon Clinical Findings Sudden onset of acute febrile illness, progressing in some patients to pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, hilar lymphadenitis. Complications of overwhelming untreated infection may lead to sepsis and inflammatory response syndrome. Epidemiology Point-source outbreak pattern; likely urban, nonagricultural setting. Unexpected severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy persons. Risk related to degree of exposure with no differences in susceptibility by age or sex. Microbiology Small, gram-negative coccobacilli in direct stain of respiratory secretions. Sputum, tracheobronchial secretions, and blood should be cultured using cysteine-enriched medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates should be determined. Direct fluorescent antibody stain is first-line, rapid identification procedure at reference laboratories. Polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection procedures may also provide rapid identification. Microagglutination assay can detect serum antibodies beginning 10 days after illness onset. Virulence testing and molecular genetic characterizations are performed at specialized laboratories. Pathology Histological findings of acute suppurative necrosis followed by granulomatous reactions. Target organs include lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney. Radiology Peribronchial infiltrates leading to bronchopneumonia in 1 or more lobes, often accompanied by pleural effusion and enlarged hilar nodes. Signs may be absent or minimal, with only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates, or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura.  rapidly to severe pneumonia, with copious watery or purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and shock.4 Inhalational anthrax would be differentiated by its characteristic radiological findings of prominent symmetric mediastinal widening and absence of bronchopneumonia.2 As well, anthrax patients would be expected to develop fulminating, toxic, and fatal illness despite antibiotic treatment.29 Milder forms of inhalational tularemia could be clinically indistinguishable from Q fever; establishing a diagnosis of either would be problematic without reference laboratory testing. Presumptive laboratory diagnoses of plague or anthrax would be expected to be made relatively quickly, although microbiological confirmation could take days. Isolation and identification of F tularensis using routine laboratory procedures could take several weeks. Once a substantial cluster of cases of inhalational tularemia had been identified, epidemiological findings should suggest a bioterrorist event. The abrupt onset and single peak of cases would implicate a point-source exposure without secondary transmission. Among exposed persons, attack rates would likely  be similar across sex and age groups, and risk would be related to degree of exposure to the point source (Table 1). An outbreak of inhalational tularemia in an urban setting should trigger a high level of suspicion of an intentional event, since all reported inhalational tularemia outbreaks have occurred in rural areas. MICROBIOLOGY AND VIRULENCE FACTORS Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus. It has a thin lipopolysaccharide-containing envelope and is a hardy nonspore-forming organism that survives for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying animal carcasses.21,22,60,61 Francisella tularensis has been divided into 2 major subspecies (biovars) by virulence testing, biochemical reactions, and epidemiological features.62 Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) may be highly virulent in humans and animals, produces acid from glycerol, demonstrates citrulline ureidase activity, and is the most common biovar isolated in North America.22,60 Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is relatively avirulent, does not produce acid  from glycerol, and does not demonstrate citrulline ureidase activity. In Europe and Asia, all human tularemia is thought to be caused by the milder type B strains, although recent studies there have identified naturally occurring F tularensis related to F tularensis biovar tularensis. 63,64 A few rapidly growing strains of F tularensis have been recovered from the blood of immunocompromised patients not showing seroreactivity to F tularensis.65 Transformed plasmids have been engineered to express chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance in F tularensis.66 Virulent, streptomycin-resistant F tularensis strains have been examined in biowarfare agent studies both in the United States and the Soviet Union.24,27,56 Although F tularensis virulence factors are poorly understood and characterized,67,68 it is possible that strain virulence could be enhanced through laboratory manipulation. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pathogenesis  Francisella tularensis can infect humans through the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages.68,69 The major target organs are the lymph nodes, lungs and pleura, spleen, liver, and kidney.19,20,49,70-72 Untreated, bacilli inoculated into skin or mucous membranes multiply, spread to the regional lymph nodes and further multiply, and may then disseminate to organs throughout the body. Bacteremia may be common in the early phase of infection. The initial tissue reaction to infection is a focal, intensely suppurative necrosis consisting largely of accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by invasion of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. Suppurative lesions become granulomatous, and histopathological examination of the granulomas shows a central necrotic, sometimes caseating zone surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and fibroblasts in a radial arrange-  2766 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Bronchopneumonia was most pronounced in animals exposed to the smaller particles and was characterized by tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement and reddish, firm, 0.2- to 0.5cm-diameter discrete inflammatory lesions scattered throughout the lungs. In the absence of treatment, the disease progressed to pneumonic consolidation and organization, granuloma formation, and eventual chronic interstitial fibrosis. Humans with inhalational exposures also develop hemorrhagic inflammation of the airways early in the course of illness, which may progress to bronchopneumonia.54 Histopathological examination of affected lungs shows alveolar spaces filled with an exudate of mononuclear cells. Pleuritis with adhesions and effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are common radiological and pathological findings.70,72 Clinical Manifestations  The primary clinical forms of tularemia vary in severity and presentation according to virulence of the infecting organism, dose, and site of inoculum. Primary disease presentations include ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic forms.19,20,49,70,72,74,75 The term typhoidal tularemia has been used to describe illness in tularemia patients with systemic infections manifesting as fever and other constitutional signs without cutaneous or mucosal membrane lesions or regional lymphadenitis. Sometimes, these patients present with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea and pain. Confusion is created when typhoidal tularemia is used to describe the illness in patients infected by  inhalation, especially when there are signs of pleuropneumonic disease; this usage can be misleading and has been discouraged.54,75 The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever (38C-40C), headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. A pulsetemperature dissociation has been noted in as many as 42% of patients.49 A dry or slightly productive cough and substernal pain or tightness frequently occur with or without objective signs of pneumonia, such as purulent sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis.7,19,26,70,74 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea sometimes occur. Sweats, fever and chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. Studies of volunteers have shown that F tularensis aerosol exposures can incapacitate some persons in the first 1 or 2 days of illness, and significant impairment in performing tasks can continue for days after antibiotic treatment is begun.76 In untreated tularemia, symptoms often persist for several weeks and, sometimes, for months, usually with progressive debility. Any form of tularemia may be complicated by hematogenous spread, resulting in secondary pleuropneumonia, sepsis, and, rarely, meningitis.74,77 Prior to the advent of antibiotics, the overall mortality from infections with the more severe type A strains was in the range of 5% to 15%, and fatality rates as high as 30% to 60% were reported for untreated pneumonic and severe systemic forms of disease.72,78 Currently, the overall case-fatality rate of reported cases in the United States is less than 2%.34,49 Type B infections are rarely fatal. In ulceroglandular tularemia, the form that typically arises from handling a contaminated carcass or following an infective arthropod bite, a local cutaneous papule appears at the inoculation site at about the time of onset of generalized symptoms, becomes pustular, and ulcerates within a few days of its first appearance. The ulcer is ten-  Figure 1. Cervical Lymphadenitis in a Patient With Pharyngeal Tularemia  Patient has marked swelling and fluctuant suppuration of several anterior cervical nodes.

Typically, one or more regional afferent lymph nodes may become enlarged and tender within several days of the appearance of the papule. Even with antibiotic treatment, the affected nodes may become fluctuant and rupture. In oculoglandular tularemia, which follows direct contamination of the eye, ulceration occurs on the conjunctiva, accompanied by pronounced chemosis, vasculitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Glandular tularemia is characterized by lymphadenopathy without an ulcer. Oropharyngeal tularemia is acquired by drinking contaminated water, ingesting contaminated food, and, sometimes, by inhaling contaminated droplets or aerosols.14,20,36,43,50,51,79 Affected persons may develop stomatitis but more commonly develop exudative pharyngitis or tonsillitis, sometimes with ulceration. Pronounced cervical or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy may occur (FIGURE 1).74,79 Tularemia pneumonia can be the direct result of inhaling contaminated aerosols or be secondary to hematogenous spread from a distal site. An aerosol release of F tularensis would be expected to result in acute illness with signs and symptoms of 1 or more of pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pleuropneumonitis, and hilar lymphadenitis, accompanied by various manifesta2767  2001 American Medical Association.

Clinicians Caring for Patients With Suspected Tularemia Should Immediately Contact Their: (1) Hospital epidemiologist or infection control practitioner and (2) Local or state health departments Consult your local telephone operator, the telephone directory under ""governmental listings,"" or the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/other .htm#states or http://www.astho.org /state.html If the local and state health departments are unavailable, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (970) 221-6400 or http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid /dvbid.htm  more lobes, and often accompanied by pleural effusions and hilar lymphadenopathy (FIGURE 2).72,75 Signs may, however, be minimal or absent, and some patients will show only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura. Although volunteers challenged with aerosols of virulent F tularensis (type A) regularly developed systemic symptoms of acute illness 3 to 5 days following exposure, only 25% to 50% of participants had radiological evidence of pneumonia in the early stages of infection.7,26 On the other hand, pulmonary infection can sometimes rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.72,80 Lung abscesses occur infrequently.75 Typhoidal tularemia is used to describe systemic illness in the absence of signs indicating either site of inoculation or anatomic localization of infection. This should be differentiated from inhalational tularemia with pleuropneumonic disease.54,75 Tularemia sepsis is potentially severe and fatal. As in typhoidal tularemia, nonspecific findings of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be prominent early in the course of illness. The patient typically appears toxic and may develop confusion and coma. Unless treated promptly, septic shock and other complications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome may ensue, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and organ failure.80 DIAGNOSIS Tularemia in humans occurs infrequently, resulting in a low index of diagnostic suspicion among clinicians and laboratorians. Since rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available, the first indication of intentional tularemia might follow recognition by public health authorities of a clustering of acute, severe respiratory illness with unusual epidemiological features (Table 1). Suspicion of tularemia might be triggered in alert clini-  tions of systemic illness. Inhalational exposures, however, commonly result in an initial clinical picture of systemic illness without prominent signs of respiratory disease.7,43,53,56 The earliest pulmonary radiographic findings of inhalational tularemia may be peribronchial infiltrates, typically advancing to bronchopneumonia in 1 o r  cians encountering patients with findings of atypical pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Identification of F tularensis in clinical specimens may be missed or delayed for days or weeks when procedures for routine microbiological screening of bacterial pathogens are followed, and it is unlikely that a serendipitous laboratory identification would be the sentinel event that alerted authorities to a major bioterrorism action. Physicians who suspect inhalational tularemia should promptly collect specimens of respiratory secretions and blood and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Francisella tularensis may be identified by direct examination of secretions, exudates, or biopsy specimens using direct fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical stains.81-83 By light microscopy, the organism is characterized by its small size (0.2 m 0.2-0.7 m), pleomorphism, and faint staining. It does not show the bipolar staining characteristics of Yersinia pestis,4 the agent of plague, and is easily distinguished from the large gram-positive rods characteristic of vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis (FIGURE 3).2 Microscopic demonstration of F tularensis using fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public Health Laboratory Network; test results can be made available within several hours of receiving the appropriate specimens if the laboratory is alerted and prepared. Suspicion of inhalational tularemia must be promptly reported to local or state public health authorities so timely epidemiological and environmental investigations can be made (BOX). Growth of F tularensis in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia.60,81 Francisella tularensis can be grown from pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, and even fasting gastric aspirates in a high proportion of patients with inhalational tularemia.56 It is only occasionally isolated from the blood.

Selective agar (such as chocolate agar selective for Neisseria gonorrhea isolation) may be useful when culturing materials from nonsterile sites, such as sputum. Inoculated media should be incubated at 37C. Although growth may be visible as early as 24 to 48 hours after inoculation, growth may be delayed and cultures should be held for at least 10 days before discarding. Under ideal conditions, bacterial colonies on cysteineenriched agar are typically 1 mm in diameter after 24 to 48 hours of incubation and 3 to 5 mm in diameter by 96 hours.60,81 On cysteine heart agar, F tularensis colonies are characteristically opalescent and do not discolor the medium (FIGURE 4). Antigen detection assays, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassays, immunoblotting, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis, and other specialized techniques may be used to identify F tularensis and to characterize strains.84-87 These procedures are usually performed only in research and reference laboratories, however. In laboratories where advanced methods are  established, results of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction analyses can be obtained within several hours of receipt of isolates. Typically, serum antibody titers do not attain diagnostic levels until 10 or more days after onset of illness, and serology would provide minimal useful information for managing an outbreak. Serological confirmation of cases, however, may be of value for forensic or epidemiological purposes. Most laboratories use tube agglutination or microagglutination tests that detect combined immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.84,85 A 4-fold change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, a single titer of at least 1:160 for tube agglutination or 1:128 for microagglutination is diagnostic for F tularensis infection. Information on reference diagnostic testing and shipping/ handling of specimens can be obtained from state public health laboratories and from the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, Colo (telephone: [970] 221-6400; e-mail: dvbid@cdc.gov). VACCINATION Beginning in the 1930s, t he Soviet Union used a live attenuated vaccine to immunize tens of millions of persons living in tularemia-endemic areas.88 In  Figure 4.

In a retrospective study of civilians working with F tularensis at a US Army research facility, the incidence of accidental acute inhalational tularemia among laboratorians declined from 5.70 cases per 1000 person-years of risk at 2769  2001 American Medical Association.

In volunteer studies, the live attenuated vaccine did not protect all recipients against aerosol challenges with virulent F tularensis.7,26 Correlates of protective immunity appear about 2 weeks following natural infection or vaccination. Given the short incubation period of tularemia and incomplete protection of current vaccines against inhalational tularemia, vaccination is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis. The working group recommends use of the live vaccine strain only for laboratory personnel routinely working with F tularensis. TREATMENT Contained Casualty Situation  Table 3. Working Group Consensus Recommendations for Treatment of Patients With Tularemia in a Mass Casualty Setting and for Postexposure Prophylaxis* Mass Casualty Recommended Therapy Adults Preferred choices Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Children Preferred choices Doxycycline; if 45 kg, give 100 mg orally twice daily; if 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 15 mg/kg orally twice daily Pregnant Women Preferred choices Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily *One antibiotic, appropriate for patient age, should be chosen from among alternatives. The duration of all recommended therapies in Table 3 is 14 days. Not a US Food and Drug Administrationapproved use. Ciprofloxacin dosage should not exceed 1 g/d in children.  Adults. In a contained casualty situation, in which logistics permit individual medical management, the working group recommends parenteral antimicrobial therapy for tularemia (TABLE 2). Streptomycin is the drug of choice.49,74,90,91 Gentamicin, which is more widely available and may be used intravenously, is an acceptable alternative. 49,74,90-93 Treatment with aminoglycosides should be continued for 10 days. Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are also used to treat tularemia49,74,90; however, relapses and primary treatment failures occur at a higher rate with these bacteriostatic agents than with aminoglycosides, and they should be given for at least 14 days to reduce chance of relapse.27,74,90 Fluoroquinolones, which have intracellular activity, are promising candidates for treating tularemia. Ciprofloxacin, which is not labeled for use in tularemia, has been shown to be active against F tularensis in vitro94 and in animals95 and has been used to successfully treat tularemia in both adults and chil-  dren.90,94,96,97 Treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days. In persons beginning treatment with parenteral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, therapy can be switched to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated. Very limited experiences in treating tularemia patients with -lactam and macrolide antibiotics have been reported, and treatment failures have occurred.98 Use of -lactam and macrolide antibiotics in treating tularemia is neither FDA-approved nor recommended by the working group. Children. In children, streptomycin or gentamicin is recommended by the working group as first-line treatment in a contained casualty situation (Table 2). Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin ( 1 g/d), and chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives to aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause cartilage damage in immature animals and are not FDA-approved for use in children. However, short courses of these agents have not been associated with arthropathy in pediatric patients, and the potential risks of their use must be weighed against their benefits in treating serious infections.96,99,100 Mass Casualty Situation  Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, administered orally, are the preferred choices for treatment in the mass casualty setting, for both adults and children (TABLE 3). The ciprofloxacin dosage for children should not exceed 1 g/d. In a mass casualty situation, the working group believes the benefits to children from short courses of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (Table 3) outweigh the risks of their use. Since it is unknown whether drugresistant organisms might be used in a bioterrorist event, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates should be conducted quickly and treatments altered according to test results and clinical responses. Antibiotics for treating patients infected with tularemia in a bioterrorism scenario are included in a national pharmaceutical stockpile  2770 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

In a contained casualty situation, short courses of gentamicin are likely to pose a low risk to fetuses when used to treat tularemia in pregnant women (Table 2). Rare cases of fetal nerve deafness and renal damage have been reported with other aminoglycosides but have not been reported with gentamicin. The benefits of gentamicin in treating pregnant women with tularemia are expected to outweigh any potential risk to fetuses. In a mass casualty situation, oral ciprofloxacin is considered the best alternative to gentamicin for pregnant women (Table 3). Immunosuppressed Persons. There is scant experience in treating tularemia in immunocompromised patients. However, considering the greater occurrence in immunocompetent patients of tularemia relapses and treatment failures following use of bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents compared with aminoglycosides, streptomycin or gentamicin should be used when possible to treat patients with known immune dysfunction in either contained casualty or mass casualty situations (Table 2). POSTEXPOSURE ANTIBIOTIC RECOMMENDATIONS Persons beginning treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin in the incubation period of tularemia and continuing treatment daily for 14 days might be protected against symptomatic infection. In studies of aerosol challenge with infective doses of the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis, each of 8 volunteers given oral dosages of tetracycline, 1 g/d for 28 days, and each of 8 volunteers given tetracycline, 2 g/d for 14 days, were fully protected when treatment was begun 24 hours following challenge.27 Two of 10 volunteers given tetracycline, 1 g/d for only 5 days,  developed symptomatic tularemia after antibiotic treatment was stopped. In the unlikely event that authorities quickly become aware that an F tularensis biological weapon has been used and are able to identify and reach exposed persons during the early incubation period, the working group recommends that exposed persons be prophylactically treated with 14 days of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin (Table 3). In a circumstance in which the weapon attack has been covert and the event is discovered only after persons start to become ill, persons potentially exposed should be instructed to begin a fever watch. Persons who develop an otherwise unexplained fever or flulike illness within 14 days of presumed exposure should begin treatment as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. In the laboratory, persons who have had potentially infective exposures to F tularensis should be administered oral postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis if the risk of infection is high (eg, spill, centrifuge accident, or needlestick). If the risk is low, exposed persons can be placed on a fever watch and treated if they develop symptoms. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment of close contacts of tularemia patients is not recommended since human-to-human transmission of F tularensis is not known to occur. INFECTION CONTROL Isolation is not recommended for tularemia patients, given the lack of human-to-human transmission. In hospitals, standard precautions 101 are recommended by the working group for treatment of patients with tularemia. Microbiology laboratory personnel should be alerted when tularemia is clinically suspected. Routine diagnostic procedures can be performed in biological safety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Examination of cultures in which F tularensis is suspected should be carried out in a biological safety cabinet. Manipulation of cultures and other activities involving infectious materials with a potential for aerosol or droplet production (centrifuging, grinding, vig-  orous shaking, growing cultures in volume, animal studies) require BSL-3 conditions.102 When F tularensis is presumptively identified in a routine BSL-2 clinical laboratory (level A), specimens should be forwarded to a BSL-3 laboratory (level B) (eg, a state public health laboratory) for confirmation of agent and other studies, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.11 Bodies of patients who die of tularemia should be handled using standard precautions. Autopsy procedures likely to cause aerosols, such as bone sawing, should be avoided. Clothing or linens contaminated with body fluids of patients infected with F tularensis should be disinfected per standard precautions protocols.101 ENVIRONMENTAL DECONTAMINATION AND PROTECTION Under natural conditions, F tularensis may survive for extended periods in a cold, moist environment. The working group lacks information on survival of intentionally dispersed particles but would expect a short halflife due to desiccation, solar radiation, oxidation and other environmental factors, and a very limited risk from secondary dispersal. In circumstances of a laboratory spill or intentional use in which authorities are concerned about an environmental risk (eg, inanimate surfaces wet with material thought to contain F tularensis), decontamination can be achieved by spraying the suspected contaminant with a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach and 9 parts water). After 10 minutes, a 70% solution of alcohol can be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action of the bleach. Soap water can be used to flush away less hazardous contaminations. Persons with direct exposure to powder or liquid aerosols containing F tularensis should wash body surfaces and clothing with soap water. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal water sources should protect against waterborne infection.60 Following an urban release, the risk to humans of acquiring tula2771  2001 American Medical Association.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH Simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests that could be used to identify persons infected with F tularensis in the mass exposure setting need to be developed. Further methods should be designed to rapidly define the molecular genetic characteristics of organisms, especially as they may relate to engineered attributes, such as enhanced virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents or normally lethal environmental conditions. Complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of natural strains of F tularensis would provide an archival base for understanding genetic variants, functions of genes, and mechanisms of action useful in developing means to protect against F tularensis. Research is also needed to develop accurate and reliable procedures to rapidly detect F tularensis in environmental samples. New technologies should be explored for developing active (eg, DNAbased) or passive (eg, monoclonal antibodybased) vaccines for rapid preexposure or postexposure protection.

Russell, MD Kevin Tonat, DrPH, MPH for the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense I know of no other infection of animals communicable to man that can be acquired from sources so numerous and so diverse. In short, one can but feel that the status of tularemia, both as a disease in nature and of man, is one of potentiality. R. R. Parker1 Objective The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense has developed consensusbased recommendations for measures to be taken by medical and public health professionals if tularemia is used as a biological weapon against a civilian population. Participants The working group included 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions and agencies. Evidence MEDLINE databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2000, using the Medical Subject Headings Francisella tularensis, Pasteurella tularensis, biological weapon, biological terrorism, bioterrorism, biological warfare, and biowarfare. Review of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other references and sources. Consensus Process Three formal drafts of the statement that synthesized information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process were reviewed by members of the working group. Consensus was achieved on the final draft. Conclusions A weapon using airborne tularemia would likely result 3 to 5 days later in an outbreak of acute, undifferentiated febrile illness with incipient pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Specific epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings should lead to early suspicion of intentional tularemia in an alert health system; laboratory confirmation of agent could be delayed. Without treatment, the clinical course could progress to respiratory failure, shock, and death. Prompt treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin is recommended. Prophylactic use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the early postexposure period.

The Working Group on Civilian Biodefense considers F tularensis to be a dangerous potential biological weapon because of its extreme infectivity, ease of dissemination, and substantial capacity to cause illness and death.8-11 Author Affiliations: National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga (Drs Dennis, Lillibridge, and McDade); Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine (Drs Inglesby, Bartlett, and Perl) and Public Health (Drs Henderson, O'Toole, and Russell), Baltimore, Md; Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Health Services, Berkeley (Dr Ascher); US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft Detrick, Md (Drs Eitzen, Friedlander, and Parker); Bureau of Communicable Disease, New York City Health Department  CONSENSUS METHODS The working group comprised 25 representatives from academic medical centers, civilian and military governmental agencies, and other public health and emergency management institutions.

Review of the bibliographies of these references led to identification of relevant materials published prior to 1966. In addition, participants identified other published and unpublished references and sources for review. The first draft of the consensus statement was a synthesis of information obtained in the formal evidence-gathering process. Members of the working group were asked to make written comments on this first draft in May 1999. Subsequent revised drafts were reviewed and edited until full consensus of the working group was achieved. HISTORY AND POTENTIAL AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON Tularemia was first described as a plaguelike disease of rodents in 1911 and, shortly thereafter, was recognized as a potentially severe and fatal illness in humans.12 Tularemia's epidemic potential became apparent in the 1930s and 1940s, when large waterborne outbreaks occurred in Europe and the Soviet Union13-15 and epizootic-associated cases occurred in the United States.16,17 As well, F tularensis quickly gained notoriety as a virulent laboratory hazard.18,19 Public health concerns impelled substantial early investigations into tularemia's ecology, microbiology, pathogenicity, and prevention.19-22 Francisella tularensis has long been considered a potential biological weapon. It was one of a number of agents studied at Japanese germ warfare research units operating in Manchuria between 1932 and 194523; it was also examined for military purposes in the West. A former Soviet Union biological weapons scientist, Ken Alibeck, has suggested that tularemia outbreaks affecting tens of thousands of Soviet and German soldiers on the eastern European front during World War II may have been the result of intentional use.24 Following the war, there were continuing military studies of tularemia. In the  1950s and 1960s, the US military developed weapons that would disseminate F tularensis aerosols10; concurrently, it conducted research to better understand the pathophysiology of tularemia and to develop vaccines and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment regimens. In some studies, volunteers were infected with F tularensis by direct aerosol delivery systems and by exposures in an aerosol chamber.10 A live attenuated vaccine was developed that partially protected against respiratory and intracutaneous challenges with the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis,6,7 and various regimens of streptomycin, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol were found to be effective in prophylaxis and treatment.25-27 By the late 1960s, F tularensis was one of several biological weapons stockpiled by the US military.10 According to Alibeck, a large parallel effort by the Soviet Union continued into the early 1990s and resulted in weapons production of F tularensis strains engineered to be resistant to antibiotics and vaccines.24 In 1969, a World Health Organization expert committee estimated that an aerosol dispersal of 50 kg of virulent F tularensis over a metropolitan area with 5 million inhabitants would result in 250 000 incapacitating casualties, including 19 000 deaths.28 Illness would be expected to persist for several weeks and disease relapses to occur during the ensuing weeks or months. It was assumed that vaccinated individuals would be only partially protected against an aerosol exposure. Referring to this model, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently examined the expected economic impact of bioterrorist attacks and estimated the total base costs to society of an F tularensis aerosol attack to be $5.4 billion for every 100 000 persons exposed.9 The United States terminated its biological weapons development program by executive order in 1970 and, by 1973, had destroyed its entire biological arsenal.10 Since then, the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has been responsible for defensive medical research on F tu-  larensis and other potential biological warfare agents to better protect the US military, including protocols on decontamination, prophylaxis, clinical recognition, laboratory diagnosis, and medical management.29 The CDC operates a national program for bioterrorism preparedness and response that incorporates a broad range of public health partnerships.30,31 EPIDEMIOLOGY Geographic Distribution and Human Exposures  Tularemia occurs throughout much of North America and Eurasia.15,21,22,32 In the United States, human cases have been reported from every state except Hawaii; however, most cases occur in south-central and western states (especially Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).33-35 In Eurasia, the disease is also widely endemic, although the greatest numbers of human cases are reported from northern and central Europe, especially Scandinavian countries and those of the former Soviet Union.36,37 Tularemia is almost entirely a rural disease, although urban and suburban exposures occasionally do occur.38-41 Throughout its range, F tularensis is found in widely diverse animal hosts and habitats and can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation.15,20-22,32 A variety of small mammals, including voles, mice, water rats, squirrels, rabbits, and hares, are natural reservoirs of infection. They acquire infection through bites by ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, and by contact with contaminated environments. Although enzootic cycles of F tularensis typically occur without notice, epizootics with sometimes extensive dieoffs of animal hosts may herald outbreaks of tularemia in humans.16,22,42,43 Humans become infected with F tularensis by various modes, including bites by infective arthropods,42,44-47 handling infectious animal tissues or fluids,17,48,49 direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil,13,20,40,50,51 and inhalation of infective aerosols.43,52-56 Persons of all ages  2764 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Certain activities, such as hunting, trapping, butchering, and farming, are most likely to expose adult men. Laboratory workers are especially vulnerable to infection, either by accidentally inoculating themselves or by inhaling aerosolized organisms.18,22,56-58 Ordinary exposures during examination of an open culture plate can cause infection. Although F tularensis is highly infectious and pathogenic, its transmission from person to person has not been documented. Incidence  The worldwide incidence of tularemia is not known, and the disease is probably greatly underrecognized and underreported. In the United States, reported cases have dropped sharply from several thousand per year prior to 1950 to less than 200 per year in the 1990s.33-35 Between 1985 and 1992, 1409 cases and 20 deaths were reported in the United States, for a mean of 171 cases per year and a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.34 Persons in all age groups were affected, but most were children younger than 10 years and adults aged 50 years or older. Of 1298 cases for which information on sex was available, 942 (72.6%) occurred in males, and males outnumbered females in all age groups. Most cases occur in June through September, when arthropod-borne transmission is most common.17,35,59 Cases in winter usually occur among hunters and trappers who handle infected animal carcasses.17,35,48 In the United States, cases are mostly sporadic or occur in small clusters34,35,49; in Eurasia, waterborne, arthropod-borne, and airborne outbreaks involving hundreds of persons have been reported.40,43,44,51,53-55 Natural Occurrences of Inhalational Tularemia  The largest recorded airborne tularemia outbreak occurred in 1966-1967 in an extensive farming area of Sweden.43 This outbreak involved more than 600 patients infected with strains of the milder European biovar of F tularensis  (F tularensis biovar palaearctica) [type B]), most of whom acquired infection while doing farm work that created contaminated aerosols. Case exposures and disease onsets occurred during a period of months but peaked during the winter, when rodent-infested hay was being sorted and moved from field storage sites to barns. Among 140 serologically confirmed cases thought to have been infected by inhalation, most had typical acute symptoms of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, and malaise; only 14 (10%) of confirmed patients had symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and chest pains. Patients generally responded well to tetracycline, and no deaths were reported. Inhalational tularemia in the United States has involved only single cases or small clusters of cases, variously resulting from laboratory exposures,18,56,57 disturbance of contaminated animal carcasses,38,39,41 and suspected infective environmental aerosols.41,52 Cases of inhalational tularemia in the United States are thought to be due mostly to the more virulent F tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) and usually follow an acute and severe course, with prominent pneumonitis. Some cases, however, have radiographic evidence of pleuropneumonia with minimal or absent respiratory signs on physical examination.39,41,52 Although airborne F tularensis would be expected to principally cause primary pleuropneumonic infection, some exposures might contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause oropharyngeal disease with cervical lymphadenitis. In the aforementioned Swedish outbreak, conjunctivitis was reported in 26% of 140 confirmed cases and an infected ulcer of the skin was reported in nearly 12%; pharyngitis was reported in 31% and oral ulcers in about 9% of the cases; and 32% of these patients had various exanthemas, such as erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.43 Tularemia outbreaks arising from similar agricultural exposures have been reported from Finland,53 mostly presenting with general constitutional  symptoms rather than specific manifestations of pneumonia; enlargement of hilar nodes was the principal radiographic finding in these cases.54 Inhalational Tularemia Following Use as a Biological Weapon  Although F tularensis could be used as a weapon in a number of ways, the working group believes that an aerosol release would have the greatest adverse medical and public health consequences. Release in a densely populated area would be expected to result in an abrupt onset of large numbers of cases of acute, nonspecific febrile illness beginning 3 to 5 days later (incubation range, 1-14 days), with pleuropneumonitis developing in a significant proportion of cases during the ensuing days and weeks. Public health authorities would most likely become aware of an outbreak of unusual respiratory disease in its early stages, but this could be difficult to distinguish from a natural outbreak of community-acquired infection, especially influenza or various atypical pneumonias. The abrupt onset of large numbers of acutely ill persons, the rapid progression in a relatively high proportion of cases from upper respiratory symptoms and bronchitis to lifethreatening pleuropneumonitis and systemic infection affecting, among others, young, previously healthy adults and children should, however, quickly alert medical professionals and public health authorities to a critical and unexpected public health event and to bioterrorism as a possible cause (TABLE 1). Until the etiology became clear, clinicians would need to work closely with epidemiologists and diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the illness from various community-acquired pneumonias and to determine if it could have resulted from use of one of several potential bioterrorism weapons agents, such as those causing tularemia, plague, anthrax, or Q fever.2,4,29 In general, tularemia would be expected to have a slower progression of illness and a lower case-fatality rate than either inhalational plague or anthrax. Plague would most likely progress very 2765  2001 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Diagnosis of Inhalational Tularemia Following Use of a Biological Weapon Clinical Findings Sudden onset of acute febrile illness, progressing in some patients to pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, pleuritis, hilar lymphadenitis. Complications of overwhelming untreated infection may lead to sepsis and inflammatory response syndrome. Epidemiology Point-source outbreak pattern; likely urban, nonagricultural setting. Unexpected severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy persons. Risk related to degree of exposure with no differences in susceptibility by age or sex. Microbiology Small, gram-negative coccobacilli in direct stain of respiratory secretions. Sputum, tracheobronchial secretions, and blood should be cultured using cysteine-enriched medium. Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates should be determined. Direct fluorescent antibody stain is first-line, rapid identification procedure at reference laboratories. Polymerase chain reaction and antigen detection procedures may also provide rapid identification. Microagglutination assay can detect serum antibodies beginning 10 days after illness onset. Virulence testing and molecular genetic characterizations are performed at specialized laboratories. Pathology Histological findings of acute suppurative necrosis followed by granulomatous reactions. Target organs include lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and kidney. Radiology Peribronchial infiltrates leading to bronchopneumonia in 1 or more lobes, often accompanied by pleural effusion and enlarged hilar nodes. Signs may be absent or minimal, with only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates, or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura.  rapidly to severe pneumonia, with copious watery or purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, and shock.4 Inhalational anthrax would be differentiated by its characteristic radiological findings of prominent symmetric mediastinal widening and absence of bronchopneumonia.2 As well, anthrax patients would be expected to develop fulminating, toxic, and fatal illness despite antibiotic treatment.29 Milder forms of inhalational tularemia could be clinically indistinguishable from Q fever; establishing a diagnosis of either would be problematic without reference laboratory testing. Presumptive laboratory diagnoses of plague or anthrax would be expected to be made relatively quickly, although microbiological confirmation could take days. Isolation and identification of F tularensis using routine laboratory procedures could take several weeks. Once a substantial cluster of cases of inhalational tularemia had been identified, epidemiological findings should suggest a bioterrorist event. The abrupt onset and single peak of cases would implicate a point-source exposure without secondary transmission. Among exposed persons, attack rates would likely  be similar across sex and age groups, and risk would be related to degree of exposure to the point source (Table 1). An outbreak of inhalational tularemia in an urban setting should trigger a high level of suspicion of an intentional event, since all reported inhalational tularemia outbreaks have occurred in rural areas. MICROBIOLOGY AND VIRULENCE FACTORS Francisella tularensis is a small, nonmotile, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus. It has a thin lipopolysaccharide-containing envelope and is a hardy nonspore-forming organism that survives for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, hay, straw, and decaying animal carcasses.21,22,60,61 Francisella tularensis has been divided into 2 major subspecies (biovars) by virulence testing, biochemical reactions, and epidemiological features.62 Francisella tularensis biovar tularensis (type A) may be highly virulent in humans and animals, produces acid from glycerol, demonstrates citrulline ureidase activity, and is the most common biovar isolated in North America.22,60 Francisella tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is relatively avirulent, does not produce acid  from glycerol, and does not demonstrate citrulline ureidase activity. In Europe and Asia, all human tularemia is thought to be caused by the milder type B strains, although recent studies there have identified naturally occurring F tularensis related to F tularensis biovar tularensis. 63,64 A few rapidly growing strains of F tularensis have been recovered from the blood of immunocompromised patients not showing seroreactivity to F tularensis.65 Transformed plasmids have been engineered to express chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance in F tularensis.66 Virulent, streptomycin-resistant F tularensis strains have been examined in biowarfare agent studies both in the United States and the Soviet Union.24,27,56 Although F tularensis virulence factors are poorly understood and characterized,67,68 it is possible that strain virulence could be enhanced through laboratory manipulation. PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pathogenesis  Francisella tularensis can infect humans through the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages.68,69 The major target organs are the lymph nodes, lungs and pleura, spleen, liver, and kidney.19,20,49,70-72 Untreated, bacilli inoculated into skin or mucous membranes multiply, spread to the regional lymph nodes and further multiply, and may then disseminate to organs throughout the body. Bacteremia may be common in the early phase of infection. The initial tissue reaction to infection is a focal, intensely suppurative necrosis consisting largely of accumulations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, followed by invasion of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. Suppurative lesions become granulomatous, and histopathological examination of the granulomas shows a central necrotic, sometimes caseating zone surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and fibroblasts in a radial arrange-  2766 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

Bronchopneumonia was most pronounced in animals exposed to the smaller particles and was characterized by tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement and reddish, firm, 0.2- to 0.5cm-diameter discrete inflammatory lesions scattered throughout the lungs. In the absence of treatment, the disease progressed to pneumonic consolidation and organization, granuloma formation, and eventual chronic interstitial fibrosis. Humans with inhalational exposures also develop hemorrhagic inflammation of the airways early in the course of illness, which may progress to bronchopneumonia.54 Histopathological examination of affected lungs shows alveolar spaces filled with an exudate of mononuclear cells. Pleuritis with adhesions and effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy are common radiological and pathological findings.70,72 Clinical Manifestations  The primary clinical forms of tularemia vary in severity and presentation according to virulence of the infecting organism, dose, and site of inoculum. Primary disease presentations include ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, typhoidal, and septic forms.19,20,49,70,72,74,75 The term typhoidal tularemia has been used to describe illness in tularemia patients with systemic infections manifesting as fever and other constitutional signs without cutaneous or mucosal membrane lesions or regional lymphadenitis. Sometimes, these patients present with prominent gastrointestinal manifestations, such as diarrhea and pain. Confusion is created when typhoidal tularemia is used to describe the illness in patients infected by  inhalation, especially when there are signs of pleuropneumonic disease; this usage can be misleading and has been discouraged.54,75 The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever (38C-40C), headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. A pulsetemperature dissociation has been noted in as many as 42% of patients.49 A dry or slightly productive cough and substernal pain or tightness frequently occur with or without objective signs of pneumonia, such as purulent sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic pain, or hemoptysis.7,19,26,70,74 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea sometimes occur. Sweats, fever and chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. Studies of volunteers have shown that F tularensis aerosol exposures can incapacitate some persons in the first 1 or 2 days of illness, and significant impairment in performing tasks can continue for days after antibiotic treatment is begun.76 In untreated tularemia, symptoms often persist for several weeks and, sometimes, for months, usually with progressive debility. Any form of tularemia may be complicated by hematogenous spread, resulting in secondary pleuropneumonia, sepsis, and, rarely, meningitis.74,77 Prior to the advent of antibiotics, the overall mortality from infections with the more severe type A strains was in the range of 5% to 15%, and fatality rates as high as 30% to 60% were reported for untreated pneumonic and severe systemic forms of disease.72,78 Currently, the overall case-fatality rate of reported cases in the United States is less than 2%.34,49 Type B infections are rarely fatal. In ulceroglandular tularemia, the form that typically arises from handling a contaminated carcass or following an infective arthropod bite, a local cutaneous papule appears at the inoculation site at about the time of onset of generalized symptoms, becomes pustular, and ulcerates within a few days of its first appearance. The ulcer is ten-  Figure 1. Cervical Lymphadenitis in a Patient With Pharyngeal Tularemia  Patient has marked swelling and fluctuant suppuration of several anterior cervical nodes.

Typically, one or more regional afferent lymph nodes may become enlarged and tender within several days of the appearance of the papule. Even with antibiotic treatment, the affected nodes may become fluctuant and rupture. In oculoglandular tularemia, which follows direct contamination of the eye, ulceration occurs on the conjunctiva, accompanied by pronounced chemosis, vasculitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Glandular tularemia is characterized by lymphadenopathy without an ulcer. Oropharyngeal tularemia is acquired by drinking contaminated water, ingesting contaminated food, and, sometimes, by inhaling contaminated droplets or aerosols.14,20,36,43,50,51,79 Affected persons may develop stomatitis but more commonly develop exudative pharyngitis or tonsillitis, sometimes with ulceration. Pronounced cervical or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy may occur (FIGURE 1).74,79 Tularemia pneumonia can be the direct result of inhaling contaminated aerosols or be secondary to hematogenous spread from a distal site. An aerosol release of F tularensis would be expected to result in acute illness with signs and symptoms of 1 or more of pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, pleuropneumonitis, and hilar lymphadenitis, accompanied by various manifesta2767  2001 American Medical Association.

Clinicians Caring for Patients With Suspected Tularemia Should Immediately Contact Their: (1) Hospital epidemiologist or infection control practitioner and (2) Local or state health departments Consult your local telephone operator, the telephone directory under ""governmental listings,"" or the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov/other .htm#states or http://www.astho.org /state.html If the local and state health departments are unavailable, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at (970) 221-6400 or http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid /dvbid.htm  more lobes, and often accompanied by pleural effusions and hilar lymphadenopathy (FIGURE 2).72,75 Signs may, however, be minimal or absent, and some patients will show only 1 or several small, discrete pulmonary infiltrates or scattered granulomatous lesions of lung parenchyma or pleura. Although volunteers challenged with aerosols of virulent F tularensis (type A) regularly developed systemic symptoms of acute illness 3 to 5 days following exposure, only 25% to 50% of participants had radiological evidence of pneumonia in the early stages of infection.7,26 On the other hand, pulmonary infection can sometimes rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.72,80 Lung abscesses occur infrequently.75 Typhoidal tularemia is used to describe systemic illness in the absence of signs indicating either site of inoculation or anatomic localization of infection. This should be differentiated from inhalational tularemia with pleuropneumonic disease.54,75 Tularemia sepsis is potentially severe and fatal. As in typhoidal tularemia, nonspecific findings of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting may be prominent early in the course of illness. The patient typically appears toxic and may develop confusion and coma. Unless treated promptly, septic shock and other complications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome may ensue, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and organ failure.80 DIAGNOSIS Tularemia in humans occurs infrequently, resulting in a low index of diagnostic suspicion among clinicians and laboratorians. Since rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available, the first indication of intentional tularemia might follow recognition by public health authorities of a clustering of acute, severe respiratory illness with unusual epidemiological features (Table 1). Suspicion of tularemia might be triggered in alert clini-  tions of systemic illness. Inhalational exposures, however, commonly result in an initial clinical picture of systemic illness without prominent signs of respiratory disease.7,43,53,56 The earliest pulmonary radiographic findings of inhalational tularemia may be peribronchial infiltrates, typically advancing to bronchopneumonia in 1 o r  cians encountering patients with findings of atypical pneumonia, pleuritis, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Identification of F tularensis in clinical specimens may be missed or delayed for days or weeks when procedures for routine microbiological screening of bacterial pathogens are followed, and it is unlikely that a serendipitous laboratory identification would be the sentinel event that alerted authorities to a major bioterrorism action. Physicians who suspect inhalational tularemia should promptly collect specimens of respiratory secretions and blood and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Francisella tularensis may be identified by direct examination of secretions, exudates, or biopsy specimens using direct fluorescent antibody or immunohistochemical stains.81-83 By light microscopy, the organism is characterized by its small size (0.2 m 0.2-0.7 m), pleomorphism, and faint staining. It does not show the bipolar staining characteristics of Yersinia pestis,4 the agent of plague, and is easily distinguished from the large gram-positive rods characteristic of vegetative forms of Bacillus anthracis (FIGURE 3).2 Microscopic demonstration of F tularensis using fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public Health Laboratory Network; test results can be made available within several hours of receiving the appropriate specimens if the laboratory is alerted and prepared. Suspicion of inhalational tularemia must be promptly reported to local or state public health authorities so timely epidemiological and environmental investigations can be made (BOX). Growth of F tularensis in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia.60,81 Francisella tularensis can be grown from pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, and even fasting gastric aspirates in a high proportion of patients with inhalational tularemia.56 It is only occasionally isolated from the blood.

Selective agar (such as chocolate agar selective for Neisseria gonorrhea isolation) may be useful when culturing materials from nonsterile sites, such as sputum. Inoculated media should be incubated at 37C. Although growth may be visible as early as 24 to 48 hours after inoculation, growth may be delayed and cultures should be held for at least 10 days before discarding. Under ideal conditions, bacterial colonies on cysteineenriched agar are typically 1 mm in diameter after 24 to 48 hours of incubation and 3 to 5 mm in diameter by 96 hours.60,81 On cysteine heart agar, F tularensis colonies are characteristically opalescent and do not discolor the medium (FIGURE 4). Antigen detection assays, polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunoassays, immunoblotting, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis, and other specialized techniques may be used to identify F tularensis and to characterize strains.84-87 These procedures are usually performed only in research and reference laboratories, however. In laboratories where advanced methods are  established, results of antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction analyses can be obtained within several hours of receipt of isolates. Typically, serum antibody titers do not attain diagnostic levels until 10 or more days after onset of illness, and serology would provide minimal useful information for managing an outbreak. Serological confirmation of cases, however, may be of value for forensic or epidemiological purposes. Most laboratories use tube agglutination or microagglutination tests that detect combined immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G.84,85 A 4-fold change in titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens, a single titer of at least 1:160 for tube agglutination or 1:128 for microagglutination is diagnostic for F tularensis infection. Information on reference diagnostic testing and shipping/ handling of specimens can be obtained from state public health laboratories and from the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, CDC, Fort Collins, Colo (telephone: [970] 221-6400; e-mail: dvbid@cdc.gov). VACCINATION Beginning in the 1930s, t he Soviet Union used a live attenuated vaccine to immunize tens of millions of persons living in tularemia-endemic areas.88 In  Figure 4.

In a retrospective study of civilians working with F tularensis at a US Army research facility, the incidence of accidental acute inhalational tularemia among laboratorians declined from 5.70 cases per 1000 person-years of risk at 2769  2001 American Medical Association.

In volunteer studies, the live attenuated vaccine did not protect all recipients against aerosol challenges with virulent F tularensis.7,26 Correlates of protective immunity appear about 2 weeks following natural infection or vaccination. Given the short incubation period of tularemia and incomplete protection of current vaccines against inhalational tularemia, vaccination is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis. The working group recommends use of the live vaccine strain only for laboratory personnel routinely working with F tularensis. TREATMENT Contained Casualty Situation  Table 3. Working Group Consensus Recommendations for Treatment of Patients With Tularemia in a Mass Casualty Setting and for Postexposure Prophylaxis* Mass Casualty Recommended Therapy Adults Preferred choices Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Children Preferred choices Doxycycline; if 45 kg, give 100 mg orally twice daily; if 45 kg, give 2.2 mg/kg orally twice daily Ciprofloxacin, 15 mg/kg orally twice daily Pregnant Women Preferred choices Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice daily Doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily *One antibiotic, appropriate for patient age, should be chosen from among alternatives. The duration of all recommended therapies in Table 3 is 14 days. Not a US Food and Drug Administrationapproved use. Ciprofloxacin dosage should not exceed 1 g/d in children.  Adults. In a contained casualty situation, in which logistics permit individual medical management, the working group recommends parenteral antimicrobial therapy for tularemia (TABLE 2). Streptomycin is the drug of choice.49,74,90,91 Gentamicin, which is more widely available and may be used intravenously, is an acceptable alternative. 49,74,90-93 Treatment with aminoglycosides should be continued for 10 days. Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are also used to treat tularemia49,74,90; however, relapses and primary treatment failures occur at a higher rate with these bacteriostatic agents than with aminoglycosides, and they should be given for at least 14 days to reduce chance of relapse.27,74,90 Fluoroquinolones, which have intracellular activity, are promising candidates for treating tularemia. Ciprofloxacin, which is not labeled for use in tularemia, has been shown to be active against F tularensis in vitro94 and in animals95 and has been used to successfully treat tularemia in both adults and chil-  dren.90,94,96,97 Treatment with ciprofloxacin should be continued for 10 days. In persons beginning treatment with parenteral doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol, therapy can be switched to oral antibiotic administration when clinically indicated. Very limited experiences in treating tularemia patients with -lactam and macrolide antibiotics have been reported, and treatment failures have occurred.98 Use of -lactam and macrolide antibiotics in treating tularemia is neither FDA-approved nor recommended by the working group. Children. In children, streptomycin or gentamicin is recommended by the working group as first-line treatment in a contained casualty situation (Table 2). Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin ( 1 g/d), and chloramphenicol can be used as alternatives to aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones have been reported to cause cartilage damage in immature animals and are not FDA-approved for use in children. However, short courses of these agents have not been associated with arthropathy in pediatric patients, and the potential risks of their use must be weighed against their benefits in treating serious infections.96,99,100 Mass Casualty Situation  Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, administered orally, are the preferred choices for treatment in the mass casualty setting, for both adults and children (TABLE 3). The ciprofloxacin dosage for children should not exceed 1 g/d. In a mass casualty situation, the working group believes the benefits to children from short courses of doxycycline or fluoroquinolones (Table 3) outweigh the risks of their use. Since it is unknown whether drugresistant organisms might be used in a bioterrorist event, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates should be conducted quickly and treatments altered according to test results and clinical responses. Antibiotics for treating patients infected with tularemia in a bioterrorism scenario are included in a national pharmaceutical stockpile  2770 JAMA, June 6, 2001--Vol 285, No. 21 (Reprinted)  2001 American Medical Association.

In a contained casualty situation, short courses of gentamicin are likely to pose a low risk to fetuses when used to treat tularemia in pregnant women (Table 2). Rare cases of fetal nerve deafness and renal damage have been reported with other aminoglycosides but have not been reported with gentamicin. The benefits of gentamicin in treating pregnant women with tularemia are expected to outweigh any potential risk to fetuses. In a mass casualty situation, oral ciprofloxacin is considered the best alternative to gentamicin for pregnant women (Table 3). Immunosuppressed Persons. There is scant experience in treating tularemia in immunocompromised patients. However, considering the greater occurrence in immunocompetent patients of tularemia relapses and treatment failures following use of bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents compared with aminoglycosides, streptomycin or gentamicin should be used when possible to treat patients with known immune dysfunction in either contained casualty or mass casualty situations (Table 2). POSTEXPOSURE ANTIBIOTIC RECOMMENDATIONS Persons beginning treatment with streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin in the incubation period of tularemia and continuing treatment daily for 14 days might be protected against symptomatic infection. In studies of aerosol challenge with infective doses of the virulent SCHU S-4 strain of F tularensis, each of 8 volunteers given oral dosages of tetracycline, 1 g/d for 28 days, and each of 8 volunteers given tetracycline, 2 g/d for 14 days, were fully protected when treatment was begun 24 hours following challenge.27 Two of 10 volunteers given tetracycline, 1 g/d for only 5 days,  developed symptomatic tularemia after antibiotic treatment was stopped. In the unlikely event that authorities quickly become aware that an F tularensis biological weapon has been used and are able to identify and reach exposed persons during the early incubation period, the working group recommends that exposed persons be prophylactically treated with 14 days of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin (Table 3). In a circumstance in which the weapon attack has been covert and the event is discovered only after persons start to become ill, persons potentially exposed should be instructed to begin a fever watch. Persons who develop an otherwise unexplained fever or flulike illness within 14 days of presumed exposure should begin treatment as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. In the laboratory, persons who have had potentially infective exposures to F tularensis should be administered oral postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis if the risk of infection is high (eg, spill, centrifuge accident, or needlestick). If the risk is low, exposed persons can be placed on a fever watch and treated if they develop symptoms. Postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment of close contacts of tularemia patients is not recommended since human-to-human transmission of F tularensis is not known to occur. INFECTION CONTROL Isolation is not recommended for tularemia patients, given the lack of human-to-human transmission. In hospitals, standard precautions 101 are recommended by the working group for treatment of patients with tularemia. Microbiology laboratory personnel should be alerted when tularemia is clinically suspected. Routine diagnostic procedures can be performed in biological safety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Examination of cultures in which F tularensis is suspected should be carried out in a biological safety cabinet. Manipulation of cultures and other activities involving infectious materials with a potential for aerosol or droplet production (centrifuging, grinding, vig-  orous shaking, growing cultures in volume, animal studies) require BSL-3 conditions.102 When F tularensis is presumptively identified in a routine BSL-2 clinical laboratory (level A), specimens should be forwarded to a BSL-3 laboratory (level B) (eg, a state public health laboratory) for confirmation of agent and other studies, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing.11 Bodies of patients who die of tularemia should be handled using standard precautions. Autopsy procedures likely to cause aerosols, such as bone sawing, should be avoided. Clothing or linens contaminated with body fluids of patients infected with F tularensis should be disinfected per standard precautions protocols.101 ENVIRONMENTAL DECONTAMINATION AND PROTECTION Under natural conditions, F tularensis may survive for extended periods in a cold, moist environment. The working group lacks information on survival of intentionally dispersed particles but would expect a short halflife due to desiccation, solar radiation, oxidation and other environmental factors, and a very limited risk from secondary dispersal. In circumstances of a laboratory spill or intentional use in which authorities are concerned about an environmental risk (eg, inanimate surfaces wet with material thought to contain F tularensis), decontamination can be achieved by spraying the suspected contaminant with a 10% bleach solution (1 part household bleach and 9 parts water). After 10 minutes, a 70% solution of alcohol can be used to further clean the area and reduce the corrosive action of the bleach. Soap water can be used to flush away less hazardous contaminations. Persons with direct exposure to powder or liquid aerosols containing F tularensis should wash body surfaces and clothing with soap water. Standard levels of chlorine in municipal water sources should protect against waterborne infection.60 Following an urban release, the risk to humans of acquiring tula2771  2001 American Medical Association.

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH Simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests that could be used to identify persons infected with F tularensis in the mass exposure setting need to be developed. Further methods should be designed to rapidly define the molecular genetic characteristics of organisms, especially as they may relate to engineered attributes, such as enhanced virulence and resistance to antimicrobial agents or normally lethal environmental conditions. Complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of natural strains of F tularensis would provide an archival base for understanding genetic variants, functions of genes, and mechanisms of action useful in developing means to protect against F tularensis. Research is also needed to develop accurate and reliable procedures to rapidly detect F tularensis in environmental samples. New technologies should be explored for developing active (eg, DNAbased) or passive (eg, monoclonal antibodybased) vaccines for rapid preexposure or postexposure protection.

Zerhouni, M.D.                  Director,                  National Institutes of Health                 Part II:  Mark B. McClellan, M.D.                  Commissioner                  Food & Drug Administration                                                CHAIRMAN KASS:   I think we should get started, notwithstanding                the fact that a few of our members are delinquent.  We'll just                keep them after school.                 This session is entitled ""Stem Cells — Moving Research from                the Bench Toward the Bedside:  The Role of the NIH,"" and then                in the second of this session, the FDA.                 This afternoon we move from the principles of the stem cell policy                to its implementation with a review of the contributions of NIH                and the FDA to efforts aimed at bringing research from the bench                toward the bedside.                  Administering government funding of stem cell research is largely                the task of the National Institutes of Health where, as we heard                from Dr. Baldwin over a year ago, vigorous efforts have been made                from the very beginning to make cell lines available to characterize                their properties to support research, training, and infrastructure.                              Today we are very pleased, and greatly honored, to have with us                the Director of the NIH, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, who has kindly agreed                to give us a progress report on the developing field of stem cell                research as it looks from the strategic center of federal support                and direction.                 Dr. Zerhouni will make a presentation after which we will have                discussion.  He has to leave sharply at 3:00.                 Dr. Zerhouni, we are in your debt for taking the time to give                us the benefit of your observations and insights.  Thank you very                much.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Thank you, Dr. Kass, and members of the                Council.  It's a pleasure for me to be here and to share with                you what NIH is doing in promoting the field of embryonic stem cell                research in particular, and stem cell research in general.                 What I'd like to do is really give you an overview of what                has happened since the implementation of President Bush's policy                on August 9, 2001, at NIH, how NIH is tackling the field of stem                cell research, what we are seeing as the major priorities and challenges                that we need to overcome as we speak.                 I will not spend too much time on the promise of stem cell research.                 I think this Council knows all of the implications of cultured pluripotent                stem cells and the challenges that are needed — that need to be                met to transform these cells in differentiated elements that can                serve in overcoming loss of function and help regenerating lost                function.                 You know also the hierarchy of stem cells that go from totipotent                to pluripotent to multipotent stem cells.  To this point, we've                never demonstrated a return from a pluripotent to a totipotent stem                cell, but there is one paper that indicates that that may be happening                in mouse stem cells.  And we will talk about that a little bit;                we'll touch upon it.                 But clearly, there are two known ways currently to make pluripotent                stem cells.  One is obviously using the inner cell mass, and one                is using germ cells.  This method was promoted by Dr. Gearhart at                Johns Hopkins and Dr. Jamie Thomson at Wisconsin.                 So when you then ask yourself, what is so unique about human embryonic                stem cells, clearly two properties come to mind — the fact that                they have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal and culture, and                that potentially they can differentiate into any adult cell type                under the right conditions.                 From the standpoint of NIH, as in any field of research that begins                to be funded at the federal level, there is an approach that needs                to be followed in the sense that research is done by people with                resources, with strategies.                  And in the area of stem cell research, as soon as I became director,                I convened groups of scientists at NIH, and we tried to define what                the milestones should be and what the pathways should be for this                area of research to grow as rapidly as possible to fulfill its promise.                              And when we look at that, there are several phases that need to                be understood, and this is the underlying strategy that supports                our activities at this point.  One, clearly, is you need to build                scientific capacity.  Remember that prior to the President's                decision there was no federal funding for this kind of research,                and, therefore, the scientific capacity in the country was likely                to be underdeveloped.  So the number one priority was to create                career development pathways, training courses, and, more importantly,                establish the infrastructure needed to do the research.                 Then, when you look at the field itself, there is a need to prove                the long-term stability of the cells, characterize them very fully                at the molecular level, and understand both theirgenetic stability                and their stability in the host, understanding the differentiation,                the growth factors, the gene regulation — all of the events that                control that specialization.                 End cell cycle control — obviously, these cells are pluripotent,                and one of the safety fears that everyone has is that they would                divide uncontrollably in the host.  So we need to understand that                mechanism.  And, obviously, since we're talking about regaining                lost function in a host, we need to understand cell host interactions.                              To do so, one of the first actions that I took as NIH Director                was to create a stem cell task force at NIH.  Prior to my arrival,                I think NIH had put together the beginnings of an implementation                policy.                  But I thought that given the challenge and given the wide-ranging                spectrum of activities that the agency needed to get into, I thought                it was very important to elevate this activity at the level of the                director and to have a specific task force, including both intramural                and extramural researchers, to look at what were the most important                roadblocks to overcome, the most important avenues of research to                stimulate quickly, and where was the — where were the pressure points,                if you will, where we needed to intervene to accelerate the field.                              Well, obviously, the task force divided itself into working groups,                as you can see.  And, no surprise, career pathways, resources, the                peer review, since obviously NIH is based on peer review and we                needed to have a cadre of competent reviewers.  And in a new field                it's always a challenge.  Tools and technologies, and obviously                the ability for us to reach out to the research community throughout                the country.                 This stem cell task force has members who are both active in the                field or have knowledge in the field of developmental biology and                cell cultures and other fields and are advising the director through                the task force, which is chaired by Dr. Jim Battey.                 As we looked at the challenges, it was quite obvious that the                immediate challenge for NIH and the human ES cell research community                was first to generate and characterize the distribution quality                human ES cell lines from the NIH.                  It's very important to understand what ""distribution                quality"" means.  It is not — a cell line being available is                not enough.  A cell line having been derived is not enough.  It                needs to be characterized, it needs to be quality controlled, it                needs to be expended, and it needs to be immediately available to                the research laboratories that need it.                 The second was the need to stimulate more research on basic biology,                and the third was the training of investigators.                 In the basic tools of the field, first and foremost, before the                use of stem cells and the approach of hypothesis-driven research,                we needed to have a cadre of confident and competent investigators                in the field.  So those were the action lines that started pretty                much last year, a little bit over a year ago.                 Now, when you look at the issue of lines, I know that the public                always tries to understand why is it that the President's policy                talks of 78 lines, and we talk about 12 lines that are available.                 And there is always a little bit of confusion, so let me, if you                don't mind, give you the steps that are needed to go from a                derivation to a fully available line.  And I think that semantics                sometimes get in the way.                 But fundamentally, as you know, derivations occur when you are                collecting the inner cell line — cell mass, and you're developing                your primary colonies.  And then, through subcultures, about 1,000                cells per well, you then expend these cell lines with about a 10                percent survival rate.                 So as we know today, these cell cultures are not as efficient                or effective as we would like them to be.  Then, you have to basically                then multiply these lines through multiple passages.                 Well, obviously, because these cells have the potential differentiation,                you need — at each passage you need to characterize through molecular                marker studies and assure yourself that these have remained stem                cell lines.  So one flask grows up to 100,000 cells, and one bank                that would be capable of fulfilling distribution needs requires                at least two billion cells.  That takes about nine months to a year.                              So, and when you distribute these cells, depending on the distributor,                there are about two million cells needed per vial, and that means                ready for distribution.                  So when people look at this, they forget that on August 9, 2001,                there were 64, 78 lines, whatever the number of qualified lines                was at the exact time.  We end up qualifying 78 sources, but to                make those sources expended and characterized to the point where                you need — you have lines available — takes about 12 months.                              So when you look at the schedule, what we have accomplished is                about — last year there was one line that was widely available,                and today there are 12.  And that's the reason between the 78                versus 12 numbers that you hear around.                  There are other lines that are being expended as we speak.  There                are agreements that are being signed.  One has to remember that                these lines do not belong to the Federal Government; they belong                to their own derivers, and, therefore, are subject to intellectual                property agreements, which sometimes are easy to negotiate and sometimes                are not so easy to negotiate.                 But I think our role was to increase as quickly as possible the                number of widely available lines that the researchers could have                access to to do the research.  So the way we did this was by rapidly                awarding to organizations with entries on the NIH-eligible cell                line registry, funds to develop those lines into distribution quality                cell lines, and that's the difference between eligible and distribution                quality.                 We gave them a two-year period of support.  We granted eight awards                for a total of over $6 million, and we have about 12 lines now ready                for shipment, meaning in my criterion for that, which I insisted                be the criterion which is listed on the website, is you can pick                up the phone and get the line delivered to you within a measurable                matter of days.                 So the program announcement will be reissued, because we have                now other sources of lines that are interested as they have learned                more about the expendability of the lines, interested in making                their lines commercially available.                 In addition to that, I think there are many sources of lines that                have reserved derivations for further expansion as we learn more                in the research.  So those are the infrastructure awards that accomplish                that.                 Then, NIH has two means, really, of supporting research.  One                is obviously training; the second is to fund investigator-initiated                research, which can be either spontaneously generated or can be                stimulated by NIH.                  And the way NIH stimulates research is by issuing program announcements                or requests for applications around areas of research that are either                aligned with the mission of the Institute that issues these RFAs                and PAs, or are general announcements that the entire NIH wants                to support.                 So one of the program announcements we made was to have grantees                develop short-term courses in human embryonic stem cell culture                techniques.  We use the T15 mechanism, and it's supported by                11 NIH institutes.                  And basically, we have been able to award four of these.  These                are courses that can take up to two or three weeks at certain centers,                and investigators can send their own core investigators or personnel                to these centers.  And these have been extremely well received by                the research community.                 We have also career development awards, career enhancement awards                for stem cell research specifically issued by several institutions,                which allow an investigator to spend up to 24 months with $50,000                of direct cost exploring the field of embryonic stem cell research                as well as have training in the uses of stem cells.                 And then, requests for applications are directed towards areas                of scientific priorities that the NIH feels need to be stimulated.                 So we have stimulated multi-investigator teams.  We have infrastructure,                growth and maintenance, research into biochemical/molecular markers,                and so on.                 And we are trying now to establish exploratory center grants that                will lead to, then, formal centers that will have for a primary                mission the development of the applications and the basic science                of human embryonic stem cells.                 Then, obviously, as you can imagine, there is a tremendous amount                of interest in rapid application in particular disease areas.  So                institutes now have also issued very specific RFAs in avenues of                research that are deemed to be potentially fruitful in the short                term.                  So innovative concepts and approaches to developing functional                tissues and organs from NHLBI, plasticity of human stem cells in                the nervous system, and you can obviously imagine what these applications                area — recovery of cardiac function, the recovery of neural function,                recovery of endocrine function in the case of diabetes, and obviously                basic and applied stem cell for arthritis and musculoskeletal disease.                              The Institute feels that this is a high priority area, given the                fact that musculoskeletal disease and arthritis is emerging as the                number one cause of disability in an aging population.  And then,                development and repair of orofacial structures.                 I will just go quickly now in terms of some of the more fundamental                research — for example, NIDDK is promoting comprehensive programs                in beta cell biology, again a diabetic target.  And then, obviously                looking at the genome anatomy of the hematopoietic stem cells, given                the genomic techniques that are available to us, and so on.  So                I don't want to take too much of your time on details, but this                is the strategy that we have implemented.                 In addition, we have also stimulated intramural research.  When                this field started, you could basically identify one or two labs                at NIH intramural that had an interest and lead in embryonic stem                cell research.  Dr. Ron McKay, through mouse embryonic stem cells,                was probably the most prominent.                 Today we have nine laboratories in NIH working aggressively and                publishing in these areas.  We have a much expanded interest as                cell line availability becomes more straightforward.  So we knew                that that was a roadblock that needed to be overcome before anything                else could happen, and that's what we worked on.                 In addition, through the identification of roadblocks by the stem                cell task force, one of the things that became very obvious for                us, for all of us in the field, was that unless we had a formal                way of characterizing and identifying the characteristics of each                cell line, it would be very difficult to compare experiments from                lab A to lab B to lab C.                 And when we surveyed the field and we surveyed the level of knowledge                needed for characterization cell markers, molecular characteristics,                and so on, we realized that there wasn't a worldwide agreement,                nor was there a U.S. consensus about how to really make sure that                you're dealing with a stem cell, and how do you know that over                a period of time, and how do you compare line A versus line B.                 So we decided to establish an intramural research program dedicated                to the characterization of stem cell lines.  We think that this                is an important investment, because it will give us for the first                time the ability to call a stem cell a stem cell in the real scientific                sense of the way — of the word.                 So, in summary, what I think you can see between 2002 and 2003                is that we have built the infrastructure, we have accepted investigator-initiated                awards, we had 21 applications in '02.  Now remember, in NIH                parlance FY2002 goes from October 1, 2001, which was a month after                the announcement of the policy to September 30, 2002, and 27 applications                in '03.                 We have awarded 25.  We have also awarded 66 administrative supplements.                 These are scientists who have already accumulated the knowledge                base to work with stem cells, either in adult stem cells or mouse                embryonic stem cells, and we issued a rapid series of supplemental                grants to allow them to work with human embryonic stem cells.                 So we have 66 additional grantees, or groups anyway, that are                able to use human stem cells.                 We also had a research symposium in June that showcased both the                research conducted and supported by NIH, but integrated this with                the GM cell symposium that occurred here in Washington on June 10th                and 11th, to look at the entire field and try to understand where                the field was at the time.                 On the research horizon, I think what came out of those meetings                is that the priorities today are the following.  One is to define,                standardize, human ES cell culture conditions that obviate the need                for either mouse or human feeder cells.  This is a priority.  We                already have grants from investigators that have been funded.                  We have several reports from groups that have been funded by NIH                looking at the characteristics of, what is it that gives a mouse                feeder cell the ability to grow human embryonic stem cells?  What's                so special about that versus human feeder cells versus feeder-free                cells?                  And there have been recent papers that indicate that you could                — once you understand the molecular drivers of that growth, you                can probably foresee the ability for us to develop, soon I hope,                culture conditions that will obviate the need for any feeder cells.                              Then, the second is you can hear many — you can hear through the                scientific community those enabling tools and technologies to further                characterize stem cells as they become specialized cells are needed.                 And that goes from specialized antibodies to identify very specific                markers of multiple different lineages.                  But it's also a — there is also a requirement from the scientific                community to understand what the genetic events — what the gene                expression patterns are between a multipotent stem cell and the                one that becomes, let's say, a muscle cell or a blood cell.                               And that is an area of very, very important research that is ongoing,                and there have been several papers published trying to identify                which genes are really turned on or off as you go from the stem                state to a non-stem state.  And that essentially defines the point                number three, which is understanding the molecular pathways that                specify differentiation into these different specialized cells.                              And then, obviously, we're not talking about cells just in                culture.  They have to survive and function within the host, so                that many, many researchers are now focusing their attention on                the critical factors and conditions that drive the long-term survival                of these cells in the host.                 And then, obviously, the one question that requires resolution                before any human clinical trials are even envisioned is the assurance                that we need — and I lwill let my colleague Dr. Mark McClellan talk                about it — to make sure that we can control cell division and prevent                the development of a malignancy or untoward complication.                 Now, as we speak about this, you will hear that human feeder layers                are a very important step, and the research already alluded to this.                 And the point here is that until recently all human embryonic stem                cells were grown on mouse feeder layers.  And new conditions are                being established using human feeder layers.                  We know from the Johns Hopkins group there was a recent paper                from the Technion Institute in Israel about developing matrix-like                substances that grow — that can grow without human feeder cells,                these human embryonic stem cells.                 There was a publication — not a publication, but at least an announcement                from the Singapore company that you could do that.  There are at                least unpublished reports of multiple groups having worked and working                on developing these lines.                 Now, this is presented often as a sine qua non of further research.                 I'm sure that Dr. McClellan will address the issue of how you                go about qualifying any cell lines that are grown or not grown on                animal or human feeder cells.                 Now, but that is still in our mind an issue that requires work,                requires development.  It will be much more desirable for us to                have understood the culture conditions without having the variability                associated with either mouse or human feeder cells, even though                that — from the conclusions from FDA and many others — indicate                that it is not a complete obstacle to clinical trials.                  But in my mind, it's much more desirable not to have that                factor come into play at all if we can avoid it.  But it seems to                be doable, and the research is ongoing.                 Now, just quickly some important research results.  The group                at the University of Wisconsin has been able to report on homologous                recombination in stem cells.  For those of you who are not familiar                with that, it's the ability to essentially introduce genetic                material that will modify the genetic makeup of the cell, and so                that you can control — experimentally anyway — some of the characteristics                of these cells.  That is an important step, we think, in the field.                              In terms of application, you have heard about the work from Dr.                Ron McKay primarily, showing a method that can drive the differentiation                towards dopamine-secreting neurons using these in an animal model                and demonstrating, in fact, recovery of function in a model of Parkinson's                disease — very, very promising avenues of research here.                 Then, one of the key areas of research, as I indicated before,                was to identify the key genes, the master genes that control the                state of stemness that we need to understand in terms of being able                to maintain cell cultures in the state that we wish them to be in                over the long- term.  And this is a very important advance in the                sense that we are identifying now new genes.                  One is nanog — after the mythological Celtic land of eternal youth                — which basically maintains the self-renewing properties of mouse                embryonic stem cells, and he has expressed these as inner cell mass.                              You couple that with other research ongoing in human embryonic                stem cells — Dr. Rowe at the NIH, Dr. Goldman, I think, is doing                similar research — where gene array studies of these cells are coding                down on a subset of genes which seem to be essential to the stemness                state.                  So we are very hopeful that within a short period of time we will                be able to at least identify some of the key master genes that are                really at play in this type of cells.                 Then, you see advances in terms of not just looking at the stem                cell state, but looking at a differentiated state and understanding                the pathway going from stem to a specific type of cell, with multiple                papers indicating recipes at this point.  They are not well understood.                               But clearly, researchers are able to show that through multiple                approaches they can lead a cell to become, for example, a myocyte                that beats, just like a cardiac cell would, an endothelial cell                or a neuron with very specific functional measurements.  This is                the most exciting part, if you will, of the research, because it                indicates that there is really proof of concept occurring in multiple                subsystems from the same kind of cells that are being worked on.                              Duke University found that you can, in fact, grow a progenitor                — from progenitor cells myocytes.  The group in Israel also has                shown that they can differentiate human embryonic stem cells into                beating myocytes.  Clearly, both in adult stem cells and human embryonic                stem cells you see early results that seem to indicate that cardiac                function recovery can happen with stem cell therapeutic approaches.                 That's very interesting.                 Obviously, NIH supports research on many types of stem cells.                 I'm focusing my comments on human embryonic stem cells, obviously.                  But as you know, adult stem cells have been funded for many, many                years, particularly in the field of cancer and hematology malignancies.                               Just to give you a sense of the relationship, in FY2002, our investment                in human adult stem cell was over $170 million.  In FY2002, which                is the very first year of stem cell research on embryonic human                stem cells, our total investment was about $10 million.  This year's                investment is probably going to be $17-, $18-, $20 million in the                human embryonic stem cell research, and will be about the same number,                maybe $180 million, in adult stem cell research.                 This is not counting animal stem cell research on mouse embryonic                stem cells or other types of stem cells.  So as you can see, the                investment is growing.  But, again, we hope for advances in all                fields of stem cell research.                  We think that given the very early nature of our knowledge, our                understanding, and the limited nature of our understanding, it is                important to promote both areas of research, we think, at this point                as aggressively as we can.                  You know about the multipotent adult progenitor cells that Dr.                Verfaillie has developed.  It shows capabilities for self-renewal                and differentiation to many specialized cells.  I don't want                to take too much time, but we can see glial stem cells that can                produce neurons in culture — very interesting paper from Nunez.                              And satellite cells in muscle that have been identified as adult                stem cells that can divide in response to injury.  And, clearly,                some early results that indicate that we can turn on these cells,                particularly in patients with muscle-wasting diseases.                 At NIH recently there were stem cells identified in baby teeth                that have also quite a bit of potential.  So, clearly, a lot of                things are happening.  You can see also bone marrow stem cells that                are redifferentiated towards neural stem cells.                 There are a lot of questions on the mechanisms by which these                occur.  Some people feel that fusion might be the reason, rather                than just the stem redirection.  So we'll see about that as                we go forward.                 And we're providing also a large amount of information to                the research community on our websites.                 I have material here that I could give you also — I don't                know if I'm okay on time — comments about the stem cell sources                and what is really happening in terms of stem cell sources in the                world right now, to just give the Council an idea of how these things                really develop and what happens in terms of research groups using                them.                 So this is the paper that I wanted to mention.   By the way, before                I go into that area, there's a paper from Hubner in  Science                 using mouse embryonic stem cells.  They were able to generate what                appeared to be oocyte-like cells in vitro.                  This is the very first paper on an animal system that seemed to                indicate that you can revert from the pluripotent state to the totipotent                state.  It is not confirmed at this point.  We don't really                know that the — what they look at and define as structures resembling                blastocysts in the petri dish are really blastocysts, whether they                have the potential or not.                 If these experiments can be repeated in human embryonic stem cells,                there will be important implications for the creation of new cell                lines, generation of tissue, and so on.  So this is a paper that                I think the Council should pay attention to, because it is quite                surprising actually to see these events in these oocyte-like — in                these culture conditions.                 So in terms of cell sources, the first one that was available                was the H1 line from Wisconsin.  It has about 300 vials in inventory.                 It has shipped already about 105 orders.  About 78 of these were                in U.S. institutions, and the rest was overseas.                  And then, the cell characteristics are quite well defined, and                these cells seem to — these are the most healthy it looks like,                from the point of view of passages.  These cells are in passage                22 and are available immediately.  So this is a very healthy colony                that seems to grow to the right number with a limited number of                passages.                 H7 is another line.  They have just made this one available.                 Obviously, it's now commercially available, has slightly different                characteristics.  And H9 has — there are about 10 orders that have                been fulfilled with H9.  These have all been made available in the                past four or five months, so it's not ? and, again, 10 orders                have been filled in.                 The major other source is BresaGen from Athens, Georgia.  It has                two lines available.  These lines also have interesting characteristics.                 You can see they have shipped eight total lines — five in the U.S.,                one to the U.K., Israel, and Australia.                 In the world of research in stem cells, the countries that were                just mentioned seem to be the most active, because there is a heterogeneity                in the policies of the different countries as you well know.                 From ES Cell International, there are five lines available, and                there were about 33 international shipments and 16 U.S. shipments                from this Australian source.  We have a source in Korea.  It has                one line.  There were 20 shipments made, 17 to Korea, and three                to the U.S., all of which were sent to the NIH for the purpose of                that — of characterization of the lines.                 UCSF has now one line commercially available and has 60 vials                in inventory, has shipped 19 — 15 to the U.S. and four to foreign                sources.  And I guess those are the reports I wanted to give you.                              And I'd be happy to take questions, Dr. Kass.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very, very much, for a thorough,                illuminating presentation.                  Let me remind the Council that Dr. Zerhouni has a 3:00 departure.                 Let's try to keep the questions brief, and no speeches.  The                floor is open.  Janet Rowley.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Well, I certainly speak, I'm sure, for                the rest of the Council.  We very much appreciate your taking the                time to come and update us on the current status, and certainly                the plans — the present implementation and the plans for the future                I think are ones that many of us would applaud.                 I have a series of questions.  One of the first is for the cell                lines not established on feeder layers, this implies that there                will be new ES cell lines developed.  And so the question is, these                would then not fall within President Bush's August 9th cutoff                date.  And I guess, is that really so?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   No.  Actually, we did an inventory just                prior to a hearing to just make sure that we had all our facts together.                 There were several sources — in other words, institutions or companies                — that had derived cell lines already by August 9th.  They have                not exposed all of their lines to human — to mouse feeder cell lines.                               And, in particular, we have specific information on the lines                in Sweden — Gutenberg and the Karolinska — whereby the — as you                saw in the process, there is a process of — where between derivation                and exposure to mouse feeder cell lines you can freeze the lines                and keep them.                 So there are at least those, which is about 16 lines, I believe,                that have not been exposed to either mouse or human cell — human                feeder cell lines.                  And the reason given to us by the investigator is very simple.                 They thought that the field was not mature enough, and the understanding                of the culture conditions was not there.  So I think what they're                doing is they are basically doing experiments on non-approved U.S.                cell lines, non-approved by — for federal funding, and they have                reported, for example, experiments where they are trying to use                methods that will require neither human or mouse feeder cell lines.                              And they stated very clearly that once they master those techniques,                they will then apply them to the federally fundable cell lines.                               DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.  The next question is:  what kind of                restrictions on intellectual property are attached to the lines?                 For example, those from the University of Wisconsin, because I understood                that there were certain very important restrictions.  And I know                also that NIH was trying to get some of those modified, and I wondered                what the current status was.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Right.  Basically, the restrictions are,                one, the recipients cannot implant the provider cells in the uterus,                mix the cells with an intact embryo, or attempt to make a whole                embryo.  The recipients and recipient institutions are free to publish                their research results as they wish.  The providers retain ownership                of the original material.  So WiCell retains ownership of the original                materials and any unmodified derivatives.                 However, the recipient institutions own any new materials and                inventions its researchers create.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Okay.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Those are the agreements that NIH negotiated                with WiCell, and made those agreements transferrable to NIH-funded                investigators.                 The provider of the cells can request a sample of any new materials                for internal research users.  So WiCell could request samples from                the university to develop something new for their own research,                and is free to use that for its own internal programs — any newly                patented invention.  So WiCell essentially is saying that if somebody                discovers something, they can use that for their own needs internally.                              Other restrictions — basically, the main restriction is that WiCell,                for example, granted any PHS-funded nonprofit investigators the                right to use its patented technology, and granted a royalty-free                non-commercial research license to PHS-funded researchers as long                — and this is the real important statement — as long as the agreements                with such third parties were no more onerous than those in the WiCell                agreement.                 And WiCell specifically excludes sponsored research where the                research sponsor gives commercial rights to a third party.  In other                words, let's say, you know, Dr. Foster receives cells at UT                Southwestern, and then using those cells and whatever discovery                he or she makes, goes to a third party and conveys commercial rights                without WiCell being — having its right respected.                 So those are the interesting issues I think that govern that.                               DR. ROWLEY:   Can I ask you just one more question, which                there is — in Britain, the MRC is trying to develop a cell bank,                and I just — presumably, it would be parallel with the cell bank                that's being developed at NIH.  And is there any collaboration                or coordination of efforts?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Okay.  Let's be careful.  NIH is not                developing a cell bank.  It's developing a cell characterization                unit.  In other words, we will develop the reagents, we will have                the lines that we will compare, and we will do a full catalog of                all of the characteristics that researchers tell us are very important.                 Make the reagents available, make the antibodies available.  We're                not going to be distributors of cell lines as we speak.                 The British model is a little different.  They have a commission,                obviously, that approves or disapproves requests, and all lines                developed under that policy have to be deposited in the cell bank.                              To my knowledge, to this — I think last week there was an announcement                that the first line had been successfully derived.  And, therefore,                those derivers have the obligation to deposit that in the British                bank for wider distribution.  So they're assuming, if you will,                the infrastructure role that we granted to the sources here, they're                assuming it within the cell bank.                 Any collaborations we communicate constantly.  The most important                areas of collaboration, from my standpoint, are we need to understand                the characteristics of cell lines.  We need to exchange information.                 We need to have a more formal way of understanding what the field                is doing worldwide.  And those are the things that we're doing                with the MRC and others.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael Gazzaniga.                  DR. GAZZANIGA:   I just think it's important to get                the scale down here.  So in terms of current embryonic stem cell                research, the investment at NIH is .1 percent of your budget.  It's                extremely small.  Would you — what would be your guess that — should                more cell lines be made available through a change in the current                policy?  How fast do you think that would scale up to be more in                line with adult stem cell vessels?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I don't think the limiting factor is                the cell lines.  I really don't.  I really think the limiting                factor is human capital and trained human capital that can quickly                evaluate a wide range of research avenues in stem cells.                 So I am not of the opinion that the number of stem cells — you                can see the shipments, how many have been requested, and there are                many more available.  So I think it's more important to stimulate                the field at the human capital level in my mind, and it will take                — as you know, it takes time.  You have to have fellowships.  You                have to have centers.                  You have to have young post-docs that really get involved in the                field and have new publications and ideas and grants of their own                for that to grow.  It's not something you can, you know, drive                top-down, I don't think.                  DR. ROWLEY:   And just in that vein, your slides showed                that there were three post-doctoral fellowships awarded in FY02,                and out of four applicants.  So this highlights, I think, the problem                of human capital.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I think you're right.  But we see a                lot of is in the applications that are granted, R01 types or program,                what you see is that post-docs tend to be funded through those grants                directly, without going through a fellowship route.  But I think                you're making a good point, and we want to stimulate that.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Bill Hurlbut.                  DR. HURLBUT:   I want to clarify something.  The 16 cell                lines — I think that's what you said that were not grown on                mouse feeder cells — are those part of the original 70 designations?                               DR. ZERHOUNI:   That's correct.  I don't know if                it's 16 or 12.  I mean, I can give you the exact information,                but it's about that number.                  DR. HURLBUT:   These were essentially disaggregated and                then frozen.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Right.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Doesn't it stand to reason that given                the months preceding this policy there might be thousands of such                disaggregated embryos out there?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Do you mean between August — prior to August                1 — August 2001?                  DR. HURLBUT:   Everybody saw it coming, right?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I'm sorry?                  DR. HURLBUT:   Everybody saw it coming, that there might                be such a policy that would say, ""No further derivations.""                 Isn't it possible that there are quite a few cell lines out                there?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I wasn't at NIH at the time.  But I                can tell you that the NIH staff that worked on that truly canvassed                the world and made sure that whatever lines there was documentation,                there was informed consent, there are some — so it may be that there                are lines out there that have been derived before August 9th, but                they may not fit all of the other characteristics — informed consent,                no inducement, and so on.                 I don't know the answer to your question, but I don't                think there are thousands out there that were waiting for the policy                to come out.                  DR. HURLBUT:   I shouldn't have said thousands.  It                was a hyperbole.                 But let me ask you two other specific questions.  As you characterize                these cells and understand the molecular signals, and so forth,                obviously the hope is that you can derive them without creating                embryos somehow back — pull them down or something.  Is there any                special program that NIH is looking at in an effort to bypass the                moral problem?  And would it be reasonable to fund such a specialized                effort?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I thought you were the program to do that                here.                 (Laughter.)                 I think Dr. Kass is in charge of that program.                 (Laughter.)                 No.  I don't think there is a particular program that scientifically                could look at the moral or ethical issues.  There is no question                that we have in every one of our human subjects and animal subjects                a — you know, a very strong moral and ethical review based on institutional                review boards or the — you know, the typical ethical considerations                that you attach to research.                 But I think this one is not something that NIH is looking into,                feeling, and I said that in jest, but I think it's serious.                 I think all of the institutions that have looked at this issue would                be the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine.                 The administration feels that this is a debate that really needs                to happen in forums like this one.                  I don't know if I'm answering your question.                  DR. HURLBUT:   Well, I didn't really mean debate it.                 I mean, I think everybody agrees if you could de-differentiate an                adult cell down to an ES cell, a pluripotent cell, without making                it totipotent, that you would have a moral solution to the derivation                of ES cells.  And I just wondered if there's — if the science                might be ripe for a special program to seek those avenues and what                you might call morally derived ES cells.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Well, that's the adult stem cell program                in some ways.  That's what Dr. Verfaillie is trying to do by                using adult stem cells.  And then, going back in history and trying                to de-differentiate them, that's really the — now that I understand                your question, I mean, that is the hope of those investigators.                 Cord blood was another source that is used that does not have the                same moral connotation as human embryonic stem cells derived from                embryos.                 So yes, actually, if that's — I'm sorry.  I didn't                quite understand your question.  But absolutely, there are — as                you can see, there is a tremendous amount of activity in adult stem                cells and understanding the differentiation pathways.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   I have a couple of questions as well.                 In part, you give the impression that we're still at a very                early stage in the road from the bench to the bedside.  And you've                indicated at least some of the obstacles that — some of the steps                that would have to be taken and some of the obstacles in the way.                              One of the things that you didn't speak about was research                addressed to the immunoprotection problem.  And I wonder whether                there are special efforts in that area with respect to stem cell                research.                 And, second, notwithstanding the fact that we seem to be at a                very, very early stage in this research, you do indicate that there                is some work going on to look for fairly immediate clinical payoffs,                say in the area of cardiac disease.                 I wasn't absolutely clear that that was with human ES cell                — with cells derived from human sources or not.  But how do you                square the sense that on the one hand we are at a very, very early                stage, and on the other hand the field might be ripe already for                certain kinds of clinical trials.  What message should we take away                on that particular point?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   I think I may not have — I may not have                been clear, but what I refer to as ""host cell interactions""                imply immunological responses.  We need to understand those.  We                need to clearly make sure that either the transplant is not destroyed,                nor is the transplant left to grow in an uncontrolled fashion.                 So I didn't mean to ignore those issues.  They are there,                and they need to be addressed.                 Now, science, as you can imagine, advances by leaps and bounds,                and investigators have passion and sometimes believe there is a                shortcut or not a shortcut.  So that the two areas of research that                I think are driven to applications are those that, through what                I call, you know, recipes or lucky strikes or understanding of pathways,                whatever it is, try to find an application, a path to application,                in a proof of concept fashion, usually in animal systems.                 And that's really what researchers tend to do.  In other words,                you try to build from the solid ground you're at, and then you                go out and build an island, and then you fill in the blanks.                 The fill in the blanks are still in the basic region that I described.                 Even if you showed today that there was a recovery of cardiac function                through some pathway, you still will have to do the demonstration                that you understand the host cell interaction, you understand immune                response, you understand all of the safety considerations, and so                on.                 So I don't mean — in my view, they are not incompatible with                each other.  At least the characterizations I gave are very compatible.                               What happens typically in biomedical research, you have multiple                avenues, and that's the strength I think is to let people demonstrate                that.  Your question about, is it in humans — adult stem cells have                been reported to have been used in humans in Italy, in Brazil, from                bone marrow sources.  So adult sources that have then been implanted                in the heart, it is not clear, really, that it is the implantation                of those adult stem cells that has accomplished the result.                 We've had embryonic stem cells injected in rat hearts that                have been infarcted that showed recovery.  But those are proof of                concept experiments.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 Bill May.                  DR. MAY:   At one point you talked about arcing back from                pluripotent to totipotent.  Is a reversal from pluripotent to totipotent                in effect the creation of a new cell line?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   That's a very, very difficult question                for me to answer, because there's one experiment that showed                that, at least on the surface in a mouse model, that you had structures                that seemed to form not only a totipotent cell but an oocyte-like                structure.  So that — a blastocyst-like structure.                 So the question is:  are you creating a new cell line, or are                you creating a new organism — is not clear in that.  But this is                a very early area of research at this point.                  DR. MAY:   It does bear on the August 11th cutoff date I                guess, doesn't it?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   It could.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Michael, and then Janet.                  DR. GAZZANIGA:   Just a followup, because I think your point                on the human capital is important.  Sort of in the labs in various                biomedical institutions, there's an unwillingness on the part                of many young investigators to go into this field because of the                uncertainty of its political scientific status.                 And so there's an interaction here where if it was clear that                this program is going to move forward, it was clear that there are                going to be more lines developed, because certainly more lines are                going to be needed for a variety of biomedical issues, that the                human capital aspect of it might be solved very quickly.                 Certainly, that is what happens in all other fields which are                not constrained by the sort of — these sort of political moral issues.                 But if there's a new technique, gene expression work — as you                know, overnight it remade the field, the DNA chips, and so forth.                              So if it was clear what the policy would be in the future, wouldn't                your guess be that the human capital part would be solved rather                quickly?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Again, that's a question that goes from                a premise that there is an issue.  Clearly, when you look at the                increase in publications and names on publications, you see a lot                of new entrants.  I wasn't at the first meeting at NIH two years                ago about these issues, but the symposium that we had in June, 600                people all supported in some fashion or another.   How you compare                that to another field, I don't know.                 The other anecdotal piece of information is I visited a few sites,                and they don't report a dearth of post-doc candidates for their                programs.  Once they're established, you see — if you go to                Jamie Thomson, he has a tremendous amount of required — or demand                for trainees to come into his program as post-docs.                 And so once you have an established program, it seems like you                are able to attract people.  If you go to an institution where there's                no leader, no established program — I knew from my experience at                Hopkins, John Gearhart, he had his pick.  I mean, he could choose                whoever wanted to come.  So I think it's the program that drives                the young investigators to enter the field — program with funding,                with available resources.                 Is the fact that cell lines are under the policy a driver of going                and not going into the field?  I don't have the answer to that.                 But obviously, since this is an issue of federal funding, private                funding is also available, an avenue that is not prohibited, as                you know.  And the biotech industry — there was a recent report                that shows that there is still quite a bit of activity in the biotech                — and growing activity in the biotech industry for stem cell research.                              So I'm not sure that from the standpoint of human capital                that there is a monofactor here that you can identify, saying, ""Well,                this will prevent for sure the growth of human capital.""  I                can't answer that question in the affirmative.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Last question before we let Dr. Zerhouni                go.  Jim Wilson.                  PROF. WILSON:   Do you have any estimate — it would have                to be crude, I assume — as to how much money private sources are                putting into stem cell research?                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   Actually, there's a paper that was published                just recently, and I can give you a copy of it.  And this is not                an NIH study, but I understand that there is spending of $200 million                per year in stem cell research, embryonic stem cell research, and                1,000 FTEs, full-time equivalents doing research worldwide.                 About 60 percent of those are in the United States, about 15 in                Europe, and 27 percent in the rest of the world, primarily Australia,                Singapore, Korea, Japan.  I have that reference if you want it.                               PROF. WILSON:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Actually, if you can take one more, Janet                had been on the list — if you'll make it brief.                  DR. ROWLEY:   I just want to make a question and a comment.                 The comment is actually related to Kay Hubner's paper in  Science ,                and I think that it is important to recognize that this is work                that was done in the mouse.  And we've had a great deal of difficulty                in terms of translating success in the mouse and other animals into                humans, so this is going to take some time.                 The question is you mentioned that there is a program at NIH now                for characterizing these cells, and I wondered what institute it                was housed in.                  DR. ZERHOUNI:   The Institute — NINDS, neurological diseases,                under — actually, it's associated with Ron McKay's laboratory,                because we feel he has the best expertise in that area.                  DR. ROWLEY:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Dr. Zerhouni, thank you very, very much                for a wonderful presentation and very frank discussion.  We really                appreciate your presence.  Thank you.                 (Applause.)                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   As we learned from Dr. Zerhouni, we are                at a relatively early stage in our journey from basic stem cell                research to therapeutic benefits.  And as one looks ahead down this                road, we see in advance the important role that the FDA is going                to play in verifying the efficacy and the safety of any eventual                stem-based — stem cell based therapies.                 In recent months, the FDA issued its guidance regarding xenotransplantation,                the introduction into human beings of materials of animal origin                or derived from materials having contact with animal tissues.                 Almost immediately, there were press reports, many of them grossly                off the mark, about what this guidance might mean for the possibility                of future clinical trials using material derived from the Presidential                cell lines.                 To help us separate fact from fiction, and, more importantly,                to help us understand how the oversight and regulatory activities                of the FDA might eventually figure in the area of stem cell based                therapies, we're very fortunate to have with us Dr. Mark McClellan,                who is the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.                 Dr. McClellan, many thanks to you for taking the time to help                us understand this important aspect of the road that we are on that                will take us from the bench to the bedside.  Welcome.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Thank you, Dr. Kass.  And all of you on                this distinguished Council, thank you for inviting me here today                to discuss the role of the FDA in helping to make new safe and effective                xenotransplantation treatments available, including potentially                valuable stem cell treatments.                 FDA's job is to protect and advance the public health, and                one of our primary responsibilities involves helping safe and effective                products reach patients and consumers quickly.                 Our Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which I'm                sure many of you are familiar with — goes by the acronym CBER —                has the lead in FDA for regulating xenotransplantation, including                emerging cellular therapies.  FDA regulates cellular therapies under                broad authority from the Public Health Service Act and the Federal                Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.                 Under this authority, FDA has taken many steps to foster the development                of safe and effective stem cell therapies, while assuring appropriate                protections for human subjects involved in the research.                 As you know, xenotransplantation is a set of procedures that includes                the transplantation or implantation into a person of live cells                from non-human animal sources, including human cells that have had                ex vivo contact with live non-human animal cells or tissues.                 And as you just heard from Dr. Zerhouni, recent evidence suggests                that transplantation of cells and tissues may one day provide many                important therapeutic benefits for diseases such as neurodegenerative                disorders, diabetes, many other conditions involving organ dysfunctions                and cellular dysfunctions.  Because the potential health benefits                may be considerable, it's appropriate that there are many clinical                research and development studies going on now to better characterize                the risk and benefits of these potentially important treatments.                              Xenotransplantation products, under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic                Act are treated in accordance with our statutory provisions governing                premarket development.  And so they are subject to FDA review and                approval.  Investigators of such products should obtain FDA review                of proposed xenotransplantation clinical trials before proceeding.                              In addition to providing necessary assurances of protection for                human research subjects, FDA takes many steps in its regulatory                oversight to help researchers and product developers avoid mistakes                and translate good research ideas into safe and effective treatments                as efficiently as possible.                 And in an area as complex and with as many practical uncertainties                as stem cell research, this regulatory guidance can be extremely                helpful for obtaining the most public health benefit from basic                science insights.  For example, applied research conducted at CBER                has been instrumental in improving our understanding of safety issues                associated with xenotransplantation.                 CBER is engaged in a range of scientific investigation of safety                issues, including on known and emerging infectious agents, immunological                issues, transfer and differentiation issues, and others that will                need to be overcome for the safe and effective use of xenotransplantation                products.                 The results of these studies have helped CBER in its safety assessment,                including assessment of risk and the development of better diagnostic                methods and standards to assess risks.  CBER researchers are continuing                to develop assays appropriate for safety monitoring and are working                with sponsors and collaborating with other government scientists                in the development of these assays.                 In addition, to improve our regulatory policies related to xenotransplantation,                CBER working groups are analyzing data and events and developing                and proposing strategies for appropriate studies, for risk assessment,                for prevention, for communication, and agency response or regulatory                action, such as requests for more data from sponsors or for particular                product assays and the course of clinical investigation, or, when                necessary, the placement of clinical holds on clinical investigations.                              We discuss all of these proposals and strategies with our advisory                committees when needed or at public meetings as appropriate to make                sure we've got full opportunities for public comment on the                most effective way to regulate these important but complex new areas                of medical technology.                 CBER has also developed a mechanism for the systematic and regular                evaluation of the scientific and clinical literature relevant to                xenotransplantation as well as careful scientific evaluation of                the submissions that we get in our xenotransplantation product files.                              If you put all of that together, that not only the research studies                but what we see in terms of the studies, the details of the studies                that are ongoing now, not just the published studies but the ongoing                work, this amounts to the most extensive data available on the practical                application of stem cell technologies.                 We have a xenotransplantation product review or working group,                which consists of the review staff responsible for the review of                xenotransplantation submissions, the clinical product and pharmacology                and toxicology reviewers, as well as our veterinary staff.                  They all meet regularly to discuss application of the principles                that are in our relevant regulations and guidances to review and                discuss current scientific and medical data and literature relevant                to xenotransplantation, to review and discuss the current status                of xenotransplantation applications that are before the agency,                to discuss, the unique issues that these products may present and                to highlight areas of concern where further expert advice and solicitation                of public opinion, and outside expertise may be needed.                 This working group structure gives us an approach — gives us a                consistent and up-to-date review approach for xenotransplantation                applications, and it helps us recognize patterns or trends or common                problems that may be associated with xenotransplantation products,                and, again, a highly — a new and high emerging research area.  And                it should be communicated to xenotransplantation product developers                and other interested parties in a timely way.                 Our data evaluation and management process is linked to this regulatory                process, and it's applied during regulatory decisionmaking and                product and policy design at the agency.  We have augmented our                own experience with cell therapies by sponsoring and participating                in a large number of open public meeting and workshops, both domestic                and international, that focus in whole or in part on cellular therapies.                               These activities are essential for both sharing information and                receiving public input on relevant issues.  To make sure that our                insights and our assistance reach those involved in planning stem                cell trials effectively, FDA has also been proactive in educational                partnerships, workshops, and guidance development.                  And this work collectively includes discussing preclinical pharmacology                and toxicology studies, and good clinical practices, and product                characterization studies — all difficult issues that need to be                addressed effectively in these emerging sciences.                 All of this work is intended to support our goal of helping clinical                research and development of stem cell therapies proceed as efficiently                as possible.  And our extensive experience with cell therapy clinical                trials, and the processes for obtaining effective outside expertise,                has helped a wide variety of clinical studies involving xenotransplantation                of stem cells proceed with public confidence about safety and without                avoidable costs or complications for the subjects involved.                 With respect to the details of our oversight of clinical xenotransplantation                studies, as in other areas, FDA allows INDs — investigational new                drug applications — for these trials to proceed as long as they                don't pose unreasonable risks to the human subjects.                 Reflecting both the flexibility of our risk-based regulatory framework                and the energy of this important new research area, well over 1,000                separate INDs for all forms of cell therapies have been implemented                over the past decade.  Hundreds of subjects, hundreds of human subjects,                have received experimental products comprised of animal cells or                human cells that have had contact with animal cells since the early                1990s under FDA oversight.                 Hundreds of additional human subjects have been treated with a                human skin cell product called Epicell that was grown on mouse feeder                cell layers.  FDA discussed this Epicell product at a public advisory                meeting in January 2000, and we agreed with the advisory committee's                conclusion that the safety data concerning the use of the well characterized                mouse feeder cells in this case was sufficient to allow clinical                trials to proceed generally.                 And that is, the lesson here is that when murine cells can be                characterized as in this Epicell product, then as a general regulatory                matter there is no overarching need for monitoring and surveillance                with respect to this particular safety concern.                 FDA is continuing to support the development of safe and effective                cellular therapies, and we work directly with sponsors to help ensure                that all promising therapies can be clinically evaluated in an ethically                sound, scientifically rigorous, and efficient manner.                 The agency evaluates each individual product on its own merits.                 FDA's regulations, our guidances, and our policies, provide                useful information on safety and product development issues to help                sponsors interested in development of cellular products.                 CBER's regulatory guidance and regulations are continuing                to evolve, and this is appropriate to ensure that the continued                advancement of a very dynamic and growing field is matched by continuing                advancement in our regulatory guidances to support it.                 The hundreds of patients that have been treated in clinical trials                in which non-human animal cells have been implanted or infused directly,                or in which human cells that have had ex vivo contact with animal                cells have been administered, have been treated using protocols                that meet FDA safety standards.                 For Phase I or early clinical trials, the most important aspect                of safety is the demonstration of the products not contaminated                with adventitious infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria,                fungi, and so forth.  This safety criterion needs to be met, and                it has been met by most FDA-regulated products, including biological                products, before they can be used in the clinic.                 For all cellular products, including human cells, non-human cells,                animal cells, or human cells that have been exposed to such cells,                which often can't be tested for sterility prior to administration                because they can't always be stored, FDA has pursued a flexible                approach that does not compromise patient safety.  In particular,                FDA has allowed sponsors to administer the cells based on the results                of interim, in-process, bacterial and fungal sterility testing in                which the absence of infectious agents is demonstrated.                 The sponsors then perform sterility tests on the final product,                though results are frequently not available until after the products                have been administered.  A positive sterility test on the final                product is quite rare if the interim tests have been negative.                 But if the result is positive on the final test, the results of                these sterility tests are used to inform subsequent patient treatment.                              To address potential viral contaminants, FDA requests that prescreening                of components that could introduce viral infections occur.  For                example, before using porcine tests in humans, sponsors have been                asked to demonstrate that the pig tissue that they use doesn't                produce infectious porcine endogenous retrovirus.                 In the case of Epicell that I mentioned a few minutes ago, the                manufacturer was able to use standard techniques to show that the                transmission of murine viruses to the co-cultured human cells shouldn't                be a problem.  As a safety net, the recipients of animal cells or                human cells exposed to non-human animal cells are monitored for                unexpected infectious diseases.                 When human cells are transferred from one human to other humans,                whether or not animal cells enter the equation, FDA asks that the                human cells, and, if possible, the donors of those cells be thoroughly                tested for known viruses.  So we've overseen treatment of thousands                of patients with human cells or with animal cells, or with human                cells that have been exposed to animal cells, in which the transmission                of infection has been tightly controlled.                 Human embryonic stem cells are just one type of living human cells                among the many somatic cellular therapies that FDA regulates.  Most                of the issues that will be involved in the production of human embryonic                stem cells for clinical use are shared with these other cell therapies.                 Of course, there has been a high level of interest, as I've                heard in my time here today, in the research involving particular                human embryonic stem cell lines that are listed in the NIH registry.                              Just about all of these cell lines — all of these cell lines have                been in ex vivo contact with live, non-human animal cells or tissues.                 And the exposure of such human cells to animal cells, though, represents                only one of a large number of issues to be considered in evaluating                the development and use of human embryonic stem cells.                 Among the many further technical challenges to be addressed are                the manufacture and testing of the human embryonic stem cell products,                preclinical testing of human embryonic stem cells in animals to                show potential clinical benefit as well as potential toxicities,                appropriate clinical trial design issues, and appropriate followup                of human subjects treated with human embryonic stem cells.                 And our regulations and our guidance has to address that whole                panoply of issues.  Recognizing the potential importance of new                cellular therapies that may be derived from these cells, FDA extended                an invitation to each of the derivers of the NIH registry cell lines                to meet and discuss critical issues pertaining to the derivation                of these lines to help us assure safety in the clinical studies.                              We discussed FDA expectations of safety, and we gained insights                from the derivers on how they can best meet those expectations.                 We also gathered information from the derivers of the HES cell lines                regarding specific methods of preparation and propagation of the                cells to add to our understanding of the manufacturing of these                novel cell lines.                 FDA is in the process of publishing a series of guidance documents                through a notice and comment process to assist sponsors and investigators                interested in conducting clinical trials in the field of xenotransplantation.                               These documents are providing reasonably detailed and timely pragmatic                guidance to sponsors regarding xenotransplantation product safety                and clinical trial development, including specific recommendations                for how FDA believes that studies can be conducted efficiently and                with adequate safety assurances.                 The guidances that we published so far include a guidance for                industry for human somatic cell therapy and gene therapy published                in 1998, a guidance for reviewers on instructions and templates                for chemistry, manufacturing, and control of human somatic stem                cell investigational therapies, published in the past year.                 And, in addition, earlier this year we published a new xenotransplantation                guidance for industry entitled ""Source Animal Product Preclinical                and Clinical Issues Concerning the Use of Xenotransplantation Products                in Humans.""  All of these guidances are available online at                FDA.  We also recently just this past month published a draft guidance                for our reviewers to go along with this xenotransplantation guidance                for industry.                 These guidances provide information to sponsors interested in                developing products that include animal cells or exposure to animal                cells.  All of the human stem cell lines, as I mentioned earlier,                are subject to this guidance.                  And the goal here is to provide a comprehensive approach for the                regulation of xenotransplantation that efficiently addresses the                potential public health and safety issues associated with xenotransplantation,                and at the same time to provide guidance to sponsors, manufacturers,                and investigators regarding xenotransplantation product safety and                how to conduct clinical trial design and monitoring.                 One of the many issues that's addressed in the guidance is                the development of human embryonic stem cells that have had ex vivo                contact with mouse cells in clinical trials.  In our guidance, we                note that this guidance is relevant to all of the stem cell lines,                all of the human embryonic stem cell lines that have used mouse                feeder cell layers, and so fit into — this fits into the definition                of xenotransplantation used in our guidance and in our broader public                health service guidances.                 FDA has had a number of meetings, as I said, with the derivers                of these stem cell lines, and what the guidance focuses on is that                certain precautions are required to maintain the safe use of any                xenotransplantation product.  In the case of the existing embryonic                stem cell lines, the precautions include appropriate testing of                cells in mice if the mouse feeder cell layers continue to be used                for adventitious agents.                 This testing is manageable and is readily available and achievable                using current technologies.  So our xenotransplantation guidance                provides some specific, useful steps that sponsors can and should                take to address safety concerns.  A sponsor who wishes to investigate                a stem cell product derived from existing human embryonic stem cell                lines in a clinical trial may need to demonstrate to FDA that the                stem cell line is free from infectious agents, including the murine                infectious agents.                 Given the current technologies available as described in the guidance,                this should be feasible without undue burden.  The same recommendations                apply to other xenotransplantation products that contain human cells                with a history of co-culture with non-human animal cells.                 So overall we are very committed at FDA to evaluating each specific                product that comes into us on a case-by-case basis.  We try to augment                this with guidance to make it as straightforward as possible.  And                this is important, because in a world where most clinical trials                and most products that enter clinical development fail to show benefit,                each new individual proposed clinical study might still provide                a crucial step forward.                 There are multitudes of patients who have yet to benefit from                the biotechnology revolution, and as a public health agency we are                committed to making sure that every experimental product to be tested                in humans is as safe as possible, with the ultimate goal of getting                safe and effective products as quickly as possible.                 I want to thank you all for listening to me today, giving an overview                of FDA's regulatory and guidance activities in this important                area of emerging science, and I'd be pleased to answer any questions                that you all might have.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you very much.                  Dan Foster, are you on the way to — no, I'm sorry.                 Let me start and, first of all, thank you, really, for a very                comprehensive and helpful account.  And I emphasize that because                I'm going to ask a sort of flat-footed and dumb couple of questions.                 If I wanted to say, Dr. McClellan, the take-home lesson, if I wanted                to sort of put it in a nutshell, would be xenotransplantation involving                stem cells in contact with murine cells, we have experience with                that, and we are careful.                  We know what to do, and it's — while it's something to                be paid attention to, it's not an insurmountable obstacle or                one that deserves extra special attention.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   We've certainly had experience, successful                experience, in thousands of patients in documenting the safety of                cells that have been exposed to animal feeder cells, mouse feeder                cells, and the like.                  The other take-home lesson that I think is important is that while                this is a very important emerging area of technology, this is a                quite complex cellular therapy that presents many new safety issues                as well as effectiveness issues that have to be evaluated.                  And we've got multiple parallel efforts to try to assess and                help manage and address the different risks that are involved in                stem cell therapy treatments, so that we can hopefully as a result                get more rapid development of stem cell therapies that really work,                and that can be used widely.                  But as is the case with all of the biologicals, especially complex                new technologies like this, ultimately it's nature that determines                whether the products are really going to benefit the needy if we                can — and we need to unlock, through a whole — evaluation of a whole                host of complex safety and effectiveness issues, whether they can                — whether those benefits can be demonstrably given to patients.                 And we're still very early on in that process.                 And the mouse feeder cell issues are one area where we have a                regulatory process in place to address it, but there are many other                safety and effectiveness concerns that remain to be addressed, and                that we're working hard to help product developers address effectively.                                                   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  And let me just very quickly                — am I right in thinking that cells grown on human feeder cell layers                would be subjected to — have to be subjected to the same kinds of                —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Yes, they do.  They are incorporated in                our same xenotransplantation guidance, and they are subject to the                same kind of evaluation of potential exposure to adventitious infectious                agents.  They need to go through the same kind of testing procedures                and the like.                                CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.                 Questions or comments?  Dr. Gómez-Lobo.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   This is a question out of total                ignorance.  I have great confidence in FDA.  In fact, I think it's                a great institution and —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   I do, too.                  DR. GÓMEZ-LOBO:   Well, I'm glad you do.  But                here's my question.  I'm also convinced that human knowledge                is very limited, and you speak with great confidence about identifying                bacteria and viruses, etcetera.  Could it be the case that at a                nano level there might be problems, say, with some of these products                that we cannot yet detect?                  In other words, what I'm thinking about is, what's the                next step when we go into, say, gene therapy and that kind of thing?                 Is FDA going to be able to detect any problems with that?  Should                we be cautious, or should we just trust FDA and just rush forward?                  In other words, it's a very general, sort of prudential question                that I'm raising.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Yes, that is a good general question.                 FDA is not usually accused of making people rush forward, but glad                to hear that's —                 (Laughter.)                 — the perception in at least some corridors.                 These are very challenging new technologies, and there's a                great scientific concept out there and a great potential.  And that's                something that generates a lot of media interest, and the like,                and holds out a lot of hope.  I think, you know, with some reason                that we are going to be able to bring new benefits, important new                benefits, to many millions of patients that don't have effective                treatments available today.                 But as with so many other areas of emerging technologies, moving                from ideas that seem to work well even at the proof of concept stage,                to treatments that demonstrably can be shown reliably to be safe                and effective in patients is very difficult.  And we are early in                that process now for these complex biological treatments.                 I have talked a lot about some of the issues related to transmission                of infectious diseases related to feeder cells, because that's                gotten a lot of the attention.  But you're absolutely right                that there are a host of other important safety issues and effectiveness                issues that also need to be much better understood before these                treatments can be used reliably and confidently by the public to                improve the health of the public.                 And that's what this investigational process is really all                about.  That's why we have a comprehensive guidance for the                INDs involving stem cell therapies and many other types of therapies                as well, so that we can conduct those studies in a way that's                — that relies on the best-available knowledge as to whether we're                presenting patients with unreasonable risk.                 We can do it in a controlled setting, so that we can learn from                the latest studies and add to the state of knowledge that exists                from what goes before.  And then we can modify our research protocols                and guidances and research activities accordingly.                 But this is a difficult process.  You know, a lot of people talk                about the fact that it takes over a decade for going from — for                something as simple as a small molecule drug, just a simple chemical,                from the time that it's first identified and people first suspect                that it's going to have a benefit in patients.  It can take                well over a decade to go from that proof of concept to a product                being commercially available to the public.                 It's a long, complicated process.  And these complex biological                treatments and cellular therapies are far more complex and have                far more potential interactions and consequences that are not well                understood than a simple small molecule drug.                  So this is an ongoing process, a careful one, and I don't                think we're rushing headlong into this.  But at the same time,                I want to make sure that our regulatory staff is apprised of all                of the latest science, is working closely with researchers and others                involved in product development, to make sure that we're making                the most of the available knowledge, both for the sake of the patients                that are involved in these clinical studies and for the sake of                creating the knowledge base we need to get safe and effective treatments                to patients as quickly as possible.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Rebecca Dresser.                   PROF. DRESSER:   Thank you very much for your overview.                 I guess a comment and a question.  I do think it's interesting                there has been so much in the press about this particular issue                as a potential safety issue as I think you've observed, compared                to other safety issues that this technology might present such as                tumor risk and, you know, the ability to channel the cells into                the —                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Pluripotency.                   PROF. DRESSER:   — appropriate tissue, and all of those                things.  So it seems that in some ways you and your colleagues are                being forced to address this issue, at least publicly, with more                attention than these other issues.  And I'm glad to hear that                you're thinking about these other issues.                 But I guess just to play devil's advocate, isn't there                a risk with xenotransplants that there is an undetected animal virus,                an undetectable virus we don't even know about, that could be                present and transmitted if the cells are grown on animal feeder                layer, that wouldn't be a risk if you had, you know, the absence                of a feeder layer or a human feeder layer?  And so wouldn't                it be nice if you could avoid that risk?                   DR. McCLELLAN:   It's certainly possible that there                are completely unknown, you know, animal viruses that could potentially                be transmitted to humans.                  We just haven't ever seen them observed, and that's why                an important part of our guidances here is followup on the patients                who are involved in these studies, so that as we learn more over                time we'll be able to identify any problems that might subsequently                emerge in the patients that have been brave enough to participate                in these early studies, and to make sure that we can let the patients                know if there is new technology that becomes available that ought                to influence their subsequent treatment.                 But there are — you know, those kinds of hypotheticals exist in                each and every one of these many complicated aspects of stem cell                therapy.  There are the potential for human cells to harbor completely                unknown illnesses that might also be transmitted.                 It might even be easier to transmit to humans than in animals,                and even for cells that are harvested and used in treatment without                the use of any kind of feeder layers.  There are still a host of                other issues, as you identified, that could present important safety                concerns.                 We do have to make our regulatory decisions and allow studies                to go forward under uncertainty.  You know, these issues are never                going to be fully resolved, and I think that the best job we can                do is try to make sure we're apprised of all of the latest science,                all of the, you know, concerns that might impact on potential risks                and benefits for patients involved in the studies, and then do as                careful of a job as possible in making sure that the best and latest                knowledge is applied as we move forward in this important area of                emerging science.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Thank you.  Permit me one very quick question.                 You've indicated how your experience with xenotransplantation                in other areas gives you some confidence that you might not have                received with this aspect of it.                  Is there any precedent and experience for dealing with the specific                kind of risk of teratoma or tumors that are associated with — well,                possibly it could be associated with, say, residual, undifferentiated                stem cells that might accompany a population that have been differentiated?                                DR. McCLELLAN:   That's certainly something that we're                monitoring for here.  And some of the — and in many of the earlier                human stem cell — I mean, human cellular studies that — or cellular                studies more generally, they were differentiated cells involved.                               And so it raised different kinds of issues than a pluripotent                or an undifferentiated stem cell might.  It's definitely something                that's on people's minds, and we're watching carefully.                 We don't know of any specific evidence of important problems                there yet that we haven't accounted for, but we are monitoring                it carefully.                  I think that's one reason we pay so much attention in these                protocols to understanding and tracking the exact conditions under                which the cells were derived, because that can potentially have                an impact on how they might differentiate and act in — after implantation                subsequently.  It's just an area where we have to watch closely,                because it's not very well understood.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, Dr. McClellan, thank you very much                for being with us, for your presentation, and for your very good                work.                   DR. McCLELLAN:   Thank you.                  CHAIRMAN KASS:   We're adjourned for 15 minutes.                 (Applause.)                        (Whereupon, the proceedings in the foregoing matter went                off the record at 3:35 p.m. and went back on the record at 3:55                p.m.)"
GX044-81-2421042	This topic was discussed at the Council's  October              2003  meeting. This working paper was prepared by staff solely              to aid discussion, and does not represent the official views of the              Council or of the United States Government.                    Staff Working Paper               Applications of Human Stem Cells                in Research and Medicine                               Introduction                 Research using human and animal stem cell preparations continues                to be an extremely active area.  It is developing new research tools,                new knowledge about pathways of cell differentiation and opening                new vistas of cell transplantation therapy for human diseases.                 As part of an approach to fulfilling its mandate to “monitor stem                cell research”, The President’s Council on Bioethics asked several                experts to contribute review articles on various areas of stem cell                research (see articles by Drs. Gearhart 1 ,                Itescu 2 , 3 ,                Jaenisch 4                 Ludwig and Thomson 5 ,                Prentice 6                 and Verfaillie 7                 in the Appendices).  These reviews and the present paper emphasize                peer-reviewed, published work with stem cell preparations through                July 2003.  Interested readers should also consult the wide variety                of review articles on these types of stem cells that have appeared                previously 8 .                                 Heterogeneous human stem cell preparations derived from bone marrow                have been in clinical use as treatment (bone marrow transplants)                for various forms of cancer for many years.  More recently, hematopoietic                stem cells have been isolated and purified from bone marrow and                are being studied 9 .                 Because this is a clinically well-established part of current medical                treatment, we will not emphasize it further in this report. Instead                we will focus on new types of stem cell preparations, and ways in                which they might be used in research and medical treatment.                  This paper provides additional background on selected aspects                of recent work with human embryonic and adult stem cells.  It is                intended to be read in conjunction with the review articles cited                above.  It emphasizes some general considerations involved in obtaining                reproducible results in experiments with stem cell preparations.                 It focuses on work with human stem cell preparations that can be                reproducibly isolated and considerably expanded through growth in                vitro, while maintaining the essential characteristics of stem cells.                 It also describes the current state of progress toward development                of stem cell-based therapies for some specific human diseases.                 Stem cells share two characteristic properties: 1) unlimited or                 prolonged   self-renewal capacity (i.e. the capability                to maintain a pool of undifferentiated stem cells), and 2) the potential                to produce two or more  differentiated  descendent cell types                (see Figure 1).  As embryonic stem cells differentiate, they generally                become more restricted in the differentiated cell types that they                can generate.                               Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Some Stages in Cell Differentiation                                Under the influence of various cell differentiation signals, embryonic                stem cells i                 differentiate into multiple descendent stem cells [dashed box area                of Figure 1.]  These descendent stem cells can also self-renew,                that is, they can undergo cell division to produce more descendent                stem cells while retaining their ability to differentiate into multiple                cell types.  With increasing frequency, such cells are being isolated                from various “adult” tissues such as bone marrow (e.g. mesenchymal                or stromal stem cells) and brain (e.g. neural stem cells) [see (6)].                               Subsequent exposure to additional cellular differentiation signals                can cause the descendent stem cells to differentiate further, so                that they finally become the wide variety of differentiated tissue                cells that make up the adult body (labeled A-D in Figure 1).  At                each stage of the differentiation process, specific sets of genes                are expressed (and other sets are repressed or turned off), so that                hundreds of specific proteins, which give the cells their differentiated                properties, can be produced.  Specialized proteins called transcription                factors play key roles in determining which sets of genes are expressed                and repressed.                 The terminology used in describing the isolation and properties                of different stem cell types can sometimes be confusing.  In this                paper,  adult  stem cells [see (6)] are preparations from humans                or animals isolated after birth that have the characteristic two                properties described above.   Embryonic  stem cell preparations                [see (5)] isolated from the inner cell mass of early human embryos                show these same two characteristic properties, and are abbreviated                “hESCs”.  Human cell preparations isolated from fetal germ cell                tissue [see (1)] have similar properties to hESCs cells and are                abbreviated “hEGCs”.                  Reproducible Results Using Stem Cell Preparations                and Their Derivatives                  A major goal of scientific research is the production of reliable                knowledge based upon reproducible results.  To obtain reproducible                results in experiments using stem cells, it is essential to produce,                preserve and characterize stem cell preparations so that they generate                reproducible results when the same experiment is repeated.  As described                in more detail below, the tendency of stem cell preparations to                differentiate into more specialized cells  in   vitro                 makes the task of obtaining homogeneous stem cell preparations that                will generate reproducible results especially challenging.  Failure                to address these problems with appropriate experimental methods                may yield experimental results that are difficult or impossible                to reproduce.                                  Initial Stem Cell Preparations Can Contain Multiple Cell Types                               Isolation of  adult  stem cells from source tissues initially                yields a heterogeneous cell preparation.  The initial preparation                contains cells from the source tissue and may also include red blood                cells, white blood cells and possibly circulating stem cells.  Initial                mixtures of cells may then be treated in various ways to remove                unwanted contaminating cells, thereby increasing the percentage                of adult stem cells in the preparation.  Seldom (if ever) does one                produce an adult stem cell preparation that is 100% adult stem cells,                unless the adult stem cell preparation has been “single cell cloned”                 in   vitro  (see below).                 Isolation of hESC cell preparations from ICM cells of blastocyst-stage                embryos raises similar questions about the homogeneity of the initial                cell preparations.  In the past, many hESC cell preparations were                initially isolated by  in   vitro  growth on top of irradiated                “feeder” layers of mouse cells.  More recently, several groups have                shown that it is possible to grow hESCs on feeder layers of human                cells, including fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies, or without                any feeder cells 10 .                 It is thought that the feeder cells secrete factor(s) that enable                the stem cells to replicate while maintaining a relatively undifferentiated                phenotype.  Subsequent  in   vitro  growth of human stem                cell preparations grown on mouse cells  may  have carried along                some viable mouse cells.                  Genetically homogeneous stem cell preparations through “single                cell cloning”                  Stem cell preparations growing  in   vitro  are sometimes                “single cell cloned” by placing a cylinder over a single cell located                with a microscope.  Further cell division by this isolated single                cell within the cylinder produces a cell preparation in which all                the cells are descended from the originally isolated single cell.                 The cells within the cylinder are then harvested and expanded further                 in   vitro .  The resulting stem cell preparation is                said to be “single cell cloned”.  The stem cells within a “single                cell cloned” preparation are homogeneous in the sense that they                are all derived from the same original cell.  Some of the human                embryonic stem cell preparations produced prior to August 9, 2001                have been “single cell cloned” 11 ,                and are then called stem cell “lines”.               In vitro propagation, freezing and storage at low temperature                Stem cell preparations can be grown  in   vitro  so                that the cells multiply, and many, presumably identical, vials of                the cells can then be frozen and preserved at very low temperatures.                 Frozen stem cell preparations can then be thawed and grown again                 in   vitro  to produce larger numbers of cells.  Selective                pressures involved in both the  in   vitro  growth process                and the freezing step can increase the heterogeneity of a stem cell                preparation by favoring the multiplication of cell variants in the                preparation.  Whether or not several cycles of freezing and thawing                change the phenotypic characteristics of stem cell preparations                has not been much studied.  However, the practical advantages of                preserving multiple samples of stem cell preparations by freezing                are too large to ignore. These advantages are central to the ability                to repeat an experiment with a very similar stem cell preparation,                and to the ability to treat multiple patients with a stem cell preparation                derived initially from a single donor sample.                 Normal human stem cells have 46 chromosomes, 22 pairs plus two                X chromosomes if they are from a female, or 22 pairs plus one X                and one Y chromosome if they are from a male.  During the copying                of chromosomal DNA and the separation of daughter chromosomes at                cell division, rare mistakes occur that lead to the formation of                abnormal chromosomes.  Cells with abnormal chromosomes can progress                to malignancy, so retention of the normal human chromosome number                and organization is an essential characteristic of useful stem cell                preparations.  Human stem preparations generally have normal chromosome                numbers and structure, and appear to retain this property better                than mouse stem cell preparations 7                  12  .                Developmental heterogeneity of stem cell preparations  The  in                vitro  growth conditions and the presence of specific chemicals              and/or proteins in the growth medium can influence the differentiation              pathway taken by stem cells as they start to differentiate.  Thus,              even genetically homogeneous “single cell cloned” stem cell preparations              may become  developmentally   heterogeneous  with respect              to the percentage of cells in the preparation that are in one or another              differentiated state.  So, for example, a particular stem cell preparation              after growth  in   vitro  under particular conditions might              contain 75% differentiated cells and 25% remaining stem cells.  The              biological properties of the differentiated cells and the stem cells              are likely to be different.  If such a cell preparation is transplanted              into an animal and a biological effect is observed, one must do additional              experiments to determine whether the effect was due to the 75% differentiated              cells or the 25% stem cells in the preparation.  Microbial contamination               Stem cell preparations originally isolated from humans and expanded               in   vitro  may also be variably contaminated with human              viruses, bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma.  hESC preparations isolated              using mouse feeder cell layers might also be contaminated with mouse              viruses.  Specific tests need to be performed on the source tissue              and resulting stem cell preparations to rule out the presence of these              contaminants, and the stem cells need to be propagated in the presence              of antibiotics to discourage the growth of bacteria and fungi.  Some              of these contaminants can also multiply when stem cells are grown               in   vitro  and their presence can change the results obtained              when stem cell preparations are used in subsequent experiments.  The              presence of such contaminants can also potentially affect the reproducibility              of the results of experiments in which stem cell preparations are              studied  in   vivo  in experimental animals.     In summary,                researchers must address several factors in order to maximize the                probability of obtaining reproducible results with stem cell preparations.                 The more stem cell preparations are:                                 “single cell cloned”, with a normal chromosome structure and                  number, and                   multiple samples preserved by storage at very low temperature,                  and                   compared in experiments where cells from the same lot of frozen                  material are used, and                   well-characterized as to the absence of cellular, viral, bacterial,                  fungal and mycoplasma contaminants, and                   tested to determine the proportion of stem cells and various                  differentiated cells in the cell preparation used in the experiments,                                              the greater the likelihood that results in experiments with stem                cell preparations will be reproducible.  Human stem cell preparations                with these properties will be in the forefront of stem cells that                are useful in basic research and that will be investigated for possible                clinical applications.                 In the remainder of this paper, we discuss primarily stem cell                preparations that exemplify the considerations listed above.  We                focus on mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells among adult                stem cell preparations, and on hESC and hEG cells among embryonic                stem cell preparations.  For information on the wide variety of                other stem cell preparations isolated from adult tissues, see reference                6.  Further research on some of these other adult stem cell preparations                may reveal that they can also be “single cell cloned”, grown extensively                in vitro, cryopreserved, and characterized as to the absence of                contaminants.  At that point, it would be very important to compare                the properties of these other adult stem cells, and more differentiated                cells that can be derived from them, with the already characterized                embryonic and adult stem cell preparations.                Major Types of Stem Cell Preparations  Human adult stem              cell preparations      Stem cell preparations that multiply                extensively and continuously  in   vitro  have been isolated                from a variety of human tissues, including bone marrow, brain, cord                blood, teeth and various organs (for details, see reference 6).                 The focus in this section will be on two of the best studied of                these, mesenchymal stem cells iv                 from bone marrow, and on neural stem cells isolated from brain tissue.                             Human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow     The bone                marrow contains at least two major stem cells, hematopoietic stem                cells that give rise to the red cells and white cells of the blood 8 ,                and a cell type that adheres in vitro in plastic culture dishes                called mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).  As described originally by                A.J. Friedenstein, M.E. Owen and A.I. Caplan and their coworkers 13 ,                these MSCs were studied primarily as precursors of bone.  More recent                work has indicated that these cells can be reproducibly isolated                and expanded in vitro, and that they can give rise to cartilage,                bone, adipose (fat), and muscle cell lineages 14                 in vitro.                 The phenotypic characteristics (morphology, expressed proteins                and biological properties) of these cells have been somewhat difficult                to characterize, because they appear to vary depending upon the                in vitro culture conditions and the specific cell preparation (see                discussion in reference 15).  A molecular analysis of genes expressed                in a single cell-derived colony of these cells provided evidence                for the expression of genes also turned on in bone, cartilage, adipose,                muscle, hematopoiesis-supporting stromal, endothelial and neuronal                cells 15 .                 It is possible that the cells within the colony entered into distinct                cell differentiation pathways, resulting in a heterogeneous population                composed of several different cell types.                 hMSCs are important stem cells for research and therapy for several                reasons.  First, because they can be differentiated in vitro into                multiple cell types, they are making possible detailed research                on the molecular events that underly differentiation into bone 16                 cartilage, and fat cell lineages.  Second, they have recently been                shown to                 support the in vitro growth of human  embryonic  stem cells 17 ,                thus replacing the mouse feeder cells used previously.  This would                obviate concerns about xenotransplantation if the hESCs or their                derivatives were ever used in human clinical transplantation therapies.                 In addition, clinical studies are already underway in which hMSCs                are co-transplanted with autologous hematopoietic stem cells to                replace the blood cell-forming system of cancer patients who have                received high dose chemotherapy 18 .                 As summarized by Itescu [see (2)], MSCs may also prove to be important                in modulating the immune system to more readily accept foreign tissue                grafts.  Finally, hMSCs have the potential for cell replacement                therapies in injuries involving bone, tendon or cartilage, and are,                in fact, already being tested as experimental therapies for the                human diseases osteogenesis imperfecta, metachromatic leukodystrophy,                and Hurler syndrome (a lysosomal storage disease) 19 .                              The relationship between hMSCs and the Multipotent Adult Progenitor                Cells (MAPCs) described by Verfaillie and coworkers [see (7)] needs                to be clarified by further research.  Both cell preparations are                isolated as adherent cells from bone marrow aspirates.  Each can                be differentiated in vitro into cells with cartilage, bone and fat                cell properties.  They express several of the same cell antigens,                but are reported to differ in some others 7 .                 MAPCs have to be maintained at specific, low cell densities in vitro,                otherwise they tend to differentiate into MSCs 7 .                 Two recent publications make clear how the properties of the final                cell preparations reflect both a heterogeneity in growth properties                of the mesenchymal stem cells as isolated in vitro, and the emergence                of different gene expression profiles as the cells go through multiple                populations doublings in vitro 20 .                             Human neural stem cells                                                                                     Stem cells capable of differentiating into one or more neural                cell lineage (i.e. astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, neuron) can be isolated                from brain tissue (particularly the olfactory bulb 21 )                and grown in vitro.  There appear to be at least two types of neural                stem cells, one from the subventricular zone (SVZ), and another                from other brain regions 22 .                 In the presence of purified growth factor proteins, the cells can                be expanded by growth in vitro as round clumps of cells called neurospheres.                 However, many neurospheres in culture are developmentally heterogeneous,                and the number of self-renewing stem cells is frequently low (<5%) 22 .                              Human neural stem cells from developing human cortex, expanded                in culture with epidermal growth factor (EGF), become senescent                (cease dividing) after 30-40 population doublings 23 .                 Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allowed the growth of a self-renewing                neural stem cell preparation for up to 110 population doublings.                 Studies using Affymetrix “gene chips” provided evidence for the                expression of specific members of important growth factor and signal                transduction gene families.  Withdrawal of LIF led to decreased                expression of 200 genes 23 .                 The magnitude and specificity of the molecular information relevant                to the regulation of neural stem cell multiplication obtained in                this experiment powerfully illustrates the usefulness of stem cell                preparations in basic biomedical research.                 Human neural stem cell preparations can be transduced in vitro                with foreign genes so that the treated cells now express readily                visualized specific proteins, such as Green Fluorescent Protein                (GFP).   This makes it possible to track GFP-marked human neural                stem cells after they are injected into experimental animals, to                determine whether they survive and migrate following injection.                 Studies of this type have provided evidence that human neural cells                can migrate extensively after injection 24 .                  In addition, such cells can be injected into animal models of human                diseases such as intracerebral hemorrhage and Parkinson’s Disease                (PD) to study their effect on the progression of the disease 25 .                 Although human neural stem cells may not yet be as well characterized                as mesenchymal stem cells or hESCs, they are being actively studied                with the hope that they can be used in future treatments for devastating                neurological diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease and PD.                             Human adult stem cells from other sources    Prentice [see                (6)] has summarized a large amount of current information on stem                cell preparations isolated from amniotic fluid, peripheral blood,                umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, brain tissue, muscle, liver,                pancreas, cornea, salivary gland, skin, tendon, heart, cartilage,                thymus, dental pulp and adipose tissue.  In several of these cases,                the stem cells isolated are of animal rather than human origin.                 In other cases, the long-term expandability in vitro of the stem                cell preparations was not demonstrated.   Studies of many of the                stem cell preparations from these sources are just getting started,                and further work is needed to determine their biological properties                and their relatedness to other stem cell types.  The demonstration                that they can be isolated from such tissue compartments in animals                should spur the search for similar human stem cell types.                Human embryonic stem cell preparations    Human embryonic                stem cell (hESC) preparations have been isolated from the inner                cell masses of blastocyst-stage human embryos in multiple laboratories                throughout the world iii .                 As of July 2003, 12 hESC preparations are available for shipment                to recipients of U.S. federal research grants, out of a total of                78 eligible hESC preparations iv .                 Limited characterization data for most of the 12 currently available                hESC preparations is summarized in reference 12.  The review by                Ludwig and Thomson 5                 lists more than 40 peer-reviewed hESC primary research papers that                have been published since the initial publication in 1998.                  Although isolated from different blastocyst-stage embryos in laboratories                in different parts of the world, hESC preparations have a number                of properties in common.                 These include expression of common cell surface antigens recognized                by binding of specific antibodies, expression of the enzyme alkaline                phosphates, and production of the gene-regulating transcription                factor Oct-4 12 .                 Many hESC preparations have been cryopreserved at low temperatures                so they can be well characterized and compared with one another.                              hESC preparations are initially isolated as colonies of undifferentiated                cells on “feeder” layers of mouse or human cells.  The feeder cells                are believed to supply protein and perhaps other cell products that                are needed by the ESCs to retain the property of symmetrical self-renewal.                 Appropriately supplemented, the culture medium from feeder layer                cells can sustain ESCs  in   vitro .  The culture medium                from mouse feeder layer cells is very complex, containing hundreds                if not thousands of different proteins 26 .                 Purified Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) can replace the feeder                cell layer requirement for mouse ESCs, but not for human ESCs.                               hESC preparations have been differentiated  in   vitro                 into neural (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), cardiac                (synchronously contracting cardiomyocytes), endothelial (blood vessels),                hematopoietic (multiple blood cell lineages), hepatocyte (liver                cell), and trophoblast (placenta) lineages 5 .                 In the case of neural and cardiac lineages, similar results have                been obtained in different laboratories using different hESC preparations,                thus fulfilling the “reproducible results” criterion described above.                 For other lineages, the results described have not yet been reproduced                in another laboratory.                Cloned embryonic stem cells    Somatic cell nuclear transfer                (SCNT) creates cloned embryos from which cloned embryonic stem cells                can be isolated [see (4)].  In theory, using cloned embryonic stem                cells from individual patients might provide a way around the possible                immune rejection problem (see below).  To date, such experiments                have only been successful with mouse cells.  However, they have                made possible an experiment demonstrating the potential of cloned                embryonic stem cells in the possible future treatment of genetic                diseases.  Rideout et al 27 used                a mutant mouse strain that was deficient in immune system function.                 They produced a cloned mouse stem cell line carrying the mutation,                and then specifically repaired that gene mutation in vitro.  The                repaired cloned stem cell preparation was then differentiated  in                  vitro  into bone marrow precursor cells. When these precursor                cells were injected back into the genetically mutant mice, they                produced an observed partial restoration of immune system function.                              Production of cloned  human  embryonic stem cell preparations                remains technically very difficult and ethically controversial.                 Recently however, Chen and coworkers 28                 have reported that fusion of human fibroblasts with enucleated rabbit                oocytes leads to the development of embryo-like structures from                which cell preparations with properties similar to human embryonic                stem cells can be isolated.  This work needs to be confirmed by                repetition in other laboratories. In addition, further work is needed                to decisively settle the question of whether rabbit mitochondrial                DNA and rabbit mitochondrial proteins persist in the embryonic stem                cell preparations.  Persistence of rabbit mitochondrial proteins                in the cloned stem cell preparations could possibly enhance the                possibility of immune rejection of the cells, thus limiting their                clinical application.                Embryonic germ cells              Gearhart [see (1)] has summarized the results of recent research with              human and animal EG cells.  Regulation of imprinted genes was the              focus of one study with human EG cells, which showed “that general              dysregulation of imprinted genes will not be a barrier to their use              in transplantation studies”.  In addition, Kerr et al 29               showed that cells derived from hEG cells, when introduced              into the cerebrospinal fluid of rats became extensively distributed              over the length of the spinal cord and expressed markers of various              nerve cell types.  Rats paralyzed by a virus-induced nerve cell loss              recovered partial motor function after transplantation with the human              cells.  The authors suggested that this could be due to the secretion              of transforming growth factor-± and brain-derived growth factor by              the transplanted cells and subsequent enhancement of rat neuron survival              and function. Basic Research Using Stem Cells                Stem cell preparations are proving useful in basic research in                at least two ways.  First, they are useful in unraveling the complex                molecular pathways governing cell differentiation.  For example,                preparations of embryonic stem cells can be induced to become more                differentiated cells  in   vitro .  In one case, this                has made available quantities of human trophoblast-like cells that                are difficult to obtain from other sources 30 .                 Since, in the best circumstances, these can be quite homogeneous                cell preparations, their gene expression profiles can be compared                in detail 16 ,                 23 .                 In addition, cultures of differentiated cells derived from stem                cells could be used to test new chemical compounds for toxicity                and mutagenicity 31 .                 As experience with these differentiated derivatives of hESCs grows,                it may become possible to reduce or eliminate the use of live animals                for toxicity and mutagenicity testing of new chemical compounds.                              The ability to grow large, relatively homogeneous populations                of human stem cells and their more differentiated descendants  in                  vitro  means that one can now study certain molecular aspects                of cell differentiation  in   vitro .  The genes expressed                by the stem cell population can be compared with the genes expressed                by the differentiated cell population in order to characterize the                differentiated cell not just by one or two biological markers, but                by the expression pattern of hundreds or thousands of genes.  Genes                specifically expressed by stem cells that are important to maintaining                their specific properties are being identified 32                 Research of this kind is providing insight as to the role of specific                transcription factors in switching gene sets off and on as cell                differentiation progresses.                How might stem cell preparations be used to treat diseases?                  In general, one approach to using human stem cells in                future therapies starts from the isolation of a cell that can be                maintained in the undifferentiated state and expanded substantially                by growth  in   vitro .  A large number of undifferentiated                stem cells could then be stored in the frozen state, characterized                 in   vitro , and used as a reproducible starting material                from which to prepare differentiated cell preparations that express                beneficial properties when transplanted into patients with specific                diseases.  To make more concrete both the potential and problems                with this approach, we discuss the potential problem of immune rejection                of the transplanted cells, and summarize some current information                on the properties of cells derived from  human  stem cell populations                in an animal model of Type-1 diabetes as a case-study example.                Will stem cell-based therapies be limited by immune rejection?               Much of the impetus for stem cell research comes from the hope              that stem cell preparations, or more differentiated cells derived              from them, will one day prove useful in cell transplantation therapies              for various human diseases.  It may cost too much and take too long              to produce a sufficient number of well-characterized cells for therapy              if one starts with cells from each individual patient.  This suggests              that cells derived from the stem cells of one individual will be used              to treat multiple other individual patients (allogeneic cell transplantation).               When allogeneic transplantation is done with e.g. bone marrow, kidney              or heart, powerful immunosuppressive drugs must be used to prevent              imunological rejection of the transplanted tissue 2 .               Without such immunosuppression (with its undesirable side effects),              host T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells recognize molecules              on the transplanted cells as “foreign” and attack and destroy the              transplanted cells.  In whole organ transplantation,  donor               T-lymphocytes and NK cells can also react against the tissues of the              host (called graft vs. host disease).                One type of experiment that has been done to examine this possibility                was to examine human embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell preparations                growing  in   vitro  for the expression of gene products                known to play important roles in the immune rejection process.                 Drukker et al 33                 showed that hESC preparations  in  vitro express very low levels                of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins on their                cell surface. Expression of MHC-I proteins increased moderately                when the hESC cells differentiated in vitro or in vivo.  A more                pronounced increase in MHC-I protein expression was observed when                the hESCs were treated with ³-interferon.  These experiments indicate                that expression of MHC-I proteins that can play important roles                in immune rejection can depend on the differentiated state of the                cells and upon the presence of specific immune effector molecules                like ³-interferon in the environment.                 Similarly, Majumdar et al 34                 showed that human mesenchymal stem cell preparations  in   vitro                 express multiple proteins on their cell surfaces that would enable                them to bind to, and interact with, T lymphocytes.  The presence                of such molecules helps to explain the observed ability of hMSCs                to modulate immune reactions in vitro and in vivo (see references                in 2).  Majumdar et al also observed that ³-interferon increased                both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II molecules                on the surface of hMSCs.  These studies indicate that it will probably                not be possible to predict the likelihood that transplanted stem                cell preparations will trigger immune rejection processes  in                  vivo , solely on the basis of  in   vitro  experiments.                 The  in   vivo  environment encountered by transplanted                embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell preparations will likely contain                different concentrations of immunomodulatory molecules like ³-interferon                than are contained in the growth medium in a petri dish.                  Case Study: Stem cells in the future treatment of Type-1 Diabetes?                                  The human body requires glucose for cell energy, central nervous                system functioning, and other critical tasks. Glucose is produced                by the liver and generated from dietary carbohydrates. A protein                hormone called insulin, produced by the beta cells in the islets                of Langerhans of the pancreas, regulates the use of glucose by the                body and the amount of glucose in the blood.                  Type-1A diabetes is caused by a known  autoimmune  response.                Up to 90% of cases of type-1 diabetes are type-1A.  Other forms                of type-1 diabetes include Type-1B (idiopathic, or of unknown origin),                and latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA).  People with                type-1A diabetes have little to no insulin production because the                islet beta cells of their pancreas have been damaged by their own                immune system. They have a type of self-allergy that causes the                T lymphocytes of the immune system to attack their pancreatic beta                cells as if they were a foreign invader. Eventually, this results                in the destruction of most or all of the insulin-producing pancreatic                beta cells.                 When insufficient insulin is produced because the beta cells of                the pancreas have been destroyed, tight regulation of blood glucose                concentrations is lost.  Abnormally high blood glucose concentrations                result in modification of cellular proteins and pathologic changes                in blood vessels, degeneration of the retina, and kidney failure.                 Abnormally low blood glucose concentrations can lead to diabetic                coma and death in severe, untreated cases.                 Type-1 diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that currently                affects an estimated 550,000-1,110,000 Americans 35 .                 As such, it exacts a significant burden on the US healthcare system                and economy as a whole, over and above the drastic quality-of-life                reductions that are borne by its individual sufferers. Recent estimates                suggest that treatment of all forms of diabetes cost Americans a                total of $132 billion per year 36 .                 Since Type-1 diabetes comprises roughly 5-10% of all diabetes cases,                its costs can be estimated as $6.5 – $13 billion per year.                Current therapy choices and outcomes     Measuring blood                glucose and injecting human insulin preparations several times a                day is the current treatment for type-1 diabetes.  Although this                treatment is life prolonging for type-1 diabetics, its procedures                are painful and in many cases they do not result in adequate control                of blood glucose concentrations.  Whole pancreas transplants can                essentially cure type-1 diabetes, but less than 2000 donor pancreases                become available for transplantation in the U.S. each year 37 ,                and they are primarily used to treat patients who also need a kidney                transplant.  Pancreas transplant patients have to continuously take                powerful drugs to suppress the immunological rejection of the transplanted                pancreas.                 Recently, a less intensive immunosuppressive treatment (the Edmonton                protocol),                 coupled with islet cell transplantation into the liver, has produced                encouraging responses                 in early clinical trials 38 .                 Expanded clinical trials of this procedure are currently underway.                 Also being evaluated are methods of slowing the autoimmune destruction                of beta cells in the pancreas that subsequently results in disease.                              Whole pancreas and islet cell transplants ameliorate Type-1 diabetes,                but there are insufficient quantities of these materials to treat                all Type-1 diabetics.  It is hopeful to think that, if human stem                cells could be induced to differentiate  in   vitro  into                functional pancreatic beta cells, this material limitation might                be overcome.  Of course, it would also be crucial to prevent immunological                destruction of the newly transplanted beta cells.                 Stem Cell Therapy for Type-1 Diabetes?     Initial experiments                in mice suggested that insulin-producing cells could be obtained                from stem cells following  in   vitro  differentiation 39 .                 Can this approach be extended to human stem cells?  In a recent                paper, Lechner and Habener provided a list of six criteria to define                a pancreas-derived cell that could be potentially useful in treatment                of Type-1 diabetes 40 .                 We have used these six criteria to facilitate assessment of the                current state of progress toward development of functional beta                cells that might eventually be tested in human Type-1 diabetes patients                (see Table 1, which summarizes the properties of human cells studied                by Abraham et al 41                 Zulewski et al 42 ,                Assady et al 43 ,                Zhao et al 44 ,                and Zalzman et al 45 ).                 The evidence for insulin synthesis in each paper is specifically                listed, since Rajagopal et al 46                 have shown that bovine insulin, taken up by human stem and differentiated                cells when they are grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine                serum, can be mistaken for human insulin synthesized by the human                cells.                     The results described in Table 1 indicate that cells derived from                some human stem cell preparations were able to reverse hyperglycemia                in mouse models of human diabetes 47 .                 Although these results are encouraging, the likely immune rejection                of the transplanted human cells was prevented in these experiments                by using immunodeficient (SCID) mice.   Because most cases of Type-1                diabetes are caused by immune destruction of the pancreatic beta                cells, prospective new cell transplantation therapies for Type-1                diabetes will also need to assess whether there is rapid or chronic                immune reaction to the transplanted cells.  It will be important                to determine whether the candidate human beta-like cells express                MHC class I and class II antigens  in   vitro  and in                vivo in animal models of diabetes.  The studies described in Table                1 did not address this point.                   In addition, although no tumors were observed in the transplanted                mice, the experiments were terminated after about 2 months, so there                was a very limited time for tumor development to occur.  Because                many Type-1 diabetes patients are children and there is a currently                effective therapy, there will need to be a high degree of certainty                that any cells transplanted into such patients will not become malignant                over the course of their lives.  This means that stringent tests                of the tumorigenic potential of candidate cell preparations for                Type-1 diabetes treatment will be required.  These tests will need                to include multi-year studies in longer-lived animals than mice                or rats.  Long-term follow-up of children and adult patients who                received whole bone marrow transplants years ago has revealed an                increased risk of severe neurologic complications 48 and                a variety of types of cancer 49 .                             Therapeutic applications of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)                   Before stem cell-based therapies are used to treat human diseases,                they will have to gain approval through the FDA regulatory process.                 The first step in this process is filing an Investigational New                Drug Exemption (IND) application.  As of July 2003 four IND applications                have been filed for clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells.                 The disease indications include: 1) providing MSC support for peripheral                blood stem cell transplantation in cancer treatment, 2) providing                MSC support for cord blood transplantation in cancer treatment,                3) using MSCs to stimulate regeneration of cardiac tissue post acute                myocardial infarction (heart attack), and 4) using MSCs to stimulate                regeneration of cardiac tissue in cases of congestive heart failure.                 Each of the first two applications is currently in Phase II of the                regulatory process, with pivotal Phase III trials scheduled to begin                in 2004 50 .

Clonally isolated or marked cells are thought to provide a well-characterized,                  and thus consistent, source of cells for replicable tissue engineering.                  Of interest, the ES cell line used by Assady et al (the H9 stem                  cell line) is approved for federal funding under NIH guidelines.                  ß-cell-specific markers include: PDX-1 (a.k.a. IPF-1), a                  regulatory gene that has been shown to be important for pancreatic                  ß-cell function; glucokinase (GK), a gene encoding an enzyme                  that is largely responsible for detecting high levels of glucose                  and modulating insulin release in the pancreas; GLUT-2, a gene                  associated with glucose-responsive insulin secretion; and CK19,                  a marker for pancreatic ducts. Insulin production was judged by                  a number of criteria: synthesis of the messenger RNA for insulin,                  or its precursor, preproinsulin; tests for the presence of insulin                  protein itself; and ultrastructural studies (like electron microscopy)                  to determine whether insulin was present in secretory granuoles,                  which would suggest its intracellular production. In addition,                  the glucose-responsiveness of insulin-producing stem cell derivatives                  was assessed in a number of the studies described above and is                  considered an essential characteristic of normal pancreatic ß-cell                  function.                                    Two mouse models of Type-1 Diabetes were used in the  in vivo                   studies referenced above. Both used mice that had a condition                  known as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and that were                  treated with streptozoticin (STZ), a drug that induces destruction                  of insulin-producing cells. The mice in the Zalzman study were                  also born with a form of mouse diabetes, and are called Non-Obese                  Diabetic (NOD) mice. Hyperglycemia refers to high levels of blood                  sugar (glucose) seen in patients unable to synthesize insulin.                             Embryonic stem cell-based therapies for human diseases do not appear                to have progressed as far toward human clinical application as have                therapies based on MSCs.  As of July 2003, no IND applications had                been filed for clinical trials of embryonic stem cell-based therapies.                 A possible candidate for the first clinical application with these                cells is using oligodendrocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic                stem cells to treat cases of spinal cord injury (Keirstad, H., personal                communication).  An IND application may be filed for this indication                in late 2004 or 2005 51 .                             Conclusions     While it might be argued that it                is too soon to attempt to draw  any  conclusions about the                state of a field that is changing as rapidly as stem cell research,                it may be useful to attempt to draw some preliminary conclusions                regarding the current state of the field.                                 Human stem cell preparations can be reproducibly isolated from                  a variety of embryonic, fetal and adult tissue sources.                                                Some human stem cell preparations (e.g. hESCs, hEGs, hMSCs                  and MAPCs) can be reproducibly expanded to substantially larger                  cell numbers  in   vitro , the cells can be stored frozen                  and recovered, and they can be characterized and compared by a                  variety of techniques.  These cells are receiving a large share                  of the attention regarding possible future non-hematopoietic stem                  cell transplantation therapies.                                               hESC, hEGC, hMSC and MAPC preparations can be induced to differentiate                   in   vitro  into cells with properties similar to those                  of cells in differentiated tissues.                                               Research using these human stem cell preparations holds promise                  for a) increased understanding of the basic molecular process                  underlying cell differentiation, b) increased understanding of                  the early stages of genetic diseases and possibly cancer, and                  c) future cell transplantation therapies for human diseases.                                               The case study of developing stem cell-based therapies for                  Type-1 diabetes illustrates that, although insulin-producing cells                  have been made, we could still have a long way to go before stem                  cell-based therapies are developed for this disease.  This appears                  to be true irrespective of whether one starts from human embryonic                  stem cells or from human adult stem cells.                                               Human mesenchymal stem cell preparations are currently being                  evaluated in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for several                  specific diseases.                              _________________               Footnotes                                                     i.                      In   vivo , the cells that give rise to all the differentiated                    cells in the adult body comprise the inner cell mass (ICM) of                    the embryo at the blastocyst stage.   In   vitro ,                    cells originally isolated from the inner cell mass can, under                    appropriate growth conditions, become embryonic stem cell (ESC)                    preparations.   It is not yet clear that the ESCs that survive                    the  in   vitro  selection process to become ESC preparations                    have all the same biological properties and potentials as the                    ICM cells of the blastocyst [see (4)].  Although it is not known                    for certain that ESC preparations can give rise to  all                     the different cell types of the adult body, they have been shown                    to give rise to a substantial number [see (5)].                                                       ii.                     The terms “stromal stem cells”, “mesenchymal stem cells”, and                    “mesenchymal progenitor cells” have all been used by different                    authors to describe these cells.                                                       iii.

In vitro differentiation to a fully functional                    beta cell should be unequivocally established.  Insulin expression                    per se does not make a particular cell a beta cell.  The expression                    of other markers of beta cells (e.g. Pdx1/Ipf1, GLUT2, and glucokinase)                    or other endocrine islet cells should be demonstrated.                                                      Ultrastructural studies should confirm the                    formation of mature endocrine cells by identification of characteristic                    insulin secretory granules.                                                      The in vitro function of endocrine cells,                    differentiated from stem cells, should be reminiscent of the                    natural counterparts.  For beta cells, this would imply a significant                    glucose-responsive insulin secretion, adequate responses to                    incretin hormones and secretagogues, and the expected electrophysiological                    properties.                                                      In vivo studies in diabetic animals should                    demonstrate a reproducible and durable effect of the stem/progenitor-derived                    tissue on the attenuation of the diabetic phenotype.  It should                    also be demonstrated that removal of the stem cell-derived graft                    after a certain period of time leads to reappearance of the                    diabetes.                                                      For future clinical use, the tumorigenicity                    of stem/progenitor tissue should be determined. Additionally,                    immune responses toward the transplanted cells should be examined.                                                                                    41.
