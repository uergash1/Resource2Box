(we're all war-minded right now, you know. it's easy for the media to distract us by throwing us into our own verbal wars here at home.) ) what to do, what to do.... the rest of the public is given an animation of rick warren... and then my wife meets the man behind the projections, the quotes, the ""OTHER SIDE"". and he is warm, caring, effusive, and LOVES gays.""    -- Melissa Etheridge's wife, Tammy Lynn Michaels, blogging about Melissa's phone call and subsequent  meeting with Rick Warren  over the weekend.

If Warren loves gays, why does he say we need to 'repent' of our 'homosexual sin' in order to become members and serve in his church? This baffles me.    Happy Holidays,    EP                  Existential Punk  |  December 22, 2008 11:28 AM Reply to this comment                               Melissa has a Xmas album out and Rick Warren said he loved it.  All his sheep people at Saddleback will like to buy it also.  Melissa melted. I don't have anything to sell so I am not giving him any slack.  The policy of the Saddleback church is to not accept any openly LGBT's as members.  Melissa and her wife can attend as guests only.

They didn't get married, remember?  They had the same chance the rest of us did, they didn't do it.  I did.  I have a wife, I have a marriage.  They have neither and so forgive me if I ask both of them to shut the hell up as spokespeople for married gay folk like me.    The words may not matter to some people (like Michaels', who said on Oprah following Prop 8's passage that if the word 'marriage' is such a big deal, we should just take a 'civil union' instead) --but for me , the words do matter -- and they certainly matter to Rick Warren and his ilk.    It's not hard to see why we continue to have our asses handed to us by these people (elitists on left, evangelicals on the right, politicians everywhere), when all it takes is a hug and an autograph to sell our dignity, and the dignity of fellow LGBT people down the river--oh yeah, that's all it took, read the whole post people.                      Jennifer  |  December 22, 2008  4:17 PM Reply to this comment                               I feel obliged to point out that if you visit Tammy's blog, you'll see that she's  not  a big fan of making nice with Warren.  I believe the word she used to describe him was ""Dick.""    I added her blog to my RSS feed.  She's rather spunky and funny in her writing.                      Bil Browning  |  December 22, 2008  4:26 PM Reply to this comment                               Do Obama and Etheridge know that we can't all meet the man? And he could just be putting on a mask for them.    This post gives me a headache. If Warren is such a great intelligent guy he  KNOWS  that civil marriage is different from religious marriage. And Tammy's analogy of caps and yarmulkes  should  be referring to the differences between civil and religious marriage, not civil marriage and civil unions.                  Eric |  December 22, 2008  4:39 PM Reply to this comment                               So did Melissa get Warren to dump the language on his SaddlebackFamily.com website concerning gays?   This page:   http://www.saddlebackfamily.com/membership/group_finder/faqs_smallgroup.asp?id=7509  Which said, among other things:   Because membership in a church is an outgrowth of accepting the Lordship and leadership of Jesus in ones life,  someone unwilling to repent of their homosexual lifestyle would not be accepted as a member at Saddleback Church . That does not mean they cannot attend church  we hope they do! Gods Word has the power to change our lives.  Is no longer on the site.                      Lynn David |  December 23, 2008  1:45 AM Reply to this comment                               I feel pretty betrayed by this, actually. Melissa Etheridge is, of course, entitled to her own personal opinion (as is Warren), but to presume to tell the LGBTQ community to not be angry with Warren and reach out  to him  is insulting to my intelligence, integrity and sense of personal dignity. Etheridge admits herself that she knew very little about Warren before the inauguration kerfuffle, but yet she feels she now has the authority to say he's just been misunderstood and actually ""loves"" gays and believes in equal rights for LGBTQ folks? Highly doubtful. I think he flattered her and now can use her as his token gay ""friend"" (as in, ""I'm not a bigot. Look I have gay friends,"" and we all know that when you say that you really must not be a bigot, when you need to qualify it like that). Argh.                  fourthwave  |  December 23, 2008 10:16 PM Reply to this comment                                           Leave a comment     To help avoid spam, all comments from unregistered users are held for moderation.

We have spent a long time climbing up this mountain, looking at the impossible, changing a thousand year-old paradigm. We have asked for the right to love the human of our choice, and to be protected equally under the laws of this great country. The road at times has been so bloody, and so horrible, and so disheartening. From being blamed for 9/11 and Katrina, to hateful crimes committed against us, we are battle weary. We watched as our nation took a step in the right direction, against all odds and elected Barack Obama as our next leader. Then we were jerked back into the last century as we watched our rights taken away by prop 8 in California. Still sore and angry we felt another slap in the face as the man we helped get elected seemingly invited a gay-hater to address the world at his inauguration.     I hadn't heard of Pastor Rick Warren before all of this. When I heard the news, in its neat little sound bite form that we are so accustomed to, it painted the picture for me. This Pastor Rick must surely be one hate spouting, money grabbing, bad hair televangelist like all the others. He probably has his own gay little secret bathroom stall somewhere, you know. One more hater working up his congregation to hate the gays, comparing us to pedophiles and those who commit incest, blah blah blah. Same 'ole thing. Would I be boycotting the inauguration? Would we be marching again?    Well, I have to tell you my friends, the universe has a sense of humor and indeed works in mysterious ways. As I was winding down the promotion for my Christmas album I had one more stop last night. I'd agreed to play a song I'd written with my friend Salman Ahmed, a Sufi Muslim from Pakistan. The song is called ""Ring The Bells,"" and it's a call for peace and unity in our world. We were going to perform our song for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a group of Muslim Americans that tries to raise awareness in this country, and the world, about the majority of good, loving, Muslims. I was honored, considering some in the Muslim religion consider singing to be against God, while other Muslim countries have harsh penalties, even death for homosexuals. I felt it was a very brave gesture for them to make. I received a call the day before to inform me of the keynote speaker that night... Pastor Rick Warren. I was stunned. My fight or flight instinct took over, should I cancel? Then a calm voice inside me said, ""Are you really about peace or not?""     I told my manager to reach out to Pastor Warren and say ""In the spirit of unity I would like to talk to him."" They gave him my phone number. On the day of the conference I received a call from Pastor Rick, and before I could say anything, he told me what a fan he was. He had most of my albums from the very first one. What? This didn't sound like a gay hater, much less a preacher. He explained in very thoughtful words that as a Christian he believed in equal rights for everyone. He believed every loving relationship should have equal protection. He struggled with proposition 8 because he didn't want to see marriage redefined as anything other than between a man and a woman. He said he regretted his choice of words in his video message to his congregation about proposition 8 when he mentioned pedophiles and those who commit incest. He said that in no way, is that how he thought about gays. He invited me to his church, I invited him to my home to meet my wife and kids. He told me of his wife's struggle with breast cancer just a year before mine.     When we met later that night, he entered the room with open arms and an open heart. We agreed to build bridges to the future.      Brothers and sisters the choice is ours now. We have the world's attention. We have the capability to create change, awesome change in this world, but before we change minds we must change hearts. Sure, there are plenty of hateful people who will always hold on to their bigotry like a child to a blanket. But there are also good people out there, Christian and otherwise that are beginning to listen. They don't hate us, they fear change. Maybe in our anger, as we consider marches and boycotts, perhaps we can consider stretching out our hands. Maybe instead of marching on his church, we can show up en mass and volunteer for one of the many organizations affiliated with his church that work for HIV/AIDS causes all around the world.     Maybe if they get to know us, they wont fear us.    I know, call me a dreamer, but I feel a new era is upon us.     I will be attending the inauguration with my family, and with hope in my heart. I know we are headed in the direction of marriage equality and equal protection for all families.      Happy Holidays my friends and a Happy New Year to you.    Peace on earth, goodwill toward all men and women... and everyone in-between.

I was listening when you called her to let her know about Warren and I could feel the emotions that you were fighting with. I am so proud of you for having the courage to do the ""hard"" thing and meet with this man. He needs to understand the responsibility he has and that what he says and how he says it affects not only his followers, but all of us! But the thing that struck me about the whole thing is the fact that in your determination to do what your heart told you to do, you not only opened a door and passed through it with Warren, you performed, on stage, as a woman at a Muslim gathering and you opened more doors and hearts with that performance than many Muslim women could have hoped for. In a wonderful twist of fate you chosing to do the hard thing turned out to benefit more people than you know. You are an amazing woman, and although you don't deserve the backlash you're getting in some of these posts, I know you understand that there are millions of us cheering you on and we know that moving forward is always in small steps. Keep the faith, love and happy new year to you and your family and we look forward to seeing you at the inauguration.                                                                                                                                               Reply                                                                    Favorite                                   Flag as abusive                                                                     Posted 03:01 AM on 01/10/2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                     +                                                                                                        1of1800  See Profile   I'm a Fan of 1of1800          I'm a fan of this user                                          permalink                                                                                                                                                                                        Melissa,    As you, I am one of 1800 same sex couples who took advantage of the opportunity to be married in CA. I chose to have a confidential ceremony with no witnesses which is also not public record. My partner of 31 years and I have an ""invisible"" marriage. Why did we do it that way? Because of 31 years of living in the majority heterosexual world wherein besides our best efforts to let people ""just get to know us"", it resulted in only a few friendly neighbors and mostly not. We own our own business and home, vote and pay our taxes. We are, by all measures, productive members of society. But, Melissa, we would not have been so eager to believe Pastor Warren's epiphany which he shared with you. Remember, actions speak louder than words. Only time will tell if he really is serious about bridging our community's differences. He has a golden moment during his inaugural invocation to offer an olive branch.

Warren and his ilk cannot be trusted to change. Why is it always the group that is being oppressed is seen as the one that should turn the other check and be nice and understand and beg for understanding by the unenlightened? I am one gay person who wants Obama,  Warren and all the anti-gay, homophobic Americans to provide us not with special rights, but equal rights. Militant? Yes. Unapologetic?  Yes. I am not a second-class citizen -- I want those who choose to discriminate to show some understanding. I am tired of being treated unfairly. I demand my rights. All gays should demand their rights. I have no faith that honey will be more successful than vinegar in our quest for equal rights.                                                                                                                                               Reply                                                                    Favorite                                   Flag as abusive                                                                     Posted 10:02 PM on 01/09/2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                     +                                                                                                        Meesha  See Profile   I'm a Fan of Meesha          I'm a fan of this user                                          permalink                                                                                                                                                                                        A new ERA is upon us.

Fresh off his Golden Globe-nominated turn as a faux airline pilot in Steven Spielberg's cat-and-mouse caper Catch Me If You Can, the 28-year-old actor will next portray Howard Hughes in the big-budget biopic The Aviator.

With shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Cheers ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Will & Grace ,  Mad About You ,  Frasier , and  Friends , NBC dominated the ratings during the competitive Thursday night prime time timeslots.             Contents       1   Usage   2   Advertising   3   Decline   4   NBC Thursday-night lineup history   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Usage   In popular culture the phrase is most strongly associated with the network's entire Thursday night lineup, including both sitcoms and dramas, which dominated the ratings from the 1980s through late 1990s. Over the course of two decades, NBC's Thursday lineup featured such popular shows as  Hill Street Blues ,  The Cosby Show ,  Family Ties ,  Cheers ,  A Different World ,  Wings ,  Night Court ,  L.A. Law ,  Frasier ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Friends , and  Will & Grace .   However, contrary to popular belief, ""Must See TV"" originally applied to sitcoms only (dramas would normally be promoted separately), and for much of the 1990s the phrase was used several nights a week as an attempt at  brand extension . At one point in fall 1997, the brand was used five nights a week, with four sitcoms a night from Monday to Thursday, and two on Sunday. [ 1 ]  NBC itself would later adopt the more common interpretation; the 2002 retrospective,  20 Years of Must See TV , focused on NBC's overall Thursday-night dominance from 1982 onwards, and overlooked extensions such as ""Must See TV Tuesday"".   However, the popularity of NBC's ""Must See TV"" in the 1990s was not universal. Many  African American  viewers flocked to  FOX 's Thursday night line-up of  Living Single ,  New York Undercover , and  Martin . In fact, these were the three highest rated series among Black households (in this respective order) for the 1996-1997 season. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Advertising   Thursday nights are coveted by advertisers due to the large proportion of young, affluent viewers who tune in. Of particular interest, movie advertisers promote their titles to this target demographic on Thursday night, in hopes of influencing what movies they see on the following Friday night, the traditional opening night for most films outside of holiday periods. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Decline          From a promo for ""Comedy Night Done Right"" in October 2007. The image features [From Left]  Earl Hickey  (Of  My Name Is Earl ),  Michael Scott  (Of  The Office ),  John Dorian  (Of  Scrubs ) and  Liz Lemon  (Of  30 Rock ).       By the early 2000s, the ""Must See TV"" slogan had fallen by the wayside in NBC's promotions; more importantly, NBC had gone from the top-rated network on Thursday nights to second behind CBS, and eventually third behind ABC. Some of the reasons for NBC's failure in recent years on Thursdays was due to the lack of strong shows to replace staples such as  Friends ,  Frasier  and  Seinfeld . Another reason was due to the  Donald Trump  reality series  The Apprentice , which broke the traditional ""Must See TV"" line up containing four comedies and one drama when it debuted in winter 2004. However, most of the  NBC  lineup still finished in the top 20 weekly shows according to  Nielsen Media Research . [ 4 ]   Other networks' Thursday programming has also gotten increasingly stronger.  CBS  was first to break through with the Thursday-night schedule of  Survivor ,  CSI , and later  Without a Trace .  ABC  had success on Thursday nights with its hit  reality  series,  Dancing with the Stars .  In fall 2006,  Grey's Anatomy  was moved to Thursdays to counter  CSI ; ABC's lineup of  Ugly Betty  and  Grey's Anatomy  has proved successful in the 18-49-year-old demographic.   The ""Must See TV"" slogan reappeared briefly in early 2006 with the addition of two critically acclaimed and ratings-successful comedies,  My Name Is Earl  and  The Office . This was an attempt to re-establish a four-sitcom block after the rise and fall of  The Apprentice , which was moved to Monday nights.   In November 2006, NBC rebranded the Thursday format with a new different slogan, ""Comedy Night Done Right"", and added  Scrubs  and  30 Rock  to the lineup, forming an entire lineup without  laugh tracks  or the  multiple-camera setup  typical of past Must See TV comedies.

And I was reminded of why that show set everyone on their ear 14 years ago. Why the so-called ""war of the hospital shows"" turned quickly into a rout, with ""ER"" becoming the No. 1 show in television and ""Chicago Hope"" turning into a soap opera occasionally punctuated by Mandy Patinkin bursting into song.                        As I stood in the trauma unit of County General Hospital on the Warner studio lot, and as I reflected on the battered drop ceiling and screened flourescent lighting and carefully arranged hospital gear and bedding, I was reminded of nothing so much as my one night in a real-life Chicago emergency room; of a bright-eyed young M.D. walking in and doing instant triage with a dozen or so of us arranged in a semi-circle; of waiting my turn on a gurney that smelled of pee while the guy with the bloody gauze around his head and other injured souls took precedence over my  bread-knife wound; and of realizing there is nothing more democratic in this country than trauma care (this was before I knew anything about the uninsured).    ""ER"" was a revelation. The doctors on the show were handsome, and they inevitably fell in and out of love with each other, and they saved lives and all those things TV docs are supposed to do. But they also seemed like real doctors in the way they responded to each new case that came bursting into their sanctuary of work. That's why I was pleased to learn recently that Anthony Edwards, whose Dr Mark Greene tried never to let his emotions show, whose competence felt hard-earned and not given to him by the script gods, will make an appearance this season. (To those partial to Noah Wyle, you already know he is coming back because you saw the commercial all summer.)    Even through the hostage dramas and multiple explosions (including the one that ended season 14 in a cliffhanger) and other absurdities, ""ER"" never stopped trying to recreate the authenticity of being a patient, sick and fearful in a room full of strangers; or of being a doctor, being professional under fire, sardonically swapping stories with colleagues, dealing with incompetent and malicious higher-ups and doing things to kill the pain of not saving the world.    In a way, though, ""ER"" got stuck in the era of '90s television that it dominated. With rare exceptions (like the episode where Ray Liotta played a dying alcoholic), its patient seemed less true-to-life, the situations more outlandish, the doctors more like TV doctors.     TV shows became more complex and ambitious. ""ER"" was supplanted as the top-rated medical drama by ""House,"" a show that combines a disease whodunit of the week with a preternaturally smart solver who has the pathologies of any 10 doctors on ""ER"" combined. (Tellingly, an ""ER"" last April smacked of a ""House"" ripoff, with a hidden secret revealing a moral dilemma linked to a fatal ailment.)    And then there was reality TV. From ""Trauma in the ER"" to this summer's surprise hit ""Hopkins,"" lightweight cameras and microphones have allowed TV crews to document all the drama and emotion of actual ERs without those pesky writers and actors. The ratings for reality medical shows can't match ""ER"" at its peak, but then again, what show ever will? The point is, the realism of these unscripted shows made the scripted one  seem contrived and hokey.    ""ER's"" strong suit remains the romance of medics under fire, such as the darling attraction of opposites Tony (John Stamos) and Sam (Linda Cardellini). Cast changes will continue, with the arrival of Angela Bassett as a tough-minded administrator (Courtney B. Vance will play her husband) adding even more interest to what will likely be a parade of guest appearances by ""ER"" alumni all season long.    And truth be told, its ratings are doing just fine.  That's not what killed ""ER.""  It's suffering from the chronic problems of an old TV show: bloated production costs and a lack of attention. (More than one person, on hearing I was working on this story, said, ""'ER' is still on the air?"") The show's executive producer John Wells, sitting in a director's chair on the set, told me that NBC is paying three and a half times for his show what it would be paying for a new seris.  So even if two out of three of the new ones flopped, the network's still ahead if it gets rid of ""ER.""     And yet, said the producer of ""Third Watch"" and ""West Wing,"" ""I've never had a show cancelled where the network didn't come back a year later and say, 'We shouldn't have cancelled that show.'""

That show gave NBC its only saving grace on Friday nights and was still doing all right ratings wise when nbc decided to call it a day. at least they got to make a satisfying finale though. ah i always liked that show. it was better acted then it was ever given credit for being.

""You know, I have yet to meet a person who says they wish they spent less time with their kids when they were younger,"" says Edwards, who nonetheless will make one final appearance on  ER  Thursday (Nov. 13) as part of the NBC show's farewell season. ""And I'm really lucky that I have that opportunity. So it's going to be a few more years before my kids are really, really sick of me and want me gone. So when I get the final, 'You really have to go back to work,' then my mind will be a little more open to that.""    For now, though, Edwards has a production deal at CBS -- where he's developing a script with  30 Rock   writer Jack Burditt -- the occasional film role (most recently in last year's  Zodiac ) and dad duties with his four kids, ranging in age from 6 to 14, to keep him busy. ""I've been working as an actor since I was 16, so when I hit 40, I was OK about leaving and not doing as much for a while,"" he says. ""I didn't have that, 'What's the next movie?' [impulse] that I'd had for 24 years before, you know? So that was part of it. I think hopefully a little maturity and some moolah.""    Edwards has also thrown himself into philanthropic work since leaving  ER . He's currently working with a group called  Shoe4Africa  to help build a 250-bed children's hospital in Kenya, and he says part of his motivation for appearing in the episode was the chance to promote the cause.     He's also putting his money where his mouth is. Instead of being paid for his guest spot, Edwards asked  ER  producer Warner Bros. to donate $125,000 to the charity, which has since snowballed: ""Steven Spielberg found out about [it] and he matched, and [ ER  executive producer] John Wells kicked in $50,000,"" he says.      As for Thursday's episode, Edwards appears in a series of flashbacks that connect County General's newest attending physician, Dr. Cate Banfield ( Angela Bassett ) with Mark Greene's time. The scenes are set near the end of Greene's time at the hospital -- when he's undergoing treatment for the cancer that eventually caused his death -- and feature several other former  ER  regulars as well (whose identities we won't spoil here).    ""After about half an hour it really felt like I'd never left,"" Edwards says. ""The same conversations were happening that were happening six years ago, the same dynamics between the crew members, the same jokes. And they had gone to great effort to make it look like it did [six years ago] -- you know, when I look at the show now I see how different the ER looks than when I was on it. And they went to great effort to have all the props, everything back to 2002. So it was really -- I had a really great four days there.""    More from Edwards about his  ER  swan song:    On the decision to return:  ""It sounds kind of silly, but I mean, I really did have eight really good years on the show, and so much of that is about trust. And I'd had 180 episodes of trust, knowing that they were going to do interesting stories, and they always did.    ""So I really wasn't -- I knew they would take care of him and take care of it. ... It's a funny thing. You feel as an actor that you own the character, but the truth is so do the writers. The writers really feel an ownership of Greene, so they want to do right for him. So there's actually more people looking out for you than yourself in the end.""    On the ease of revisiting the character:  ""When you do a series and you do television like that for so many years, so much of the character is similar to yourself. Writers pick up on things that you do that they add to the character. So, you know, I'm not as -- I'll never be as smart as Dr. Greene, but there's a lot of familiarity in who he is.    ""So I think that bottom line thing that I always cared the most about him was there, which is that he really loved being a doctor. That's not a hard thing to jump back into.""    On  ER 's place in television history:  ""I think it's one of those  Gunsmoke s of TV. ... In its heyday, the numbers and the world that it had.     ""I just was in my attic the other day and had all these boxes that had been sent to L.A., and it was full of all these covers of -- magazine covers and things, a ton. And you forget -- [it was] like, Wow, there was a time when we were on the cover of  Newsweek . And so, you know, hopefully you'll think of it as  M*A*S*H . That would be the perfect thing.""    Are you excited to see Edwards return to the  ER ? Which other former cast members do you want to see return?                 in                     ER                       ,                 Interviews                                Permalink     Comments (10)                     Comments               I can't wait to see Dr. Greene back. I'd love to see his wife Dr. Corday back too, but I heard there is bad blood with the producers. Carter's coming back at some point, so I guess Dr. Chen, and Dr. Pratt would be great to see.     Alan | Nov 11, 2008 1:40:22 PM |  #                  There was a time that ER was my favorite show.  After a time, I was getting closer and closer to letting the show go, and the death of Dr. Greene was the natural end of the series for me.  I haven't watched an episode since.  I probably will watch this one, however, since Dr. Greene is back, and I missed the show for the first time in a long time when I heard the news that Michael Crichton died.  It will be like a nice memory shared one last time and a proper way to acknowledge everything the show did mean to me at one point even though I haven't paid attention to it in quite some time.      Josh Man  | Nov 11, 2008 2:09:14 PM |  #                  ER was one of the best--at one time.  Anthony Edwards was in my opinion( with Noah Wylie)the true stars of the show and after that powerful episode in which Dr. Greene eventually succumbed to his cancer it was almost like the beginning of the end for the show.  Then when Dr. Carter finally left it really should have concluded.  There have been some good, even some very good episodes since then with Pratt, Morris, Abby and others doing a decent job.  BUT....it really was not the same after Edwards and Carter and even Ross and Hathaway and Benton left.  I do like how they are bringing back most of the earlier characters though.     G | Nov 11, 2008 11:20:00 PM |  #                  I was a recurring extra on the show back in the 90s when most of the original cast was still there. Tony is truly a class act and it's great to see him back.     When ER debuted in 1994 I was a Sophomore in High School. Now I'm 31 and have a career. I've always been a fan of the show and I can say that I've seen every episode from day 1. There have been some middle of the road episodes and some bumps in the road. You can't expect that there wouldn't be for a show that has run 15 seasons.     What I love about the show is that it has always stayed true to what it is: A medical drama driven by stories and the characters who tell them.     One of my first ""real"" jobs out of college was working as a computer tech in a hospital. One of the things ER has so accurately represented over the years is its portrayal of a real hospital. I know this evolved out of actor's contracts and schedule changes, but I found that much like the TV ER, Nurses are the constant, some working there for over 20 years, while all the doctors come and go.     I am sad to see ER go. Grey's Anatomy can only hope to be half the show ER was.      Soul Reaper | Nov 12, 2008 12:33:45 AM |  #                  I want to rub myself all over Dr. Green. Deelicious!     Mel | Nov 12, 2008 7:19:22 AM |  #                  I finally gave up on ER during the season following Noah Wyle's Doctor Carter's departure from the show.  Without his presence grounding things back to the days of greatness I remembered, I no longer cared about it.  It's characters had become very card board and very boring and uninteresting.  AE's return as Dr. Greene will see me watch once again for the first time since the shows true series finale, when Wyle/Carter left the show.  I might tune in for the series finale as well, but doubt it will be as good as seeing Greene again.  The show should have been canceled years ago, I fear.  I said such years ago as well.  Not every show has the Law & Order ability to survive the cast transitions it's endured.  Even the original Law & Order almost died these past few years from it, only last year with a 13-episode half-season reviving itself (finally) once more.  It's often better to go out on top than to wait and fizzle away.     Doug | Nov 12, 2008 8:45:40 AM |  #                  Hey Doug...L&O had a full season last year (18 eps due to the writer's strike)...just an fyi     Deep Throat | Nov 13, 2008 12:10:32 AM |  #                  I am soooooooooo excited about Dr. Greene being back on ER tonight.  I've stayed with ER thru the years even after the original characters had all gone.  They did what a lot of shows don't do when introducing new characters...they would show them with the veteran characters for a long enough time to make us care about them so when a vet left, it wasn't so jarring.  It has changed a lot, but it's still a good show & worth watching.  I usually record it & watch it later, but I think I'll watch it live tonight.     DG | Nov 13, 2008 5:00:55 AM |  #                  I will miss ER so much. It's been my favourite show for so long now. To all of the people that quit watching after ""this one"" or ""that one"" left, you have missed so much good tv! The characters have changed over time, but the drama and story lines have continued to be the best on tv! I will truly miss it!     Dizzy | Nov 13, 2008 10:54:41 AM |  #                  I will also miss ER a lot when it is gone.  Yes, I'd gotten attached to different characters, but others came in that brought a different dimension to the show.  As much as I loved some of the departed characters, I think the series would have gotten stale if all the same people had been there the entire run.    I've watched the episode with Anthony Edwards in the flashbacks as Dr. Greene, and I have to say that in my opinion it was excellent.  And I liked it that Eriq La Salle (Dr. Benton) was the one who did the intro about the death of Michael Crichton.  When I saw that I was wondering if Dr. Benton was going to be one of the cameos in the show, but he wasn't.

With shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Cheers ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Will & Grace ,  Mad About You ,  Frasier , and  Friends , NBC dominated the ratings during the competitive Thursday night prime time timeslots.             Contents       1   Usage   2   Advertising   3   Decline   4   NBC Thursday-night lineup history   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Usage   In popular culture the phrase is most strongly associated with the network's entire Thursday night lineup, including both sitcoms and dramas, which dominated the ratings from the 1980s through late 1990s. Over the course of two decades, NBC's Thursday lineup featured such popular shows as  Friends ,  Hill Street Blues ,  The Cosby Show ,  Family Ties ,  Cheers ,  A Different World ,  Wings ,  Night Court ,  L.A. Law ,  Frasier ,  Seinfeld ,  ER  and  Will & Grace .   However, contrary to popular belief, ""Must See TV"" originally applied to sitcoms only (dramas would normally be promoted separately), and for much of the 1990s the phrase was used several nights a week as an attempt at  brand extension . At one point in fall 1997, the brand was used five nights a week, with four sitcoms a night from Monday to Thursday, and two on Sunday. [ 1 ]  NBC itself would later adopt the more common interpretation; the 2002 retrospective,  20 Years of Must See TV , focused on NBC's overall Thursday-night dominance from 1982 onwards, and overlooked extensions such as ""Must See TV Tuesday"".   However, the popularity of NBC's ""Must See TV"" in the 1990s was not universal. Many  African American  viewers flocked to  FOX 's Thursday night line-up of  Living Single ,  New York Undercover , and  Martin . In fact, these were the three highest rated series among Black households (in this respective order) for the 1996-1997 season. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Advertising   Thursday nights are coveted by advertisers due to the large proportion of young, affluent viewers who tune in. Of particular interest, movie advertisers promote their titles to this target demographic on Thursday night, in hopes of influencing what movies they see on the following Friday night, the traditional opening night for most films outside of holiday periods. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Decline          From a promo for ""Comedy Night Done Right"" in October 2007. The image features [From Left]  Earl Hickey  (Of  My Name Is Earl ),  Michael Scott  (Of  The Office ),  John Dorian  (Of  Scrubs ) and  Liz Lemon  (Of  30 Rock ).       By the early 2000s, the ""Must See TV"" slogan had fallen by the wayside in NBC's promotions; more importantly, NBC had gone from the top-rated network on Thursday nights to second behind CBS, and eventually third behind ABC. Some of the reasons for NBC's failure in recent years on Thursdays was due to the lack of strong shows to replace staples such as  Friends ,  Frasier  and  Seinfeld . Another reason was due to the  Donald Trump  reality series  The Apprentice , which broke the traditional ""Must See TV"" line up containing four comedies and one drama when it debuted in winter 2004. However, most of the  NBC  lineup still finished in the top 20 weekly shows according to  Nielsen Media Research . [ 4 ]   Other networks' Thursday programming has also gotten increasingly stronger.  CBS  was first to break through with the Thursday-night schedule of  Survivor ,  CSI , and later  Without a Trace .  ABC  had success on Thursday nights with its hit  reality  series,  Dancing with the Stars .  In fall 2006,  Grey's Anatomy  was moved to Thursdays to counter  CSI ; ABC's lineup of  Ugly Betty  and  Grey's Anatomy  has proved successful in the 18-49-year-old demographic.   The ""Must See TV"" slogan reappeared briefly in early 2006 with the addition of two critically acclaimed and ratings-successful comedies,  My Name Is Earl  and  The Office . This was an attempt to re-establish a four-sitcom block after the rise and fall of  The Apprentice , which was moved to Monday nights.   In November 2006, NBC rebranded the Thursday format with a new different slogan, ""Comedy Night Done Right"", and added  Scrubs  and  30 Rock  to the lineup, forming an entire lineup without  laugh tracks  or the  multiple-camera setup  typical of past Must See TV comedies.

With shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Cheers ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Will & Grace ,  Mad About You ,  Frasier , and  Friends , NBC dominated the ratings during the competitive Thursday night prime time timeslots.             Contents       1   Usage   2   Advertising   3   Decline   4   NBC Thursday-night lineup history   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Usage   In popular culture the phrase is most strongly associated with the network's entire Thursday night lineup, including both sitcoms and dramas, which dominated the ratings from the 1980s through late 1990s. Over the course of two decades, NBC's Thursday lineup featured such popular shows as  Friends ,  Hill Street Blues ,  The Cosby Show ,  Family Ties ,  Cheers ,  A Different World ,  Wings ,  Night Court ,  L.A. Law ,  Frasier ,  Seinfeld ,  ER  and  Will & Grace .   However, contrary to popular belief, ""Must See TV"" originally applied to sitcoms only (dramas would normally be promoted separately), and for much of the 1990s the phrase was used several nights a week as an attempt at  brand extension . At one point in fall 1997, the brand was used five nights a week, with four sitcoms a night from Monday to Thursday, and two on Sunday. [ 1 ]  NBC itself would later adopt the more common interpretation; the 2002 retrospective,  20 Years of Must See TV , focused on NBC's overall Thursday-night dominance from 1982 onwards, and overlooked extensions such as ""Must See TV Tuesday"".   However, the popularity of NBC's ""Must See TV"" in the 1990s was not universal. Many  African American  viewers flocked to  FOX 's Thursday night line-up of  Living Single ,  New York Undercover , and  Martin . In fact, these were the three highest rated series among Black households (in this respective order) for the 1996-1997 season. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Advertising   Thursday nights are coveted by advertisers due to the large proportion of young, affluent viewers who tune in. Of particular interest, movie advertisers promote their titles to this target demographic on Thursday night, in hopes of influencing what movies they see on the following Friday night, the traditional opening night for most films outside of holiday periods. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Decline          From a promo for ""Comedy Night Done Right"" in October 2007. The image features [From Left]  Earl Hickey  (Of  My Name Is Earl ),  Michael Scott  (Of  The Office ),  John Dorian  (Of  Scrubs ) and  Liz Lemon  (Of  30 Rock ).       By the early 2000s, the ""Must See TV"" slogan had fallen by the wayside in NBC's promotions; more importantly, NBC had gone from the top-rated network on Thursday nights to second behind CBS, and eventually third behind ABC. Some of the reasons for NBC's failure in recent years on Thursdays was due to the lack of strong shows to replace staples such as  Friends ,  Frasier  and  Seinfeld . Another reason was due to the  Donald Trump  reality series  The Apprentice , which broke the traditional ""Must See TV"" line up containing four comedies and one drama when it debuted in winter 2004. However, most of the  NBC  lineup still finished in the top 20 weekly shows according to  Nielsen Media Research . [ 4 ]   Other networks' Thursday programming has also gotten increasingly stronger.  CBS  was first to break through with the Thursday-night schedule of  Survivor ,  CSI , and later  Without a Trace .  ABC  had success on Thursday nights with its hit  reality  series,  Dancing with the Stars .  In fall 2006,  Grey's Anatomy  was moved to Thursdays to counter  CSI ; ABC's lineup of  Ugly Betty  and  Grey's Anatomy  has proved successful in the 18-49-year-old demographic.   The ""Must See TV"" slogan reappeared briefly in early 2006 with the addition of two critically acclaimed and ratings-successful comedies,  My Name Is Earl  and  The Office . This was an attempt to re-establish a four-sitcom block after the rise and fall of  The Apprentice , which was moved to Monday nights.   In November 2006, NBC rebranded the Thursday format with a new different slogan, ""Comedy Night Done Right"", and added  Scrubs  and  30 Rock  to the lineup, forming an entire lineup without  laugh tracks  or the  multiple-camera setup  typical of past Must See TV comedies.

My parents did a fantastic job. The way my father described it to me as a kid, being on television is a career choice. It's a way of working, and you want to do that with integrity, but everybody works. I think that his common sense wore off on me a little bit.   Did growing up as a child star help when your own kids wanted to get into the same field? Michael Weaver, HONOLULU   I have four kids. Two of them are acting professionally now, but my wife Cheryl and I wouldn't let any of them work as minors the way I had. What I told them was, ""If you love the business, then pursue it. But it's going to be your decision as an adult, not something that I decide for you when you're a minor.""   Do you miss The Andy Griffith Show or Happy Days more? Collin Kaiser, DENVER   I'm not a very nostalgic person, and I view the shows differently. When I think of my childhood, I think of The Andy Griffith Show. Happy Days was more like college or the Army, where those relationships are my first adult friendships. Both have important places in my heart, not to be corny about it.   Would you ever act again? David Malyn, SALT LAKE CITY   Every once in a while, somebody asks me if I would be in something. But at a certain point my wife said, ""We're raising four kids. If you're not pursuing acting as a career, please don't take jobs as a kind of lark. If you have a couple extra weeks, give them to us."" I thought that was a really fair request.   What was the most difficult part about making the transition from actor to director? Matthew Peterson HOT SPRINGS, ARK.   For me it was learning to not control everything. When you're directing, of course, you're supervising everything, but if you don't trust the artists you're collaborating with, you wind up tying one of their hands behind their back. My work got much, much better when I learned to let go a little bit.   Who do you feel is the best actor turned director, not including yourself? Ismail Atiev, TORONTO   Robert Redford's made some amazing movies. Eastwood is stupendous. Woody Allen is bold and artful. Ismail, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to say that I admire them all too much to be able to identify a single individual.   Is there going to be an Arrested Development film? Joe Matz, TUCSON, ARIZ.   I hope there's going to be an Arrested Development movie because there's this out-of-work narrator who just can't wait to get back to the microphone. If nothing else, just to get people to stop asking me about it.   One of the keys to Frost/Nixon is the interplay between Frank Langella and Michael Sheen. What made you believe no other actors could play the roles? Henrique Amaral, LONDON   Both have done so much to understand their characters, really from their souls. [When I saw them in the play] it became clear to me that anybody else was going to be walking in their shadows, and I really wanted film audiences to see what these actors could bring.   Was it hard for you to be objective toward the subject matter?

clueweb09-en0011-16-32118	         TV Jab                 Home      Archives      Network      Contact      About                                        ER creator Michael Crichton passes away   Posted by Drew as  ER  at 12:06 PM EST   06     NO  Comments                 Acclaimed author and creator of the long-running show ER passed away Tuesday, his family said, after a long, private battle with cancer.   Most famous for his novel Jurassic Park, he authored another two dozen, including The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Sphere, Disclosure, The Lost World, Timeline, Prey, State of Fear, and Next.  He was a strong voice in the scientific community, even going so far as to testify in front of a Congressional hearing on climate change, after the release of State of Fear, in which he questioned global warming.   On a personal note, Michael Crichton was easily my favorite author.  Jurassic Park was the first “big” novel that I read (I still remember that it was 399 pages), and I read through it at least 10 times.  He was likely the primary, major contributor to my love for fiction and storytelling.  My prayers are with the Crichton family.                    ‘ER’ may actually benefit from the WGA strike   Posted by Drew as  ER  at 8:04 PM EST   05     NO  Comments                 Despite all the doom and gloom that is bouncing around out there due to this writers strike, some shows may actually benefit.   Kristin at  eOnline  is saying that  ER ’s producers are concerned that they will not have time to wrap up all the storylines in this final chapter of the medical drama if the walkout lasts too long.  If that is the case, NBC may be forced to bring them back for a 15th season, albeit a shortened one, possible, to tie up all the loose ends.   See?  It’s not all bad.                    What’s On - Thursday, May 17   Posted by Drew as  ER ,   Grey's Anatomy ,   Lost ,   Scrubs ,   The Office ,   What's On  at 5:54 PM EDT   17     3  Comments       It’s season finale night!     The Office  -  The Job  - NBC - 8/7c   Michael, Jim and Karen go to New York to be interviewed for a job opening; in Scranton, the new regime institutes sweeping reforms; Jan comes in with exciting news.   Scrubs  -  My Rabbit; My Point of No Return  - NBC - 9/8c   We finally can watch ‘Scrubs’ without wondering if it will be around next year.  Hooray!   J.D. invites Kim to move in with him so they can raise their child together; Carla helps Elliot plan for her upcoming wedding; the janitor vows to make Keith the perfect husband.   ER  -  The Honeymoon is Over  - NBC - 10/9c   Much to the chagrin of the county general staff, the new chief is ready to make some major changes in the E.R. Meanwhile, Kovac puts his honeymoon on hold while he travels back to Croatia to be with his ailing father. Gates is urgently called home when Sarah panics that she might be taken away. And a patient convinces Neela to attend an anti-war rally and consequently finds her life in peril.   Grey’s Anatomy  -  Didn’t We Almost Have It All?  - ABC - 9/8c   Cristina and Burke’s wedding day arrives along with the interns’ first exam results. A successor to the Chief is named and Callie and George make a big decision about their relationship.   I don’t know if ‘Grey’s’ can live up to last season’s finale…that was likely the best finale I think I’ve ever seen.  And hopefully the Gallie/Gizzie debate will finally close (fingers crossed for Gallie).   Lost  -  The Answers  - ABC - 10/9c   Executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse explore the mysteries of the island and recap some of the revelations made this season as well as those yet to come.   I typically don’t bother with “clip shows”, even if it’s ‘Lost’.  But I love the chemistry that Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof have on the podcast, so I’m hoping some of it will carry over tonight.                    What’s On - Thursday, May 10   Posted by Drew as  ER ,   Grey's Anatomy ,   My Name Is Earl ,   Scrubs ,   The Office ,   What's On  at 5:39 PM EDT   10     1  Comment       My Name Is Earl  -  The Trial  - NBC - 8/7c -  Season Finale!   Earl has it all - a GED, a job, a new apartment - and now with his new, unlikely love interest, Earl is finally an adult. Nothing can stop Earl on his road to maturity…except, of course, Earl himself. Joy, on the other hand, puts her future in the hands of the law as the trial finally arrives. Earl commits the ultimate good deed to help Joy, but ends up sacrificing everything. It all comes down to this trial and Earl’s shocking testimony.   The Office  -  Beach Games  - NBC - 8:40/7:40c - 9:20/8:20c   If you haven’t noticed, NBC has been extending the past few episodes of The Office to 40 minutes.   Kristin at eOnline  reports that the best comedy on TV may very well extend to one hour next season.  Specifically:   I’ve just heard from multiple insiders that it’s looking very likely that NBC will  double  the amount of  The Office  we’ll get next season. I’m told it’s looking like each episode will expand to be an hourlong; however, if that plan falls through for some reason, I’m hearing that, at the very least, NBC wants to pick up something like 37 episodes of the show in its current half-hour format.   Regarding tonight’s episode, NBC says:   Michael is being considered for a position in Corporate and has to recommend his replacement. While the group expects a fun outing at Lake Scranton, Michael has planned a day of Survivor-like competitions to find his successor. Meanwhile, Pam is not asked to join in any of the activities and is forced to watch Jim and Karen have fun together.   Scrubs  -  My Conventional Wisdom   - NBC - 9:20/8:20c - 10/9c   As Eliot begins to plan her wedding with Keith, J.D. continues to question his true feelings for her. In an attempt to ease his best friend’s mind, Turk takes him to a surgeon’s convention in Phoenix, but the plan backfires when J.D. runs into his ex-girlfriend Kim and comes face to face with the unexpected. Meanwhile, Kelso and his cronies party it up at the convention while unbeknownst to him, the Janitor takes on the role of Chief of Medicine back at Sacred Heart.   ER  -  Sea Change  - NBC - 10/9c   Stanley Tucci alert!  Stanley Tucci alert!  He’s in a guest starring role tonight, but there are rumblings that he’ll be around for good.   Kovac and Abby get used to their new roles as husband and wife while Hope and Morris enjoy the honeymoon suite. Pratt hopes to change his womanizing ways as he tries to win over a new woman. Meanwhile, there’s a new doctor in the E.R. — and he means business.   Grey’s Anatomy  -  Testing 1-2-3  - ABC - 9/8c   We’re back to Grey’s as usual tonight after last week’s ‘Private Practice’ spinoff pilot.    Exam day has arrived for the interns - and not everyone is ready. Callie’s suspicions of George and Izzie grow, and Cristina struggles to write her wedding vows.   Traveler  -  Pilot  - ABC - 10/9c   While it hasn’t been getting stellar reviews, it hasn’t been killed by critics, either.  I’m extremely interested in what they can do with this series.   Jay, Tyler and Will are friends who have spent the last two years in grad school. They are about to depart on a summer trip when a simple prank to rollerblade through one of New York City’s most famous museums makes Jay and Tyler prime suspects in a terrorist bombing that destroys the museum seconds later. Hopeful that Will can help clear up this misunderstanding, they learn he’s been missing since the explosion and think he may be dead. They’re unable to turn to authorities when they realize they can’t prove Will even exists. In every photo from the past two years, he has managed to block his face.   Who will believe them? Friends, family, lovers? The boys are pawns in a conspiracy that will take years to unravel, and the government may not have their best interests at heart. Their friendship will be tested like never before as they try to uncover the truth, while avoiding detection of not only the FBI, but everyone in America who has seen their faces on TV as suspects in the bombing.                    What’s On - Thursday, April 26   Posted by Drew as  30 Rock ,   ER ,   Grey's Anatomy ,   My Name Is Earl ,   Scrubs ,   The Office ,   What's On  at 4:34 PM EDT   26     2  Comments       Busy night tonight, so let’s get into it…   My Name Is Earl  -  GED  - NBC - 8/7c   After Earl is rejected to apply for a credit card for not having a high school diploma, a job, or a real place to live, he decides he needs to take some big steps towards finally growing up. When Earl returns to school to re-learn everything he needs to know to take his GED, he finds out how hard it is for teachers when they have to deal with students like the one he used to be when he was a kid.   The Office  -  Product Recall  - NBC - 8:30/7:30c   The office is in crisis mode after a large shipment of Dunder Mifflin paper is accidentally sent out with an obscene watermark — and Michael tries to manage the media with an impromptu press conference. Jim and Andy also attempt to calm the high school principal who has sent out prom invites on the affected stationery.   I think this premise has the makings of the funniest episode of Office we’ve seen.  I’m loving the new Andy, and can’t wait to see how he and Jim play off of each other.       30 Rock  -  Hiatus  - NBC - 9/8c   As TGS’ summer hiatus approaches, Liz deals with the difficulties of her long-distance relationship with Floyd while she enlists Kenneth’s help in locating on-the-lam Tracy. Meanwhile, Jack’s impending marriage to Phoebe brings his mother, Colleen Donaghy, to town.   Scrubs  -  My Turf War  - NBC - 9:30/8:30c   J.D. feels a little left out when Elliot’s wild sorority sister, Melody comes to town. Not able to deal with being the third wheel he turns the girls against each other in the hopes that he will once again be Elliot’s priority friend and, if he is lucky, that he might get to “mash” it with Melody. Meanwhile, Turk and Dr. Cox go head to head when they disagree over whether or not a patient requested surgery is necessary. Elsewhere, Carla discovers an unlikely ghost haunting pediatrics in an attempt to keep it clean.   A ghost?  Really?  Come on…I know that Scrubs has never been what you’d call realistic, but a ghost?   ER  -  Lights Out  - NBC - 10/9c   A busy ER is putting the pressure on Kovac to take care of the overflow of cases prior to being shut down for renovations. A lonely Sam befriends a terminally ill photojournalist with a negative outlook. Pratt gets a scare when his brother unexpectedly shows up in the ER. Meanwhile, the tension between Gates and his father hits an ultimate boiling point.   Grey’s Anatomy  -  Desire  - ABC - 9/8c   The attendings are extra-attentive to a patient, who is the chairman of the hospital board; Cristina helps Burke plan the wedding.                    What’s On - Thursday, April 12   Posted by Drew as  30 Rock ,   ER ,   My Name Is Earl ,   Notes From The Underbelly ,   Scrubs ,   The Office ,   What's On  at 5:20 PM EDT   12     NO  Comments       I’ve noticed that I have several shows that I watch that I really don’t have much to say about, so, rather than search my brain to find something creative to say, I’ll just give a little bit of what the network preview says.  So, here’s what’s on tonight:   My Name is Earl  -  Harassed a Reporter  - NBC - 8/7c   Earl’s back after a seven week hiatus (these long breaks suck…man, the  24 -formula has me spoiled).      Tonight, via  Spoilerfix , centers around how, back in his pre-karma days, Earl’s gang made up false news stories and would call up reporters to get the fake stories on the news.  Tonight Earl has to make up with a reporter whose career he destroyed with those fake stories.   The Office  -  Safety Training  - NBC - 8:30/7:30c   Having “I’m gonna lose my freaking mind” Andy return during the closing credits last week only to have Dwight pepper spray him immediately was absolutely classic.  Tonight, Andy’s ready to make a fresh start with his coworkers after undergoing anger management.  Also, the Dwight/Michael chemistry, which has been sorely absent over the past few weeks, should be back in full swing tonight as they show the hazards that can come from the dangerous work environment of Dunder Mifflin.   30 Rock  -  Corporate Crush  - NBC - 9/8c   NBC says:   Liz is happy in her new relationship with Floyd (Jason Sudeikis); a company executive (Rip Torn) warns Jack that he is keeping an eye on his performance.   Scrubs  -  My Words of Wisdom  - NBC - 9:30/8:30c   With last weeks departure of Nurse Roberts, we had a great example of  what I love about  Scrubs .  This show manages to be ridiculously hilarious one moment, then completely hits the brakes and can be soberingly serious the next.    NBC says:   After saying goodbye to Nurse Roberts, members of the staff incorporate some of her lessons into their lives.   ER  -  Photographs and Memories  - NBC - 10/9c   It’s also been a long time since we visited  ER .  So long, in fact, I’ve kind of competely forgotten everything that’s happened.  Let’s let NBC remind us:   A photographer (Annabella Sciorra) comes into the ER with a terminally ill patient; a new surgical intern, who appears to be Dr. Dubenko’s new favorite, upstages Neela.   Notes From The Underbelly  -  Pilot; Animal Style  - ABC - 10/9c   My wife’s super-pumped (pump…heh…that was not intentional) about this one, so it’s added to  my  watch list for Thursday nights.   Entertainment Weekly  gives it a B, saying:   Overall, however,  Underbelly  eschews cliché and makes pregnancy surprisingly laughable  including a very funny gag with a breast pump. A phrase I never thought I’d say.

The announcement was part of a news release NBC issued about its midseason schedule, which included the following:      ""The Office""  will have the coveted post-Super Bowl slot on Feb. 1.     The new drama ""Kings,"" starring Ian McShane, will premiere on Thursdays, beginning March 19.     ""Celebrity Apprentice"" will premiere on March 1 and will be expanded to two-hour episodes.     ""Medium"" will return to the lineup on Feb. 2, the same night that  ""Heroes""   kicks off its new volume and ""Chuck"" returns with a 3-D episode.     The miniseries ""XIII"" will air on Feb. 8 and 15.    Maria Elena Fernandez    (Photo: Maura Tierney as Abby Lockhart, Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris, courtesy Joel Warren / NBC)                      05:14 PM PT, Dec  3 2008         in      ER       ,    The Office       ,    TV News Tracker 2008           |  Permalink       |  Comments (1)        |  TrackBack (0)                                    'ER' is coming back              ""ER,"" one of televisions most honored programs, refused once again to go quietly into that good night and was officially picked up for a 15th and final season, NBC officials announced today.    Despite steadily declining ratings in recent years, the show will air 19 more episodes and return in the fall with the finale, now scheduled for February. The show will continue to air at 10 p.m. Thursdays, which it has occupied since the show premiered in 1994.    ""We really wanted to give ER the proper platform and the proper respect for being the most nominated show in television history,"" said NBC co-chairman Ben Silverman during a press event in New York City, where the network unveiled its programming plans for the next season.

Perhaps it's that time, time for ""ER"" to close its doors, and not just temporarily for a paint job.     Last night's episode was somewhat engaging, but only in the way that the same plot we've seen in other incarnations was being lobbed back at us. We began with foreshadowing on Luka (Goran Visnjic) and Abby's (Maura Tierney) relationship as Luka was suddenly called away to Croatia, by himself. Most of us know that this is Visnjic's last season on ""ER"" and clumsy allusions to terrorism early in the episode created a ""wonder how they'll make this happen"" feeling of non-tension.     As happens at least once a season, a promising new doctor has been introduced (Stanley Tucci) who, despite his acting chops and threats to force the ER to straighten up and fly right, will not be able to stir the pot enough to freshen the show after so many years.

Yeah, married!               So, Luka (Goran Visnjic) and Abby (Maura Tierney) finally tied the knot on ER.  But finally, though, really means thank goodness by law these two cant break up again, at least without some difficulty and not so much Yay! Theyre husband and wife! because the original appeal of Luka and Abby was their combined torturedness when they began their first incarnation as a couple so many years ago.  Watching them be blissfully married is kind of like a happy Elvis Costello song: its nice but its not the same without that bite of bitterness.      Once again, being a loyal fan didnt seem to pay off for viewers of ER.  Those of us who have watched since the beginning know that both Abby and Luka had been married beforeand in Lukas case, to a the mother of his children, all of whom were killed in war.  Youd think hed have at least some sort of flashback or pause to consider that or even say something to Abby about it.

Here's to a fine '09 full of good TV                                                                                         Emerging from my December blog hibernation, I'm much more inclined to look forward to what the small screen has in store for '09 than reassessing '08. Fortunately, my  Variety  colleague Stuart Levine was motivated to muse on his highs and lows for '08 (posted after the jump).    There's not a whole lot that I've penciled into my must-see sked for the first quarter. Of course, the Big Event is the  Jan. 21   return of  ""Lost""  for its high-five season (more on that later). The final two  ""Friday Night Lights""  segs of the season (maybe forever) on DirecTV  Jan. 7-14 , will be three-hanky affairs, for sure, according to sources who have already screened them. And there'll be more multicamera hijinks to enjoy from  ""The Big Bang Theory""  ensemble, my fave comedy troupe on the tube these days, hands down.    As for new material, I was very impressed by what I saw on the four-episode screener of Showtime's  ""The United States of Tara.""  Toni Collette is amazing as a suburban mother and artist who grapples with three distinct personalities who also inhabit Tara's corporeal being. The supporting cast is also strong, with John Corbett playing Tara's husband in an understated way, and the always-engaging Rosemarie DeWitt as Tara's sister. Brie Larson impresses as the older of Tara's two teenage kids.

Credit strong marketing and consistently compelling stories. Audiences who were once glued have come back for a last look.  And expect an even bigger Nielsen turnout when one of the most favored alumni comes back.  Well, Edwards returns but his character, Dr. Mark Greene, who died of cancer, can't. He's shown in flashback, interacting with the icy Dr. Cate Banfield, so adeptly played by Oscar-nominated actress Angela Bassett. Not to give anything away, but the two characters interact at a time that forever changes Banfields life. Im never been one to fall for the very special episode marketing ploy that NBC used with almost every show at one time or another, but this ones worth watching, especially if you go back to the early days of ER, when folks such as Edwards, George Clooney and Eriq LaSalle ran up and down the hallways. On a conference call with reporters, Edwards said he was a bit hesitant to return to Stage 11 on the Warner Bros. lot, where hed spent eight years, but felt the timing was right to come back. Yet, he still had butterflies You dont want to screw it up, you know, he said. I think theres a natural respect for this show that you want to, you know, be respectful of. And he was confident that if he returned, his characters hard-earned reputation wouldnt be tarnished. I knew they would take care of him. You know, its a funny thing. You feel as an actor that you own the character, but the truth is so do the writers. The writers really feel an ownership of Greene, so they want to do right for him. So, theres actually more people looking out for you than yourself in the end. Edwards, who appeared in David Finchers brilliant murder mystery Zodiac last year, has been heavily involved in charity work. He donated the money he wouldve received for appearing in this Heal Thyself episode to Shoe 4 Africa, in which hes raising money to build a hospital. ER exec producer John Wells and Steven Spielberg also contributed.

( See pic at left of ""House"" star Hugh Laurie in a bumper car at Fox's TCA party on the Santa Monica pier last summer.)    Yep, the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour is upon us, starting Tuesday at the Beverly Hilton hotel. The January TCA gathering was scuttled by the writers strike, so undoubtedly there will be pent-up excitement (agitation? irritation? ultra-obnoxious lines of questioning?) than usual among the scribes, execs and stars who make TCA go 'round.    As we did last year, On the Air will offer team coverage of this fortnight of frothing about shows to come and the strike-interrupted season that just was, and any other issues that crop up between Tuesday and July 22.  Variety' s Stuart Levine plans to park himself at the BevHilton for the duration, while our TV leader, Michael Schneider, reporter Daniel Frankel and myself will also be availing ourselves of the hotel's free Wi-Fi to cover the events...and drink. I'm guessing it's a safe bet that the tradition of TCA bingo (in which attendees track the over-use of buzz words by panelists) will include the phrase ""writers strike"" this year.     It all starts  Tuesday  with a heavy rotation of cable presentations, including Hallmark Channel, HD Net, BBC America and E! nets.    Wednesday's  lineup includes: AMC and WE; MTV Networks; A&E Networks    Thursday : Discovery Networks; ESPN; Sundance Channel; HBO    Friday : Turner Broadcasting; Fox Reality Channel; Starz; Lifetime    Saturday-Sunday : PBS -- whose talent roster includes none other than Sir George Martin, plugging his series ""On Record: The Soundtrack of Our Lives.""

TV prexy Peter Roth will watch with both glee and terror as the 2008-09 TV season kicks off.      Of the four new WB dramas picked up by the broadcast nets during last weeks upfronts, three have been thrown against each other in the same 9 p.m. Tuesday timeslot: The Mentalist (CBS, photo on right), Fringe (Fox) and Surviving the Filthy Rich (CW).     For better or worse, this kind of fraternal battle is becoming familiar for Warners. Mondays at 8 p.m. feature a head-to-head-to-head-to-head slugfest among four WB shows, as hourlongs Chuck (NBC), Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (Fox),  Gossip Girl (CW) face CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory.     Its a very high-class problem to have, Roth said. While it wouldnt necessarily be our preference to have programs competing against one another, we have been in this situation before.  We suggest since they are all great shows, viewers should watch one of them live, TiVo the others and, preferably, watch them within the advertiser-desired three-day window.       At 10 p.m. Thursday, WB rookie Eleventh Hour goes up against veteran ER, which will begin its 15th and final season. And on the comedy side, its no laughing matter for WB as Pushing Daisies (ABC) and The New Adventures of Old Christine (CBS) both vie for the same eyeballs at 8 p.m. Wednesday.

It was a great group of folks from the show  Wells, showrunner David Zabel, in-house director and EP Chris Chulack, actors Linda Cardellini, Mekhi Phifer, Scott Grimes, Maura Tierney, Parminder Nagra and John Stamos  and it gave one a chance to pause and reflect on ""ER's"" incredible 14-season run.      Back when ""ER"" launched in September 1994, it broke out like gangbusters in its 10 p.m. Thursday spot on NBC (and where it still remains) up against David E. Kelley's ""Chicago Hope."" Wells reflected on the hysteria the show brought out in fans in those early years, including when they were shooting on location in Chicago and 4,000 people came out to get a glimpse of George Clooney.    Cardellini, who I will always cherish for her turn in the beloved teen drama ""Freaks and Geeks,"" which was offed way too soon and I still miss to this day, kidded she wasn't a fan back then and everyone gave her a hard time. Tierney, whose character, Abby Lockhart, is mired in a serious case of angst this season, said she occasionally checked it out. She also added that she can't watch herself on the small-screen today  she was visibly squirming as the 300th episode screened  as she's way too critical of her performance.    Stamos provided plenty of laughs, recognizing his good fortunes in now having a chance to trade dialogue with these seasoned pros rather with the Olsen twins in ""Full House."" Nothing against the girls, of course, but they were tykes while he was trying to become a better actor, and it's tough to run lines when your colleagues are still learning how to read.      Wells, who was once the president of the Writers Guild and still sees himself as a scribe first and foremost, spoke on how it's tough to say how or when ""ER"" will end, with the state of the TV biz in such flux right now. But he acknowledged, certainly, the show is closer in time to its finale than to when it began. And as he and Warner Bros. know, ""ER"" is an expensive show to produce and with ratings nowhere where they used to be  and that's not a knock against just this show but for most longrunning series  there comes a point where the profit margins become too small for another season.    That being said, the quality of ""ER"" remains solid  a nice mix of medical traumas, personal stories and just the right amount of humor to make it all go down easy.     Stuart Levine    Photos: Kevin Parry/The Paley Center for Media                                                                                                                                                                                         Posted at 11:53 AM in  ER ,  John Stamos ,  John Wells ,  Linda Cardellini ,  Maura Tierney ,  Paley Center for Media ,  The West Wing     |   Permalink                                                              |  Comments (0)                                                                                         |  TrackBack (0)                                                                                                                     November  4             John Wells: If he can pull it off...                                                                                         Godspeed to John Wells and all of those who have been engaging in shuttle diplomacy during the past 48 hours in the effort to bring about a cease fire agreement between the WGA and the producers.    I sensed a shift in sentiment in the room Saturday night at Hollywood's Cabana Club during the ironically-timed 300th seg celebration of the Wells-produced ""ER"" -- a shining example of the kind of high-end scripted TV that is at risk in the WGA-Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers contract talks. (I confess to wondering if I wasn't being hopelessly Pollyanna-ish  with my post-party post below , but I also felt it couldn't hurt to put some hopeful vibrations out there.)    If Wells, given his background and experience, is the one who can get the sides to build a bridge, or even some temporary scaffolding, to prevent the pickets from going up all over town on Monday, he really will be ""the Eisenhower of all showrunners,"" as Warner Bros. TV boss Peter Roth intro'd him on Saturday night. Fingers crossed...

She'll be back as Jeanie Boulet, of course, though only the writers know where life has taken the one-time physical therapist in the eight years since the character exited the ""ER"" scene. I'm told Reuben's is a one-off return visit that has been planned for some time, a treat for the fans who have hung in with the show through thick and thin all these seasons.

Television Saturday night at the Cabana Club in Hollywood was all about what may transpire on Sunday and Monday.    Any gathering of TV industry insiders would have been abuzz with talk of the writers strike called for 12: 01 a.m. Monday and the Hail Mary meeting set for Sunday between the scribes and producers. But with ""ER"" in particular, it had to be the dominant theme given ""ER"" exec producer John Wells' background as a former WGA West prexy, one who skillfully helped avert a Defcon 4 scenario in 2001 when contract talks got heated (though not nearly as scalding as they are this time around).    In his brief remarks saluting the show and the people who make it, Warner Bros. TV prexy Peter Roth called Wells ""the Eisenhower of all showrunners,"" and his use of a militaristic comparison was not lost on the crowd, unconscious as it may have been on Roth's part. NBC U Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman was more pointed, saying that Wells was going ""fix all of it"" in relation to the strike.    During his turn at the mike, Wells didn't use the S-word (except to sheepishly scoff at Ben's remark), but he did note that he'd done the math, and in the 14 seasons since ""ER"" dawned, skein has produced some 24,682 pages of scripts.    Neal Baer, a WGA negotiating committee member and an ""ER"" alum (who now shepherds NBC's ""Law & Order: SVU"" and does the work of angels as a licensed physician in his spare time), was on hand and inundated by ""what's gonna happen?"" queries. It was intriguing to see Baer and Wells and former ""ER"" showrunner Lydia Woodward huddled in a heavy-duty discussion toward the end of the evening.    As befitting the spirit of ""ER,"" there was a define touch of optimism to all the strike talk among partygoers. The fact that a meeting was called for Sunday on Friday afternoon, hours after the WGA formally announced its plan to walk out on Monday, was widely dissected and discussed as a flicker of hope. There was also a feeling among the card-carrying types in the room that after Friday's strike announcement, some of the CEOs were starting to get more personally engaged and realize the serious-as-a-heart-attack-ness of the threat at hand.    Maybe, just maybe, there'll be enough of a give-and-take on Sunday for the scribes to hold their fire, even if it's 12- or 24 hour increments. Or in ""ER"" parlance, let's hope Sunday's meet turns out to be the final act of a two-parter, packed with guest stars and exotic location shoots, with a cliffhanger in the middle...and an uplifting ending by 11:59 p.m. Sunday.

Seth MacFarlane  and his crew are known to know how to celebrate their ""freakin' sweet"" milestones. This bash might lend itself to some TMZ moments, if Stewie gets out of hand...    There might be some TMZ action coming out of next week's  Hollywood Radio and Television Society  gathering of the heads of the five network families. The selection of  Barry Sonnenfeld , helmer and exec producer of ABC's ""Pushing Daisies,"" as moderator of the Oct. 16 luncheon has raised some eyebrows among rival nets. It's a head-scratcher for others, given that Sonnenfeld isn't exactly known for his emcee-ing skills. But for those of us who've complained about milquetoast HRTS moderators in the past, we've got to give Barry the benefit of the doubt. It outta be a lively sesh, anyway, with ABC's  Steve McPherson , CBS'  Nina Tassler , CW's  Dawn Ostroff , Fox's  Kevin Reilly  and NBC's  Ben Silverman ...

Real or Rumor: George Clooney in 'ER' Finale?           Copyright 2006 Bryan Bedder /  Getty Images The Internet and news media have been abuzz for quite some time now as to whether or not  George Clooney  will return to ""ER"" for the long-running show's final season. Now, ""ER"" Executive Producer  John Wells  lets the cat out of the bag. Or does he?  ""We are going to have a lot of people coming for the conclusion,"" Wells tells ET at the TCA panel for his new NBC series ""Southland."" ""We have already done some:  Anthony Edwards ,  Noah Wyle ,  Eric LaSalle . George is very busy; he is very handsome. He is just finishing up in Puerto Rico on a film. We have talked about it a couple of times.  ""We will be shooting down there at the end,"" continues Wells. ""If he comes by and wants to do something, we will make it work. We have a wonderful cast now. I would be surprised. But then, George loves practical jokes. Who knows?""  Clooney's rep was not reachable.  ET has learned that the final episode of ""ER"" will air Thursday night, April 2 now that they have extended the season's run by three extra episodes. A one-hour clip show retrospective will run just before the final episode airs.  Stay tuned to ET for more ""ER"" news!

As it turns out, Democratic Presidential hopeful Barack Obama and current US President George W. Bush are distantly related… as are Harry Truman, George Sr. and Dick Cheney.   Now I know that actually makes a lot of sense considering Obama’s diverse ancestry, but what really impresses me is that he can trace his family tree back to his great x 8 grandfathers! In my family, we can’t trace back much further than my great grandparents; our records just aren’t that good.   Kudos to the Obama/Bush/Truman/Cheney clan for keeping that family tree up to date. Awkward.       They fought leopards in Africa and for their lives on the American frontier. They served on the U.S. Supreme Court and stole from governors. They owned slaves in Maryland and cooperated with white oppressors in Kenya.   Presidential candidate Barack Obama’s ancestors are as diverse a group as one might expect for a man born to a mother from Kansas and a father from Kenya. Using interviews with family members and genealogists, a study of archives and records, and Obama’s book, ""Dreams from My Father,"" the Chicago Sun-Times has cobbled together biographies of 16 of Obama’s ancestors, from the noble to the, well, not-so-noble.   And his family tree has its share of surprises. Take, for instance, the distant relation to three U.S. presidents — Harry S. Truman, George W. Bush and George Herbert Walker Bush — as well as to Vice President Dick Cheney.   Obama’s ancestors hail from seven countries: Kenya, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany and the Netherlands. And he has seven half brothers and half sisters living across some 10,000 miles.   The Illinois Senator embraces the diversity of his heritage, referencing it during his now-famous 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention.   ""I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible,"" he said.   In a report in Sunday’s editions, the Sun-Times introduces characters like Obama’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather Jonathan Singletary, whose methods for discrediting enemies in colonial Massachusetts included accusing them of being witches.   Singletary was convicted of defamation and slander, and he was later arrested for stealing from the governor’s home.   Obama’s ancestors walked a different path in eastern Africa, where his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was a leader and respected warrior of the Luo tribe.   His paternal grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama, bragged of chasing away leopards during a two-week trek to Nairobi during colonial rule in Kenya. But — to his grandson’s dismay — he also worked for white oppressors, first supervising road crews and then working in a white man’s home.   While Obama’s relatives managed to escape ever being enslaved, many did own slaves themselves, a revelation that his campaign has responded to by saying his ancestors ""are representative of America.""   For his forebears who struck out across the American frontier, life could be cruel: Several ancestors were killed or kidnapped by American Indians in Kentucky.   Genealogists warn not to make too much of Obama’s links to U.S. presidents, saying they’re a distinction not uncommon to Americans with ties to New England.   Still, it’s worth noting that President Truman is Obama’s fourth cousin four times removed, and Obama and the current President Bush are 11th cousins, sharing the same great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents in 17th century Massachusetts. Obama and Cheney have a common ancestor who migrated from France in the 17th century.   Other public servants in Obama’s heritage include a second cousin of his great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Gabriel Duvall, who served in Congress and on the U.S. Supreme Court.   While Obama acknowledges being shaped by the diversity of his ancestors, the impact of a more direct relative — his Kansas-born mother, Stanley Ann Dunham — can’t be overlooked.   His parents divorced when he was just 2 years old, and his mother was left to raise him alone. She died in 1995 of ovarian cancer at the age of 53.   Obama has called her ""the single constant in my life"" and credits her influence for ""that what is best in me.""     source   Tags:  dumb news ,  barack obama ,  george w bush ,  harry truman ,  dick cheney ,  family tree ,  ancestors ,  melting pot       Share This   Related Stories NY Times Has Four Corrections Today Fox News’ Gibson Fires Racist Blast “George Bush” Shoe Flies - Off The Shelf Maybe Gramm Had Mental Recession Presidential Pardon for Doomed Turkeys      POSTED IN:  Dumb Pictures ,   Funny ,   Just Weird ,   Political Stupidity ,   Stupid Celebrities                         13 opinions for  Obama and Bush Related                                   Diane Rapaport       Sep 12, 2007 at 6:57 pm                 Read more about the exploits of Obama’s ancestor, 17th-century Jonathan Singletary (Dunham), in my new book, “The Naked Quaker: True Crimes and Controversies from the Courts of Colonial New England” (ISBN 978-1-933212-57-9) to be published in October by Commonwealth Editions,  http://www.commonwealtheditions.com .

CLICK HERE  for more photos and outtakes from  Radar 's interview.                  METHOD ACTOR  ""I actually think Brenda was a bad influence on me,"" Doherty says          (Photo: Photo by Kurt Iswarienko, Tony Cohen dress)                                      T he CW billed its launch of the new  90210  as ""the most anticipated event of the year,"" a boast that, given the Beijing Olympics, the presidential election, and the Cheech and Chong reunion tour, might have smacked of promotional overreach but for one salient detail: After a 14-year hiatus,  Brenda was back .     For a passionate segment of the TV viewing public—not only in America but also in the 90 or so countries that aired the original series—Doherty's comeback was monumental, Callas barnstorming into La Scala for one last turn as Medea.  La Divina retorna!    Premiering in October 1990, the compellingly hokey series about well-to-do if absurdly attired teens navigating a seemingly endless series of issues didn't just stabilize the young and wobbly Fox network, rescue  Aaron Spelling  from professional oblivion, and launch the blessed career of  Sex and the City  creator  Darren Star . The show was also one of the first pop offerings to woo the elusive and finicky Generation X. Despite the barbs of boomer critics like the  Washington Post 's  Tom Shales , who called it ""a vacuum, a perfect void, a black hole in the already vast and empty TV schedule,"" at its peak  Beverly Hills, 90210  pulled in more than 17 million viewers. It was one of the key cultural touchstones of the '90s, giving us the sideburn, the high-waisted jean, and, most indelibly, the impetuous, raven-haired Minnesota transplant Brenda Walsh—the pluckiest Minneapolis native to hit TV since Mary Richards.     ""I've worked for 27 years, steadily, thanks to very loyal fans. What's the one way to say thank you? To play a character that you thought you'd never play again in the one show they want to see."" On paper  90210  was an ensemble show; in practice, not so much. Never mind the stridently self-serious if dreamy Brandon, the button-nosed little-rich-girl-next-door Kelly, and the rehabbed rebel Dylan, with his amazing washboard Forehead of Angst. Forget spear carriers Donna, Steve, and David. And that uptight editor chick with the glasses who was, like, 46 in real life? Banish her from your mind. Brenda was the heart and soul of  90210 . Brenda was the one we tuned in for, the one we couldn't quite figure out, the one who somehow always just  demanded  attention. Shark-jump plot machinations aside, many of the best episodes were carried along on the blustery jet stream of her moods, which tended to start out chirpy and sarcastic before building to a fit of pique and climaxing in a punishing emotional shitstorm, which then inevitably gave way at the last possible moment—and here was the key point—to warm Brenda sunshine and smiles and hugs all around. Sure, the show ran six seasons after she was packed off to study in London, but the party, for all intents and purposes, was over.    Sitting outside under an arbor of bougainvillea in a favorite restaurant, Taverna Tony, located in a upscale strip mall a few minutes from her well-appointed Malibu dream house, the actress allows that some of the characters on the original series seemed uncannily responsible and sober-minded for their age, ""except for Brenda, which is why I liked her. Brenda was realistic. She was normal. Not many 16-year-olds are so morally correct, you know? She had her moments where she was a great girl, and her moments where she was a bitch and you wanted to kill her, times when she was completely peaceful and times where she would bitch-slap Dylan in the face and never talk to Kelly again. She had those extremes.""     When the CW first came a-calling, Doherty was dubious. ""As an actor, to go back and play a character that I had already, in my opinion, exhausted ... like, what's the challenge?"" she says. In the end, she relented. For the fans. ""I've worked for 27 years, steadily, thanks to very loyal fans. What's the one way to say thank you? To play a character that you thought you'd never play again in the one show they want to see.""                 THEN AND NOW  As Brenda on the original  90210 , and today          (Photo: Getty Images)         That may smack of noblesse oblige (Eva Perón couldn't have said it better), but it's also undeniably true. Buzz about the show, which had been simmering throughout the summer due to an extraordinary promotional push by the network, boiled over with the announcement that, in addition to  Tori Spelling  and  Jennie Garth , Doherty was coming back to school to give a master class, of sorts, in thea-teh. As if suddenly clueing in to who their real star was, the CW then rushed out a spot featuring Doherty delivering the deliciously coy come-on ""Miss me?"" Wild-eyed partisans of the old series were thereby mollified, declaring almost unanimously on the various fan forums and message boards that, okay, fine, they'd eagerly tune in for Shannen ...  but only for Shannen .     When Spelling subsequently withdrew amid reports that she'd been offered a lower salary than her classmates ($10,000-$20,000 per episode, reported Hollywood bloodhound  Nikki Finke , as opposed to the $35,000-$50,000 Doherty and Garth were getting), the chatter went into overdrive. The operatic backstage drama that plagued the original series—and arguably deepened and enhanced it—was back. Yay, intrigue!

Sounds like my God. Not so much about judgement as He is about love & grace. Cool! Way to go, Shannen!! Also, what she said about her fans...I'm a Charmed fan & a Shando fan, too. It's great to know we mean a lot to her.

Also, since some people were unable to finish their comics on time, we decided to extend the deadline for the Dumm Tryouts contest to Saturday at midnight.  So if you started a comic, you now have time to finish it and submit it!  If you already did one, do another!  There's still time!   More info HERE! .... For some reason I have this problem- when I go home to see family in Tahoe, where it is beautiful, and I feel happy and contented, and am surrounded by beauty, I ALWAYS have weird dreams and nightmares while I am sleeping there.    So of course I had one this Christmas when I was visiting! This retarded and frightening dream took place in 1998 or so, hence the highschool version of me, which is smaller and cuter than the one that exists today. I know there are people out there who HATE dream stories (hi Luke), but I like hearing other people's as well as talking about my own, so here is one for you! You're getting veeeeeerrrrrrrrry sleepy...............               (check out that retarded arm on Kathryn- hooray for failing at drawing fundamentals!)        . . . . . .       ...and that's when I woke up.    Drawing ""scary"" is really not something I'm very good at, so I cheated and added some photoshop spooky blobs and crap to the drawings of the little dead schoolgirls.    I didn't draw it, but I want to add that as well as the first group of dead girls that came off the bus, there was also a group of about 5 short little dead chola girls who showed up. Maybe I'll draw them sometime.    Ok that's it!    More people should draw their dream stories!

Go check her out , and read a little about her in the news post there! Anyhow, happy 2009!  Here's a fresh 2009 doodle! This year had better be good.  I made some resolutions, although I'll probably go back and edit these as I come up with better ways to improve myself (I stole this idea from  Steve Lambe ). RESOLUTIONS 1. Get better at drawing 2. Dispel the rumor that I dated John K (been with Luke almost 8 years now, no room to date ex-bosses- stop emailing me about this please!  T___T ) 3. Be more positive about living in disgusting Los Angeles (or maybe make progress towards getting out of this horrible city) 4. Be more positive in general 5. Eat more green stuff (like mint chip ice cream) 6. Be less nervous around people I perceive as more sophisticated than myself 7. Experiment more with painting and animation 8. Get going on the ""personal projects"" I am always talking about 9. Spend more time with hobbies besides drawing, like dancing or voice lessons 10. Get better at returning phone calls and emails Ok, enough serious stuff...here are some pictures I'm starting the new year by drawing with pencils!  It sounds stupid, but after drawing with pens for so long, pencils feel great and new and fresh.  I always color the ones I like, but Luke always likes the ones I'm not so crazy about!  Weird...actually, sometimes I get more comments on drawings I think will be boring to people. I like the one on the right I like the girl on the top, Luke likes the other one.  Of course!  :) What do you think?   Anyhow, I hope 2009 starts out great for everyone, and stays that way.  It seems a lot of people had a weird 2008...screw 2008!  2009 is the year for wonderful things!!!!!!!! Right??  RIGHT???!?!?!

HEY GUYS!! ***UPDATE*** I probably should have advertised this way earlier, but Dumm Comics is holding a contest!  Anyone, artist or not, is invited to do their own versions of Big Pants Mouse, Through the Porthole, Skadi, 1930 Nightmare Theatre, and Earthward Ho!  You can do them however you want!  The ones that make us laugh the most will be featured on the site.  Judging is on the 10th! Anyhow... I hope everyone got a break from life and enjoyed the holidays! I went to Lake Tahoe to be with my family for a whole week and had a load of much needed fun and relaxation. Winter was really beautiful this year...check out this photo I took from the porch on Christmas morning! I am quite at home in the snow (so long as someone else is willing to shovel it for me). One of the best things about visiting my home this month was getting to spend so much time with my big brother Pete. He's always busy with work and music and concerts and stuff, so I don't get to see enough of him. If you like heavy metal music, you should  check him out ! I think all the cartoonists in LA should revolt and force the studios to move to the lake. beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful stupid One more thing... Some people have written me nice notes lately wishing me a happy Christmas and stuff, but I haven't been able to write back because I didn't have internet during my vacation. I'm really sorry, please give me a bit to calm down- I went from non-stop work to non-stop relaxing and it's kind of a shock! I've got some posts planned for next year...here are some of the ideas: 1. That design theory/Disney reject post, if I can get smart enough to write it right 2. A lovely photo story about an axe murder, starring me and my brother 3. A new extra stupid comic...here's a preview: OK!!!!  Hope you guys will come back next year, again sorry for the lack of posts and competent responses!  Have fun tonight and kiss someone at midnight!

SO...I'm gonna wait for now to do that post.  Maybe if I can, I'll do it over Christmas break.  Right now all I'm really thinking about is taking a break from work and being with my family.  So here is some sketchbook fodder for you! Drawings of highschool pals.  I still want to do comics about these girls! Here are some crappy pages from when I got tipsy with  Christine/Miss Withers  at the Roost: Now you all know how I draw when I am completely retarded!!  Oh wait, that is all the time... Revenge of Bacon-Lips Here is Christine, by the way: ...and her sister Kathryn: Some drawings of dolls and a mormon: And here are two characters from an (maybe?) upcoming personal project that I want to do, maybe you've seen them on here before! Yeesh, sorry I don't have anything better to post, but I've really been busy lately!!  I've been doing a storyboard for the Mighty B at Nickelodeon, plus I had a few sicky patches, so I haven't been doing a lot of personal drawing,  Hopefully on my break I'll get some drawing time. Maybe this will excite you!!!! First we have do-it-yourself craft fun... make your very own Bessie ornament !  These things are all over the place at work and are very cute!  Check it out! ALSO!! Kali put up some new tracks on our  Kot'n Katie and Kali Kazoo MySpace page , so go listen!  ""Gates of Steel"" and ""There is a Time"" are two songs we sang at a party, and  Nico  was nice enough to record us. There is some background noise, but I'd be happy if you all would listen just the same. Click for link to almost happy songs! Happy Holidays everyone!!  I hope you all get lots of presents and crap!  Check back in a bit for some more drawings and stuff!

I was gonna do a nice post tonight but I'm so tired, I can't think very well. I'm going to delete this post when I figure out what I wanna show, but in the meantime here are some drawings of my cat and his weird bacon-lips.

Sorry for the lack of posts lately.  I have a new job, and I've been sick lately!

Drawing is starting to become fun again.    These ones are influenced by the illustrations in Japanese fashion magazines:     It must be a fun job doing that kind of thing.  The magazines I was looking at have so many different artists and styles, they don't stick to one look.    (P.S. Sorry  Sean , I stole your fabric pattern that you came up with for Through The Port Hole!  Forgive me.) I really like these hillbillly drawings a lot, even though a lot of people might see them as too scribbly.     Some day when I start seriously on doing my hillbilly cartoon, I'd like it to be more loose and retarded like these drawings.  They should all be cute but inbred, right??  I think so!     Maybe I'm weird but I find the occasional wall-eyed person to be very beautiful! Here is a drawing of a girl I am myspace friends with, her name is  Brie :  "

A year after they first met, Owen, the baby hippo that survived last December’s Tsunami, and Mzee, a 130-year-old tortoise are still best pals. They live together at the Haller Park preserve in Mombasa, Kenya.    Read more in  Tale of the tortoise and the hippo .

I guess it’s a hard call… While it might be good for Owen to meet and maybe live with another hippo, I don’t think it should be at the cost of excluding Mzee from his life.

I read it from the newspaper, I cut this part and still keep it.  I am a turtles/tortorises lover, I love to hear everything about this animal.

Peter                          April 17th, 2006 at 18:33                Peggy   I’m the photographer who took the shots, and still very closely involved with Owen & Mzee. Alot of people are worried about introducing Owen to Cleo and don’t like the idea of breaking upt the relationship with Mzee. As wonderful as it would be to keep them together, there are a couple of big problems. Firstly, like all young animals, Owen is learning alot from his guardian. In particular, he is copying Mzee’s eating habbits. He seems to be doing pretty well, but nobody is sure what the long term effects might be of a hippo eating leaves like a tortoise, rather than the grass that makes up a hippo’s normal diet. Secondly, as sweet as Owen is now, he won’t stay that way. He’ll eventually get to over three tonnes. These photos don’t show it, but Mzee already bears the scars of another encounter with a fully grown hippo. A few years ago, another hippo friend rolled Mzee like a football and cracked his shell rather badly. There’s no suggestion that Owen will do the same, but he could still inadvertently do a lot of damage. Although the risk is still relatively slight, the consequences of a wrong call would be disastrous. And like all difficult decisions, the longer they wait, the harder it will become. Of course if Owen and Cleo don’t get along, or Owen seems too attached to Mzee, they’ll rethink. But for the sake of all three (remember — Cleo has been alone for years too) it makes sense.

Irvington-on-the-Hudson, New York, ca. 1987. This home was designed in 1918 by an African American architect, Vertner Woodson Tandy, for an African American cosmetics magnate, Madame CJ Walker, on the Hudson River north of New York City. When Madame CJ Walker was asked why she built such a palatial home, she replied that she had not built it for herself but so that blacks could see what could be accomplished with hard work and determination. Villa Lewaro, the name of the estate, has significance for both its architect and original owner. Tandy was New York's first licensed black architect. This building was known as his best work.

 Friday, October 10, 2008                                                                        Nutroots use my SAT scoresheet to forge 'Palin grades'                                             UPDATE, 10/14/08, 8:12 a.m.— GAWKER GETS IT WRONG AGAIN ... AND MALIGNS ME:   Four days ago in the post below, I exposed how Gawker fell for a forgery that purported to be Sarah Palin's SAT scoresheet but was actually a Photoshop job—made by someone who stole my own scoresheet off my blog and pasted in bad grades. Last night, Gawker admitted it fell for a forgery—and maligned me by claiming the bad grades were mine. This morning, it backtracked—read more  here . My original post, published 10/10/08: Gawker—the same online rag that called me a  ""Crazed Christ-Loving Re-Virgin"" —is engaging in some craziness of its own: It's  asking  readers to judge the validity of what it says may be ""Sarah Palin's High-School Grades""—but is in fact a forgery made from  my  SAT scoresheet , which I posted  in January 2004 . A sleuth on the Straight Dope message board  identified my scoresheet  as the source of the forgery.  The forger lowered the grades and scores on the printout to make Palin,  an honor-society member , look like a mediocre student—but wasn't smart enough to hide the obviousness of the Photoshop job. Still, Gawker publisher Nick Denton—who earlier published e-mails  stolen  from Palin's personal account—  asserted  the fake was credible: ""The grades are mediocreappropriately the small-town girl scores a D in foreign languagebut not so dreadful as to immediately stretch credulity. And the first five digits of the social security number do match Sarah Palin's.""  UPDATE:  The forgery appears to have originated with a purported  ""Background Report""  on Palin that was posted anonymously to a Web site. It was swiftly swallowed blogs such as  Daily Kos  (""it sure seems credible""), and  Wonkette  (""a 425 verbal sounds about right"").  None of them apparently noticed or cared that the front page of the ""report"" revealed it to be an obvious fake: The document, which features purported DMV records from 2006,  bears a ""RECEIVED"" stamp  dated ""6-24-03."" And now, I will attempt to leave all this bloggy excitement behind for a while, as I am currently pursuing a master's degree in theology and need to study for midterms. And no, my GRE scores will  not  be forthcoming. TRACKBACK: Ace of Spades observes, ""Obamasphere So Scary Smart It's Taken In By Another Moronic Hoax."" NewsBusters' Warner Todd Huston also notes the story:  ""Fake Palin SAT Scores Fool Left-O-Sphere.""  And now the whole world knows I had a B average, 700 verbal, and 640 math. And this just in: Daily Kos' Jimmy Crackcorn really does care—he's  apologized . He also includes a neat animated graphic superimposing the forgery over my own scoresheet. The irony is that my high-school grades have now been exposed to hundreds of thousands of strangers—while Sen. Barack Obama's Columbia University transcript  remains hidden  at the candidate's insistence.

Lynn Walls befriended a teen, 14, online while playing World of Warcraft.     Walls found the excuse to ask for his cell phone number. Walls then supposedly sent the boy sexually explicit text messages. The boys father discovered them when he read them.   Lynn Walls  photos.

As part of NBC's deal with producer Warner Bros. TV and ""ER"" executive producer John Wells, the network also has ordered six episodes of Wells' new cop drama ""Police."" NBC and WBTV have been in intense negotiations during the past few weeks for a ""Police"" series pickup. The network had been asking for a 12-episode midseason order, while WBTV had been reluctant to commit to such a large order in light of NBC's recent decision to launch a Jay Leno-fronted talk show in the 10 p.m. hour in the fall, which would limit the network's needs for drama series. Story continues below  advertisement |  your ad here Meanwhile, NBC, WBTV and Wells also had been talking about adding three hours to the 19-episode final season of ""ER,"" which has been regularly winning its 10 p.m. Thursday slot. It is not clear how the extended season of ""ER"" will affect NBC's new drama ""Kings,"" which was slated to air in the slot following the ""ER"" series finale March 12. One possible scenario would have ""Police"" succeed ""ER"" in the slot as it was originally envisioned and see ""Kings"" move to another night. Ordered to pilot in June, ""Police"" is an ensemble show starring Tom Everett Scott, Regina King, Benjamin McKenzie and Kevin Alejandro as a group of police officers in Los Angeles.
