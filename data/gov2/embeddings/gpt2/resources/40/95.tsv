Petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock near Canyonlands National Park, south of Moab, south eastern Utah, USA              Rock carving known as ""Meerkatze"" (named by archaeologist Leo Frobenius), rampant lionesses in  Wadi Methkandoush , Mesak Settafet region of Libya.       Petroglyphs  are  images  created by removing part of a  rock  surface by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as ""carving"", ""engraving"", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with  prehistoric  peoples. The word comes from the  Greek  words  petros  meaning ""stone"" and  glyphein  meaning ""to carve"" (it was originally coined in  French  as  ptroglyphe ).   The term  petroglyph  should not be confused with  pictograph , which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of  rock art .  Petroforms , or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different.  Inukshuks  are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.              A petroglyph of a caravan of  bighorn sheep  near  Moab, Utah ,  USA ; a common theme in glyphs from the  desert  southwest       The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late  Upper Paleolithic  boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ( Kamyana Mohyla ). Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of  writing systems , such as  pictographs  and  ideograms , began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with  Western culture  was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except  Antarctica  with highest concentrations in parts of  Africa ,  Scandinavia ,  Siberia , southwestern  North America  and  Australia .     [ edit ]   Interpretation   There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of ""pre- writing "". They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or ""rock gongs"".  [ 1 ]   Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the  Nordic Bronze Age  in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between  tribes , in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The  Siberian inscriptions  almost look like some early form of  runes , although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.   Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people  migrated  widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 George Tate read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club at which a Mr John Collingwood Bruce agreed that the carvings had ""... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought.""  [ 2 ]  In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.  [ 3 ] .   Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in  Jungian psychology  and the views of  Mircea Eliade . According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other  atavistic  or  archetypal   symbols ) from different cultures and continents is a result of the  genetically  inherited structure of the human brain.   Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by  shamans  in an  altered state of consciousness [ 4 ] , perhaps induced by the use of natural  hallucinogens . Many of the  geometric   patterns  (known as  form constants ) which recur in petroglyphs and  cave paintings  have been shown to be ""hard-wired"" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs,  migraine  and other stimuli.   Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the  Kalahari  desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the  University of the Witwatersrand   [1] . Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:     Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the Sans world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.

(May 2008)       Chumash Rock Art  is a type of artwork created by the  Chumash people , mainly in caves or on cliffs in the mountains in areas of southern California.           Contents       1   Chumash people   2   Rock Art Locations   3   Shamans and Visions   4   Shamans and Rock Art   5   Rock Art Characteristics   6   Meanings of Rock Art   7   Conclusion   8   References               [ edit ]   Chumash people   Main article:  Chumash people   The Chumash lived in the present-day counties of  Santa Barbara ,  Ventura , and  San Luis  in southern California during the late period of history (c. AD 1300 to 1804). They were a  Hokan -speaking, maritime,  hunter-gatherer  society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as ""an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface."" Rock art may have been created by  shamans  during  vision quests , most commonly in the form of  pictographs  (paintings on rock), but sometimes  petroglyphs  (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Locations   Chumash Rock Art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been discovered by Campbell Grant. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the  Ventureno  area. The  Ventura  and  Santa Clara  rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the  Cuyama  region (north of the Ventureno area), where the  Sisquoc River  flows between the  San Rafael Mountains  and the  Sierra Madre Mountains . The most easily accessible example is at  Painted Cave SHP , an easy drive from  Santa Barbara, California .     [ edit ]   Shamans and Visions   According to David Whitley,  shamanism  was the ""cornerstone of religious beliefs in the Far West."" He defines shamanism as ""a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)."" In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a ""portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural."" The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or  altered state of consciousness . In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or  jimsonweed , shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'     [ edit ]   Shamans and Rock Art   Directly after the vision quest ended (usually after two or more nights), a shaman pondered and meditated on the visions he/she had been given by his spirit helpers. Then while still on the site of his/her vision quest he/she painted or engraved images onto rock surfaces (usually sandstone), depicting the spirits he/she saw and supernatural events he/she had been a part of in his/her vision, such as curing illness or making rain. The shaman spent so much energy remembering and concentrating on his/her visions because he believed that if any visions were forgotten, he/she would become ill and/or die. Whitley notes that the shamans also recorded their visions on rocks to be observed by future generations of shamans. The other members of the shaman's village took extra care not to go near, or even look at, the location where a shaman had his/her vision quest.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Characteristics   Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained  hematite  or  iron oxide , while yellow came from  limonite , blue and green from  copper  or  serpentine , white from  kaolin clays  or  gypsum , and black from  manganese  or  charcoal . Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.     [ edit ]   Meanings of Rock Art   In the early 20th century very little was known about Chumash rock art (or the rock art of southern California in general). When the art began to be studied in detail, two main questions arose from scholars: (1), who created rock art? and (2), what does it mean? A number of archaeologists attempted to address these questions; Julian Steward and Alfred Kroeber were among them. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain. However, the Native California Indians were very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some denied any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.: ""The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected,in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any"" (Grant 80). Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the idfferent Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ""Petroglyphs of California,"" Steward wrote: ""It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictrographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind...He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area"" (91).     [ edit ]   Conclusion   To this day, the exact meanings of Chumash rock art are largely unknown. It is generally believed that religion and astronomy play a role in the paintings, since the sun was an important part of their religion. The supernatural also played a role, through the vision quests of the shamans. Rock art was done as a representation of the interaction between the shaman and the sacred realm. Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says ""a  radiocarbon test  on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old'"" (123). Whether monochromatic or polychromatic, the rock paintings demonstrate the artistic talent of the Chumash people.     [ edit ]   References     Fagan, Brian. ""Ancient North America,"" 4th ed.

[ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs.   Somalia  has a large number of rock art found at sites across the country. The most prominent of these sites is the rock art recently discovered by French archaeologists in  Laas Geel .

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Cave paintings  are  paintings  on  cave  walls and ceilings, and the term is used especially for those dating to  prehistoric  times. The earliest known European cave paintings date to 32,000 years ago. The purpose of the paleolithic cave paintings is not known. The evidence suggests that they were not merely decorations of living areas, since the caves in which they have been found do not have signs of ongoing habitation. Also, they are often in areas of caves that are not easily accessed. Some theories hold that they may have been a way of transmitting information, while other theories ascribe them a religious or ceremonial purpose.

When  Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola  first encountered the  Magdalenian  paintings of the  Altamira cave ,  Cantabria ,  Spain  in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and increasing numbers of discoveries have illustrated their authenticity and have indicated high levels of  artistry  of  Upper Palaeolithic  humans who used only basic tools. Cave paintings can also give valuable clues as to the  culture  and beliefs of that era.     [ edit ]   Locations   Well known cave paintings include those of:     Lascaux , France   Pech Merle , near  Cabrerets , France  Official Site   La Marche ,in  Lussac-les-Chateaux , France   Chauvet Cave , near  Vallon-Pont-d'Arc , France   Cave of Altamira , near  Santillana del Mar ,  Cantabria , Spain   Cueva de La Pasiega ,  Cuevas de El Castillo ,  Cantabria , Spain   Cosquer Cave , with an entrance below  sea level  near  Marseille, France   Font de Gaume , in the  Dordogne  Valley in France     Other sites include  Creswell Crags ,  Nottinghamshire ,  England , (Cave etchings and  bas-reliefs  discovered in 2003), and Magura  [1] , Belogradchik,  Bulgaria .   Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of  erosion . One well-known example is the rock paintings of  Astuvansalmi  in the  Saimaa  area of  Finland .     [ edit ]   Age   Nearly 350 caves have now been discovered in France and Spain that contain art from prehistoric times. The age of the paintings in many sites has been a contentious issue, since methods like  radiocarbon dating  can be easily misled by contaminated samples of older or newer material [ citation needed ] , and caves and rocky overhangs (parietal art) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. Recent advances make it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself.  [2]   The choice of subject matter can also indicate date such as the  reindeer  at the Spanish cave of  Cueva de las Monedas  which imply the art is from the  last Ice Age . The oldest cave is that of  Chauvet , and its paintings are possibly 32,000 years old according to  radiocarbon  dating  [3] . Some researchers believe the drawings are too advanced for this era and question this age [ 1 ] .   Other examples may date as late as the Early Bronze Age, but the well known prolific and sophisticated style from Lascaux and Altamira died out about 10,000 years ago, coinciding with the advent of the Mesolithic period.          Spanish Cave Painting of Bulls         [ edit ]   Themes and patterns   The most common themes in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as  bison ,  horses ,  aurochs , and  deer , and tracings of human  hands  as well as abstract patterns, called  finger flutings . Drawings of humans are rare and are usually schematic rather than the more naturalistic animal subjects. Cave art may have begun in the  Aurignacian  period ( Hohle Fels , Germany), but reached its apogee in the late  Magdalenian  (Lascaux, France).   The paintings were drawn with red and yellow  ochre ,  hematite ,  manganese oxide  and  charcoal . Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first.     [ edit ]   Theories and interpretations   Henri Breuil  interpreted the paintings as being hunting magic, meant to increase the number of animals. As there are some clay sculptures that seem to have been the targets of spears, this may partly be true, but does not explain the pictures of predators such as the  lion  or the bear.   An alternative theory, developed by  David Lewis-Williams  and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary  hunter-gatherer  societies, is that the paintings were made by  Cro-Magnon   shamans . The  shaman  would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way toward explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to  predators  and human hand-prints).   R. Dale Guthrie [ 2 ]  has studied not only the most artistic and publicized paintings but also a variety of lower quality art and figurines, and he identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists. He also points that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the over-sexual representation of women in the  Venus figurines ) are to be expected in the fantasies of adolescent males, who made a big part of the  human population at the time .     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs. Human figures are much more common in African than in European rock art. [ 3 ]   Recently, an archeological team discovered the  Laas Gaa'l  cave paintings outside  Hargeisa  in  Somaliland . They show the ancient inhabitants of the area worshipping  cattle  and performing religious ceremonies.   Cave paintings found at the  ""Apollo 11 caves"" in  Namibia  may be among the earliest cave art. The estimated age of the images date from approximately 23,000 - 25,000 B.C.   Cave paintings are found in the  Tassili n'Ajjer  mountains in southeast  Algeria  also in the  Akakus ,  Mesak Settafet  and  Tadrart  in Libya and other Sahara regions including: Ayr mountains, Niger and Tibesti, Chad. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Australia   Significant early cave paintings have also been found in  Kakadu National Park  in  Australia .   The  park  has a large collection of  ochre  paintings. Ochre is a not an  organic material , so  carbon dating  of these pictures is impossible. Sometimes the approximate date, or at least, an  epoch , can be guessed from the content.

AD 1300 to 1804). They were a  Hokan -speaking, maritime,  hunter-gatherer  society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as ""an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface."" Rock art may have been created by  shamans  during  vision quests , most commonly in the form of  pictographs  (paintings on rock), but sometimes  petroglyphs  (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Locations   Chumash Rock Art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been discovered by Campbell Grant. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the  Ventureno  area. The  Ventura  and  Santa Clara  rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the  Cuyama  region (north of the Ventureno area), where the  Sisquoc River  flows between the  San Rafael Mountains  and the  Sierra Madre Mountains . The most easily accessible example is at  Painted Cave SHP , an easy drive from  Santa Barbara, California .     [ edit ]   Shamans and Visions   According to David Whitley,  shamanism  was the ""cornerstone of religious beliefs in the Far West."" He defines shamanism as ""a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)."" In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a ""portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural."" The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or  altered state of consciousness . In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or  jimsonweed , shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'     [ edit ]   Shamans and Rock Art   Directly after the vision quest ended (usually after two or more nights), a shaman pondered and meditated on the visions he/she had been given by his spirit helpers. Then while still on the site of his/her vision quest he/she painted or engraved images onto rock surfaces (usually sandstone), depicting the spirits he/she saw and supernatural events he/she had been a part of in his/her vision, such as curing illness or making rain. The shaman spent so much energy remembering and concentrating on his/her visions because he believed that if any visions were forgotten, he/she would become ill and/or die. Whitley notes that the shamans also recorded their visions on rocks to be observed by future generations of shamans. The other members of the shaman's village took extra care not to go near, or even look at, the location where a shaman had his/her vision quest.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Characteristics   Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained  hematite  or  iron oxide , while yellow came from  limonite , blue and green from  copper  or  serpentine , white from  kaolin clays  or  gypsum , and black from  manganese  or  charcoal . Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.     [ edit ]   Meanings of Rock Art   In the early 20th century very little was known about Chumash rock art (or the rock art of southern California in general). When the art began to be studied in detail, two main questions arose from scholars: (1), who created rock art? and (2), what does it mean? A number of archaeologists attempted to address these questions; Julian Steward and Alfred Kroeber were among them. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain. However, the Native California Indians were very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some denied any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.: ""The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected,in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any"" (Grant 80). Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the idfferent Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ""Petroglyphs of California,"" Steward wrote: ""It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictrographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind...He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area"" (91).     [ edit ]   Conclusion   To this day, the exact meanings of Chumash rock art are largely unknown. It is generally believed that religion and astronomy play a role in the paintings, since the sun was an important part of their religion. The supernatural also played a role, through the vision quests of the shamans. Rock art was done as a representation of the interaction between the shaman and the sacred realm. Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says ""a  radiocarbon test  on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old'"" (123). Whether monochromatic or polychromatic, the rock paintings demonstrate the artistic talent of the Chumash people.     [ edit ]   References     Fagan, Brian. ""Ancient North America,"" 4th ed.

[ 9 ] ,  [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs.   Somalia  has a large number of rock art found at sites across the country. The most prominent of these sites is the rock art recently discovered by French archaeologists in  Laas Geel .

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock near Canyonlands National Park, south of Moab, south eastern Utah, USA              Rock carving known as ""Meerkatze"" (named by archaeologist Leo Frobenius), rampant lionesses in  Wadi Methkandoush , Mesak Settafet region of Libya.       Petroglyphs  are  images  created by removing part of a  rock  surface by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as ""carving"", ""engraving"", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with  prehistoric  peoples. The word comes from the  Greek  words  petros  meaning ""stone"" and  glyphein  meaning ""to carve"" (it was originally coined in  French  as  ptroglyphe ).   The term  petroglyph  should not be confused with  pictograph , which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of  rock art .  Petroforms , or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different.  Inukshuks  are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.              A petroglyph of a caravan of  bighorn sheep  near  Moab, Utah ,  USA ; a common theme in glyphs from the  desert  southwest       The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late  Upper Paleolithic  boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ( Kamyana Mohyla ). Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of  writing systems , such as  pictographs  and  ideograms , began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with  Western culture  was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except  Antarctica  with highest concentrations in parts of  Africa ,  Scandinavia ,  Siberia , southwestern  North America  and  Australia .     [ edit ]   Interpretation   There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of ""pre- writing "". They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or ""rock gongs"".  [ 1 ]   Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the  Nordic Bronze Age  in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between  tribes , in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The  Siberian inscriptions  almost look like some early form of  runes , although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.   Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people  migrated  widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 George Tate read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club at which a Mr John Collingwood Bruce agreed that the carvings had ""... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought.""  [ 2 ]  In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.  [ 3 ] .   Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in  Jungian psychology  and the views of  Mircea Eliade . According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other  atavistic  or  archetypal   symbols ) from different cultures and continents is a result of the  genetically  inherited structure of the human brain.   Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by  shamans  in an  altered state of consciousness [ 4 ] , perhaps induced by the use of natural  hallucinogens . Many of the  geometric   patterns  (known as  form constants ) which recur in petroglyphs and  cave paintings  have been shown to be ""hard-wired"" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs,  migraine  and other stimuli.   Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the  Kalahari  desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the  University of the Witwatersrand   [1] . Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:     Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the Sans world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.

[ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

[ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.

Petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock near Canyonlands National Park, south of Moab, south eastern Utah, USA              Rock carving known as ""Meerkatze"" (named by archaeologist Leo Frobenius), rampant lionesses in  Wadi Methkandoush , Mesak Settafet region of Libya.       Petroglyphs  are  images  created by removing part of a  rock  surface by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as ""carving"", ""engraving"", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with  prehistoric  peoples. The word comes from the  Greek  words  petros  meaning ""stone"" and  glyphein  meaning ""to carve"" (it was originally coined in  French  as  ptroglyphe ).   The term  petroglyph  should not be confused with  pictograph , which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of  rock art .  Petroforms , or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different.  Inukshuks  are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.              A petroglyph of a caravan of  bighorn sheep  near  Moab, Utah ,  USA ; a common theme in glyphs from the  desert  southwest       The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late  Upper Paleolithic  boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ( Kamyana Mohyla ). Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of  writing systems , such as  pictographs  and  ideograms , began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with  Western culture  was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except  Antarctica  with highest concentrations in parts of  Africa ,  Scandinavia ,  Siberia , southwestern  North America  and  Australia .     [ edit ]   Interpretation   There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of ""pre- writing "". They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or ""rock gongs"".  [ 1 ]   Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the  Nordic Bronze Age  in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between  tribes , in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The  Siberian inscriptions  almost look like some early form of  runes , although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.   Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people  migrated  widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 George Tate read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club at which a Mr John Collingwood Bruce agreed that the carvings had ""... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought.""  [ 2 ]  In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.  [ 3 ] .   Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in  Jungian psychology  and the views of  Mircea Eliade . According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other  atavistic  or  archetypal   symbols ) from different cultures and continents is a result of the  genetically  inherited structure of the human brain.   Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by  shamans  in an  altered state of consciousness [ 4 ] , perhaps induced by the use of natural  hallucinogens . Many of the  geometric   patterns  (known as  form constants ) which recur in petroglyphs and  cave paintings  have been shown to be ""hard-wired"" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs,  migraine  and other stimuli.   Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the  Kalahari  desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the  University of the Witwatersrand   [1] . Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:     Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the Sans world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.

clueweb09-en0005-06-08589	        Rock Art                                  Rock Art is a general term for all forms of humanly fashioned marks on lithic surfaces. The term is a general category that includes at least two distinctive types of art known as petroglyphs and pictographs.   Petroglyphs verses Pictographs    Petroglyphs  This type of rock art is the formation of images usually found from the Neolithic period, by people who incised or carved the rock surface. Often, these images were important forms of pre-symbol writing and were used in the earliest forms of communication and signage.  The two Greek words petros and glyphein which respectively mean rock and carve were first combined into the French language to form the single word petroglyphe.    Pictographs  A pictograph, or sometimes called a pictogramme, is an image that represents an object, activity, concept, event or a place or person by use of illustration. In contrast to petroglyphs, pictographs are a true form of symbolic writing where ideas are communicated through the drawing. Pictographs form the basis of the more famous hieroglyphs and the expansively used wedge-shaped cuneiform writing.  Many pictorial road signs, such as an image of a worker with a spade or a profile silhouette of children walking, are modern types of pictographs. In such instances they transmit a specific and essential message: Road works and workers ahead and children crossing or likely to be in the area such as a school.  Although most contemporary cultures use pictographs only for simple symbols some non-literate societies in South America, Africa, and Australasia still use them as their main medium of written communication.  The Chinese who developed pictographs into a logographic writing system around 2000 BC used pictographs as early as 5000 BC.   The Earliest Rock Art  The oldest rock art objects are petroglyphs that have been ascribed to the Neolithic or late Upper Paleolithic boundary. They are found in the rock shelters of Bhimbetka, India and as far south as Australias Aboriginal Mimi Art of the Western Arnhem Land.                    Rock art pre-dates the Great Egyptian pyramids and was an adaptation of new environments, altered capacities for thinking in the abstract, and a desire to cross-communicate in an expanded social and economic complexity.  Rock art provides us with descriptive information about ancient social actions, the material culture, its economy, religion and political structures, and environment and its changes, including major natural disasters.  However, although the information is present on the rock surface, interpretation of its meaning is a difficult task. One main problem with interpreting the drawings or carvings is identification of the subjects. Many images are highly stylised and are often distorted from reality, not because of any lack of artistic ability by the artist, but more often due to religious perceptions or socially diffused ideologies.  Therefore, it is not uncommon for the modern analyst to misread the symbols and bring an interpretation from a 3M perspective perhaps observing that many little stick figures appear to be running away from the big human when actually, the ancient artist intended to show that seven spirits left the great chief when he died.   World-wide Resemblance  Rock art does not appear to have evolved but rather it seems to have burst, fully developed, into ancient life, simultaneously, according to the resources available to them. One of the astonishing observations made by rock art researchers is the noticeable resemblance of style of petroglyphs across all continents. Is it reasonable to assume that all cultures would be influenced by their surroundings, therefore, commonality is expected in content and subject matter but there is nothing to explain a common style.  Conservative analysts observe that a localized catastrophe with sufficient magnitude to cause a rapid international dispersion of people coupled with a later worldwide cataclysmic event, such as a universal deluge, would reduce global civilizations to a technological infancy but with a common ancestry.   Hand Stencils  Adult hand stencils have been found in caves throughout the world. Blowing or throwing paint or dye over an open hand placed on a rock wall produces the artwork. Many stencils appear with one or more short or incomplete fingers on the hand. This phenomenon was thought to be restricted to only a few caves and was explained as deliberate digit mutilations or amputations, possibly due to disease, or by animal interaction, perhaps while hunting wild animals.  The occurrence of short-fingered stencil art paintings is actually more widely represented than first thought. Experiments have shown that the images were made with the missing fingers simply bent over and it now appears that rather than attempting to immortalize an image of a diseased hand, the owner of the print was perhaps using a more universal illustration to signal something yet uninterpreted.   The Living Past in Pictures  Aboriginal rock art depicts their myths and legends, rituals, religion and magic. It involves their dreamtime stories of creation, their beginnings, their beliefs and their lives. The strong desire to describe their reality in art includes the hills, rivers, lakes, mountains, deserts, animals and people: All of the things that we admire in a painting. Rock art provides a living landscape of the past, which is still alive today, and may remain so well into the future.                                    Stumble It!    Digg this!

[ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs.   Somalia  has a large number of rock art found at sites across the country. The most prominent of these sites is the rock art recently discovered by French archaeologists in  Laas Geel .     Tassili N'Ajjer  in  Algeria  -  national park  and  World Heritage Site   South Oran  in Algeria   Saharan rock art       [ edit ]   America     [ edit ]   Mexico           Rock paintings of the Sierra de San Francisco ,  Mexico       The  Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco  is the name given to prehistoric rock art found in the Sierra de San francisco region of Baja California, Mexico, created by a people referred to as Cochimi or Guachimis. There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Eventually, the settlement grew into the Town of Lakeside, now incorporated as the Town of  Pinetop-Lakeside . Despite now being surrounded by homes, Rainbow Lake remains open to the public for fishing, boating, bird watching or just enjoying the outdoors.

The land surrounding the lake is privately owned and inaccessible to the public; however, the Department owns a small parcel of land adjacent to the dam, and maintains it for public fishing and recreational boating. To reach this parcel, turn south on Rainbow Lake Road or Lakeview Lane from Highway 260.     [ edit ]   Description   Rainbow Lake is 116 acres (0.47 km 2 ), and has a maximum depth of 14 feet (4.3 m) and an average depth of 7 feet (2.1 m). Currently, the  Arizona Game and Fish Department  stocks catchable-sized  rainbow trout  in the spring and early summer. Naturally propagating warm water species include  largemouth bass ,  channel catfish ,  black bullhead ,  bluegill  and  green sunfish . The lake also contains illegally introduced  northern pike . Because it is shallow and weedy, Rainbow Lake is subject to water quality problems.

This campground has 82 sites, vault toilets, potable water and firewood for sale. You can make reservations for a campground site by visiting  www.reserveusa.com  on the Web or by calling 1-877-444-6777. Additional amenities, in the form of boat rentals, are available from Rainbows End Resort, a private business adjacent to the public access area. Cabin rentals are available at Lazy Oaks, where guests can use one of two private fishing piers or rent a boat.     [ edit ]   Fish Species     Rainbow   Largemouth Bass   Sunfish   Catfish (Channel)       [ edit ]   Fishing Techniques   Because so much shoreline is privately owned, Rainbow Lake is best fished from a boat. The spring and early summer are the best times to fish for trout because that's when water quality is at its best, the weeds are down and the Department is stocking fish. Troll for  trout  with Panther Martin and Rooster Tail spinners, small Kastmasters or wooly bugger flies. You may also have some luck fishing from shore with worms or Power Bait. Casting near structure with spinner baits works well for  largemouth bass  and  northern pike . Fish on the bottom with night crawlers or stink baits to catch black bullheads and  channel catfish .     [ edit ]   Special Notes   Statewide fishing regulations apply and a trout stamp is required. The daily bag limit is six trout; three for unlicensed anglers under the age of 14. Boat motors are restricted to either electric or 10 hp (7.5 kW) gas motors or less.

It was released by  Discovery Games  in 1977 and re-released by  Avalon Hill  in 1979.   Set in the 19th century, the object of the game is to explore the interior of  Africa , make an important discovery, and report it back to  European   civilization . The  explorers  must outfit their  expeditions  and choose a method of travel, be it  canoe ,  camel  or  foot . At the outset of the game the map of the interior of Africa is blank. As explorers enter each unexplored  hex , a card is drawn to determine the  terrain  and events, if any, that befall the explorers.  Crayons  are used to draw terrain on the map as it is discovered.   The explorers must confront  dangers  such as  starvation ,  disease ,  river cataracts  and hostile natives. The game is, in fact, highly lethal to explorers, but if a player loses an explorer he or she may create a new one who re-enters the game at a  coastal   port .   The player must choose a profession, and the amount of points a player gains for particular discoveries will vary depending on their choice. In particular:     Zoologists  get points for discovering animals.   Botanists  get points for discovering exotic plants.   Missionaries  get more points when dealing with natives.   Geologists  gain points for minerals.   Doctors  gain points for medicinal items.   Journalists  gain points for almost any encounter, even with other players.   Ethnologists  gain points for discovering native villages       [ edit ]   External links     Source of the Nile  at  BoardGameGeek             Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_of_the_Nile_(board_game) ""      Categories :  Historical board games  |  Avalon Hill games                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                                                   This page was last modified on 20 February 2009, at 05:30.

Camping, hiking, and fishing are available                                     up to 10,000 feet in quality alpine settings.                                     This is the best place to be in the fall                                     when the aspen leaves turn. While there are                                     some bass and catfish in a few of these lakes,                                     the majority of the fish found in these waters                                     are trout. Morethan 90 percent of the trout                                     available to anglers are provided through                                     the Arizona Game and Fish Department's fish                                     hatchery system.

Anglers can also catch Apache trout                                     in the West Fork of the Black River, one                                     of the few areas in Arizona and the only                                   place in the country where these trout exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                       North Central Region:  Waters                                       and species chart                                           This area has the greatest                                      variety of fising in the state. Both cold                                      and warmwater lakes and streams are found                                      from Flagstaff at 7,000 feet to Camp Verde                                      at 2,500 feet. The Verde River offers smallmouth                                      bass, channel catfish, flathead catfish                                      and roundtail chub, while Lake Mary has                                      wallee, largemouth bass and crappie. Small                                      lakes around Williams and Flagstaff offer                                      weekly stocking of trout, and Oak Creek                                      has the best wild brown trout population                                      in the area. Surrounded by the Coconino,                                      Kaibab and Prescott national forests, this                                      area offers pine trees or desert all within                                   two hours of Phoenix.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mogollon Rim:  Waters                                       and species chart                                             Most of the fishing                                          in thisarea is in small trout lakes.                                          These lakes were constructed by the                                          Arizona Game and Fish Department during                                          the '50s and '60s. The lakes are in                                          pine forests at about 7,000 feet. Camping                                          is available at or near each lake from                                          May to September. The Department stocks                                          these lakes from April through September.                                          The very best trout fishing is in the                                          spring and fall. The best stream fishing                                          is found in Canyon Creek, Chevelon Creek                                   and East Clear Creek.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Colorado River Northwest:  Waters                                       and species chart                                          This area includes waters                                     of the Colorado from Lake Havasu to Lake                                     Powell. There are four major reservoirs in                                     this area which offer a wide variety of fishing                                     from striped bass to trout and largemouth                                     bass to catfish. This area also includes                                     the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead. With the                                     exception of the area around the Grand Canyon,                                     this area is desert and quite hostile in                                     the summer. When fishing or camping in this                                     corner of the state always be prepared for                                     the unexpected. Carry plenty of water for                                     yourself and extra gas for the car or boat.                                     Don't find yourself stranded in a remote                                     location without provisions. This is one                                     of the most beautiful and exciting areas                                   of the state, but also the most dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Central Arizona:  Waters                                       and species chart                                        More fishing activity                                     takes place on these lakes than in any other                                     area of the state. They are also the closest                                     waters to the largest population center in                                     the state. These waters provide the best                                     largemouth bass, crappie and catfishing in                                     the state. Lakes Pleasant and Roosevelt are                                     best for largemouth bass and crappie, while                                     Roosevelt and Bartlett are best for catfish.                                     One of the most overlooked fishing experiences                                     in this area is trout fishing the Salt River                                     below Saguaro Lake. Take advantage of this                                     year-round trout fishery in the summer when                                     the air temperatures are 100° F and the                                   water is 65° F.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Southeastern Arizona:  Waters                                       and species chart                                          Arizona's grasslands                                     run rfom Tucson and Wilcox to the Mexico                                     border. This corner of the state offers small                                     bodies of water nestled in rolling hills                                     dotted with oak trees. These lakes offer                                     bass, bluegill, and catfish in the summer                                     and trout in the winter. The two exceptions                                     are located on top of Mount Lemon and Mount                                     Graham. Both of these lakes are in pine/spruce                                     forests and are stocked with trout in the                                   summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Southwestern Arizona:  Waters                                       and species chart                                           This area covers that                                      portion of the Colorado River south of Parker                                      Dam to Yuma near the Mexico border. If you                                      want to see the Colorado River as it was                                      pre-settlement, this is the place to go.                                      From Imperial Reservoir upriver through                                      the Cibola national Wildlife Refuge, it                                      is Arizona on the Colorado as it was. This                                      strech of river is excellent for flathead                                      catfish from April through October. There                                      are also trophy largemouth bass (over 12                                      lbs.) caught from backwater lakes along                                      this section of river each year. The very                                      best largemouth bass fishing in this area                                      occurs at Alamo Reservoir located east of                                   Parker on the bill Williams River.                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Directions are approximate and using Yahoo Maps.

clueweb09-en0011-77-18496	"          The Tigua Indians of Texas     by R Edward Moore         Back to the Texas Indians home page  at     WWW.TexasIndians.com     | sources |         The Tigua are the only Puebloan tribe still in Texas. The Pueblos are   a number of different Indian tribes who lived in the southwest. The southwest   includes far west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona with bits of southern Colorado   and Utah. All these different Puebloan tribes shared similar ways of living,   even though they spoke different languages and had slightly different cultures.   Other Puebloan tribes in Texas include the long gone prehistoric Pueblos   along the Canadian River in the Texas Panhandle and probably the Jumano.     Before we go to the Tiguas lets learn a little more about the Pueblo   Indians. The Pueblos are a group of different tribes who are all much alike,   so much alike we group them together. First, lets find a way to understand   how a group of people can be the same and yet very different at the same   time. Think of European and American ways of living. Europeans and Americans   live in houses and buildings that are much alike. They eat similar foods   and wear similar clothing. Most Americans and Europeans are Christians,   but there are many kinds of Christians. An outsider from another planet   might think all Europeans and Americans were the same. But they speak English   and French and German, and a bunch of other languages. Europeans and Americans   can see the many small differences in their clothing, food and buildings.   No American or European would mistake a German city for a Spanish city   or an American city.     So Europeans and Americans share very similar culture, but they are   also different in important ways.. The Pueblo Indians were like the Europeans   and Americans. They spoke many different languages and had slightly different   cultures. There were, and still are, Hopi Puebloans, Taos Puebloans, Jimez   Puebloans, Zuni Puebloans and, of course, our Tigua Puebloans. These are   all different tribes. But, because they share so much culture in common   we group them together as Puebloan.     The main thing that sets the Puebloan Indians apart from other Indian   tribes are their distinctive houses. They build Pueblos. Their name, Pueblo,   is Spanish and means ""town"". That is what we still call Pueblo   Indian towns, Pueblos. A Pueblo is also a big building with many rooms   in it. Sort of like our modern apartment buildings. Families live in a   group of rooms in a Pueblo. Often many families live in one Pueblo. Many   Pueblos had hundreds of people living in them. Some Pueblos were 4 or 5   stories high. In larger Pueblos there are several individual Pueblo buildings   built around a plaza or square. Really big Pueblos like the Zuni or some   of the Hopi Pueblos have several squares or plazas. The plazas are used   all year round for ceremonies and group activities. Puebloan Indians have   lots of ceremonies. So when the Spanish saw the big towns with the buildings,   the Pueblos, they named the people who built them Pueblo Indians.     Lets stop here and take a look at one of these Pueblos.                  This is a Pueblo. I believe this is an old picture of Taos Pueblo. The   old Tigua Pueblo of Gran Quivera would probably have looked a lot like   this. Notice the wooded frames in the front. These are for shade in the   hot New Mexico summers. The women would spend the day under them. The little   domes are ovens made of mud bricks. These ovens are called ""hornos"".   The women would bake corn tortillas and other foods in them. This Pueblo   has European style doors on the ground floor. In the old days no Pueblo   would have doors on the ground level, they would have openings in the roof.   Notice the ladders. They use ladders to get on the roof to get in the houses.   They could pull the ladders up if an enemy attacked. This Pueblo is at   least four stories high. Also look at the rows of logs sticking out of   the walls up at the tops of each house. These logs support the roof. The   next picture is a picture of one of these roofs from inside looking up.         You can see here how smaller sticks are laid on top of the large logs.   The cracks are filled with a mud plaster. There are even smaller sticks   on top of this layer and mud plaster on top of that to make the roof. These   kinds of roofs are not very good if it rains often or for several days.   The environment where these are found is a dry arid climate so they work   well. All the layers of mud and wood provide good insulation from the heat   in the summers and cold in the winters.     Pueblos are built several ways. One way is to use rocks to build a wall   and cover the rocks with a plaster of mud on the outside. The Pueblo of   Gran Quivera that we will be talking about later was built this way. Another   popular way was to use big bricks made out of dried mud. This is called   adobe brick construction. An adobe brick wall would be covered with a mud   plaster just like the rock wall so both would look the same when finished.   The roof was made by laying large logs on top of the walls. You can see   the ends of these logs sticking out of the wall. Smaller logs and sticks   would be laid on top of the big ones and mud would be packed down on top   of the logs and sticks. The mud roof would be smoothed out to make the   roof a living area. Building with mud plaster for roofs only works in dry   climates like the southwest where the Pueblos lived.                These are some Pueblo women baking bread. The domed shaped thing they   are in front of is a horno. A horno is a kind of oven used by Pueblo Indians   to cook bread and tortillas in. Look at the houses in the background. Those   are pueblo houses. Notice the ladders to get up on the roof. They use the   roof like a porch. They work and hang out on the roof. Even now that they   have doors they still use the roof and keep ladders to get up on them.   Notice the end of the logs sticking out of the wall on the house on the   left.     Pueblo Indians, including the Tigua, are farmers. Most of their food   comes from crops they plant and tend. Corn is the main crop they plant.   Notice I used the verb ""is"" and not ""was"". The Pueblos   are still here and they still farm. They also raised many other crops.   For food they raised beans and squash. They also raised cotton that they   used to make cloth. They also raised gourds that could be dried out and   used as containers.     They stored and cooked their food in well-made pottery. The Tigua and   other Pueblos are famous for their beautiful pottery. Much of this pottery   has painted designs that are very pretty.     The men hunted deer, rabbits, antelope, bear and any other wild game   they could find for meat. The women and children would collect wild foods   like berries when they were in season.     They knew how to grow cotton and weave cotton cloth. So their clothes   were made of cotton. They also used leather and fur on their clothes. The   men would wear a breach cloth. A breach cloth is what Tarzan wears. Now   you know what one looks like!! Here is an old picture of some Isleta Pueblo   women and a girl in traditional clothes.                These clothes are a mix of the old styles and materials and new European   materials. This picture was probably taken around 1900.     The land they farmed was all owned by the tribe but each family was   given the right to farm a plot of land. The family never owned the land,   they just farmed it. This is called usufruct land ownership. Usufruct means   the land is owned in common by the tribe, but families and individuals   have the right to use certain plots of land. Use that word on your teacher   and see what happens!! ;-) Most Indian tribes owned things like land as   a group and not as individuals.     The men cleared the fields and prepared the soil. The women did most   of the farming. They used sharp sticks to poke holes in the dirt and put   seeds in each hole. The children would walk the fields every day and pick   insects off the plants by hand and would pull up weeds. WWW.TexasIndians.com   Often a small house was built in the field and men and older children would   sleep in it to drive off animals and protect the crop.     There were important religious ceremonies that had to be done at each   stage of the farming season. There were dances and ceremonies before planting.   There were more dances and ceremonies while the crops were growing to bring   rain and protect the crops. The biggest dances and ceremonies came with   the harvest of the crops.     To farm you need water. Most of the southwest is semi desert and very   dry. Because of this most of the Pueblos lived along the rivers and streams.   A few lived near springs. Crops like corn also need at least 120 days of   frost and freeze free weather. Much of the southwest is in mountains were   it is cooler. So the Pueblos lived in the valleys were is was warmer in   the spring and fall.     The biggest river in this region is the Rio Grande River. Before they   came to Texas the Tiguas lived along the Rio Grande River south of modern   Albuquerque New Mexico.                      The Tigua called their ancestral home Pueblo Gran Quivera. Gran Quivera   was north of El Paso in the Manzano Mountains southeast of Albuquerque.   Manzano means Apple in Spanish so these are the Mountains of the apple.   Gran Quivera was started about A D 800. By 1300 it was one of the largest   Pueblos.     The Spanish explorer Coronado was the first European to see Gran Quivera   in 1539. The Spanish called Gran Quivera ""Pueblo de los Humanas"",   which means ""city of the humans"".     In the 1600s more Spanish came and founded missions and settlements   in New Mexico around Gran Quivera. With the Spanish came diseases and epidemics   that killed many of the Pueblo Indians including the Tigua of Gran Quivera.   The Spanish also would take Pueblo Indians to act as slaves in their settlements.     In the 1670s there was a bad drought that lasted several years. Food   was in short supply. The population of Gran Quivera dwindled and got smaller   and smaller. By 1675 they were desperate so they left. They went south   to the Rio Grande River near modern El Paso. They settled there and started   farming. Some of the Tigua went north to live with their close relatives   at Isleta Pueblo. The Isleta Puebloans spoke Tiwa like the Tigua. Gran   Quivera was left abandoned. The ruins are still there and are protected   by the National Park Service.     The Tigua still remember Gran Quivera in their prayers and songs. A   verse in one song goes, in English,     ""My home over there,    Now I remember it,     And when I see it,    the mountain far away     Oh, then I weep,    Oh, what can I do?""     In 1680 all the Pueblo Indians revolted against the Spanish. They drove   the Spanish out of New Mexico and down to El Paso. In 1681 Spanish came   back and attacked Isleta Pueblo. Many of the Isleta Puebloans managed to   run away and escape. But, the Spanish captured many of them. The Spanish   forced these Isleta Pueblo prisoners to come with them to El Paso. These   were both Isleta Puebloans and Tiguas. The Isleta Indians who ran away   did come back to their Pueblo and made peace with the Spanish. Isleta Pueblo   is still there today and the Isleta Pueblos still live there on a reservation.     In 1682 the Tigua and Isleta near El Paso founded Ysleta. Ysleta is   a different way of spelling Isleta. They did this to avoid confusion with   Isleta. By this time they had become Christians and they built a mission   church at Ysleta. The Ysleta mission is the oldest church in Texas and   the oldest mission in Texas. The Spanish King gave them a grant of land   around their Pueblo. This gave them title to the land.     The Ysleta mission and the Pueblo were right next to the expanding town   of El Paso. Eventually the Tigua were living as a suburb of El Paso. The   still live there today. Their neighborhood is called in Spanish ""El   barrio de los Indians"". After the Americans took over in 1848 of crooked   land speculators stole much of the Tigua land from them. The State of Texas   ignored the Tigua's Spanish land grant and title to the land. www.TexasIndians.com   Much of present day El Paso is built on land taken from the Tigua. This   left the Tigua very poor. Only the land around the Ysleta mission and their   houses was still theirs.                  These are some Tigua houses near El Paso around 1900. These are not   Pueblo style construction. They are made in a style called jackal. That   is a Spanish word pronounced Ha Calle. Jackal houses are made of sticks   stuck in the ground and then covered with mud. It is not a very good way   of making permanent buildings. You can see these are already falling apart.   Only very poor people build jackal houses. Look on the left of the houses   at the rectangular things in the stack covered with a tarp. Those are adobe   bricks used to build proper pueblo houses. They were probably making them   when they could and storing them till they had enough to build an adobe   pueblo house. Notice the domed shaped horno the women cook in right out   in front.             Here are some Tigua houses around 1930. Maybe these were built from   the adobe bricks in the other picture. Another horno is out front.           The leader of the Tigua is called a Cacique. The also have a war chief.   These two leaders lead most of the ceremonies today. The Tigua still respect   their ancestor's religious beliefs by performing many of the old ceremonies,   dances and songs. They have a drum that is very old they use in these ceremonies.   The drum has been handed down for generations and no one knows how old   it it. They also go to Catholic mass at the mission church. Saint Anthony   is their patron saint.     Near El Paso is a special place called Hueco Tanks. Hueco tanks are   a rocky outcropping in the middle of a desert. There are many caves and   springs with water in Hueco Tanks. The springs form lakes and pools in   depressions and hollows in the rock at Hueco Tanks giving it its name.   Hueco means bowl in Spanish and refers to the bowl like depressions in   the rock and a tank is a small lake or pool of water. The Tigua consider   Hueco Tanks to be a sacred place. They go there to worship. Hueco Tanks   is now a Texas State park. The Park Service lets the Tigua in to worship.   In the caves and cliffs there are pictures drawn on the rocks called pictographs.   Many Indians, including the Tigua, made these pictographs.     By the 1930s many people thought the Tigua were extinct. But they were   not. In the 1960s they began asserting themselves and laying claim to the   land they had lost. In 1968 Texas finally recognized the Tigua as a tribe.   Later in 1968 Lyndon Johnson signed an act of the U S Congress recognizing   the Tigua as a tribe and making their land a reservation. This is where   the Tigua still live.         Copyright by R E.

Covered by the oceans, continental margins are part of the same crust (thin, solid outermost layer of Earth) that forms the continents. They are covered in sediments that have been eroded from dry land. (Erosion is the gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water.) Lying between the deep ocean basins and the above-water land areas, continental margins account for 11 percent of Earth's surface.   The shape of the land   The continental margin is the submerged outer edge of a continent. It is generally divided into two sections: the continental shelf and the continental slope. The continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers). The average width worldwide is about 40 miles (64 kilometers). The widest shelves are in the Arctic Ocean off the northern coasts of Siberia and North America. Narrow shelves are found off the western coasts of North and South America. Continental shelves along the coasts of the United States cover an area of about 891,000 square miles (2,307,690 square kilometers).   Continental shelves are normally gently sloping, with an average seaward slope of about 0.1 degree. They tend to have the same topography or surface features that dominate the adjacent land. Whether a coastal area is mountainous, dominated by low hills, or flat, the continental shelf next to it will be similarly shaped. The average depth of the continental shelf at the shelf break is about 430 feet (131 meters) below the surface of the ocean.             Basic composition of continental margins, which include the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise.         In contrast to the continental shelf, the continental slope is generally narrow in width, ranging from 6.2 to 62 miles (10 to 100 kilometers). Relatively steeper than the shelf, the slope angles down to the ocean basin at an average of 4 degrees; in some areas, the angle may be as much as 25 degrees. The steepness of a slope often reflects the steepness of the nearby coastal area. Slopes along mountainous coasts are steeper than those along flat coasts. In general, the steepest slopes tend to be found in the Pacific Ocean and the least steep slopes in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.   The continental slope marks the transition between continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust is composed mostly of granite, whereas oceanic crust is mostly basalt. (Although they differ in composition, both are types of igneous rock, which forms when magma cools and solidifies. Granite forms when magma with a high silica content cools slowly deep beneath Earth's surface; basalt forms when magma with a low silica content cools quickly outside of or very near Earth's surface.)   The most distinctive features of continental slopes are submarine canyons. Typically, these are steep-walled, V-shaped canyons that may be thousands of feet deep. The incline of a canyon is normally related to that of the slope: steep slopes have short, steep canyons, while broader slopes have longer, shallower canyons. The deepest of the submarine canyons easily rival the size of the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River in Arizona. Sometimes, submarine canyons begin at the outer edge of the continental shelf. Most often, they form down-current from major rivers that flow into an ocean. Geologists believe that some submarine canyons may have been carved during a time in Earth's past when sea levels were lower than at present, and rivers were able to flow out to the edge of the shelf. Other canyons may have formed when earthquakes created faults or cracks along slopes that were subsequently eroded into the canyons.       Continental margin: Words to Know     Accretionary wedge: A mass of sediment and oceanic rock that is transferred from an oceanic plate to the edge of the less dense plate under which it is subducting.   Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.   Asthenosphere: The section of the mantle immediately beneath the lithosphere that is composed of partially melted rock.   Continental drift: The hypothesis proposed by Alfred Wegener that the continents are not stationary, but have moved across the surface of Earth over time.   Continental margin: The submerged outer edge of a continent, composed of the continental shelf and the continental slope.   Continental rise: The gently sloping, smooth-surfaced, thick accumulation of sediment at the base of certain continental slopes.   Continental shelf: The gently sloping region of the continental margin that extends seaward from the shoreline to the continental shelf break.   Continental shelf break: The outer edge of the continental shelf at which there is a sharp drop-off to the steeper continental slope.   Continental slope: The steeply sloping region of the continental margin that extends from the continental shelf break downward to the ocean basin.   Convection current: The circular movement of a gas or liquid between hot and cold areas.   Crust: The thin, solid outermost layer of Earth.   Erosion: The gradual wearing away of Earth surfaces through the action of wind and water.   Lithosphere: The rigid uppermost section of the mantle combined with the crust.   Mantle: The thick, dense layer of rock that lies beneath Earth's crust.   Passive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity.   Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.   Plate tectonics: The geologic theory that Earth's crust is composed of rigid plates that ""float"" toward or away from each other, either directly or indirectly, shifting continents, forming mountains and new ocean crust, and stimulating volcanic eruptions.   Seafloor spreading: The process by which new oceanic crust is formed by the upwelling of magma at mid-ocean ridges, resulting in the continuous lateral movement of existing oceanic crust.   Subduction zone: A region where two plates come together and the edge of one plate slides beneath the other.   Submarine canyon: A steep-walled, V-shaped canyon that is cut into the rocks and sediments of the continental slope and, sometimes, the outer continental shelf.   Trench: A long, deep, narrow depression on the ocean basin with relatively steep sides.   Turbidity current: A turbulent mixture of water and sediment that flows down a continental slope under the influence of gravity.         Geologists know that underwater currents called turbidity currents have eroded most submarine canyons. These turbulent mixtures of water and sediment develop near the continental shelf break when some event, such as an earthquake or a violent storm, triggers their formation. Denser (heavier) than the surrounding water, the currents are pulled downward by gravity. Flowing down the continental slope like an avalanche at up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, the sediment-laden currents surge through the canyons, scouring their sides. When the currents reach the ocean basin, they slow, and the sediment they carry falls to the bottom in a fanlike deposit, much like an alluvial fan that forms in a desert environment when water flows out of a canyon onto a plain or flat area. (For further information on alluvial fans, see the  Dune and other desert features  chapter.)   At the base of certain continental slopes is a gently sloping, smooth-surfaced, thick accumulation of sediment from land that had been transported to the shelf and then down the slope. This transition between the continental slope and the ocean basin is known as the continental rise. Some sources include the continental rise as being a major section of the continental margin, along with the shelf and slope. Since it does not occur on all continental margins around the planet, it is best considered a characteristic of the margin in certain areas. Continental rises are well-developed around Antarctica and in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. They are hardly found in the Pacific. When they are present, continental rises vary in width from 62 to 620 miles (100 to 1,000 kilometers).   A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin. Because these margins are found along the east coasts of North and South America and the west coasts of Europe and Africa, they are also known as ""Atlantic-type"" margins. The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins.   A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment. Earthquake and volcanic activity are prominent here. Since active continental margins occur along many coasts of the Pacific Ocean, these types of margins are also known as ""Pacific-type"" margins.     Forces and changes: Construction and destruction   The two types of continental margins, passive and active, tell about the geologic history of Earth and the activities that are continually affecting its surface. The continents are not stationary, but move about the planet's surface. That movement varies, but in general is extremely slow, only about 2 inches (5 centimeters) per year. Over millions of years, however, the continents have made their way along on an endless journey across the planet's surface, repeatedly crashing into or breaking away from one another.     A Burial and Dumping Ground   Continental shelves have not always been covered by water. During Earth's history, changes in sea level have alternately exposed, then covered portions of the shelves. Scientists estimate that during the last glacial period over 10,000 years ago, much of Earth's water was trapped in the polar ice sheets. The level of the oceans may have dropped as much as 350 feet (107 meters) below the current level. At times of low sea level, land plants and animals, including humans and their ancestors, lived on the shelves. Evidence of this lies in their remains that are often found there in the present day. Twelve-thousand-year-old bones of mastodons, extinct relatives of the elephant, have been recovered off the coast of the northeastern United States.   Because water above continental shelves is not that deep, sunlight is able to penetrate, helping plants grow. This, in turn, leads to a rich web of sea life. Most commercial fishing takes place in these waters. Extensive deposits of oil, natural gas, minerals, and other natural resources lie beneath continental shelves. The economic benefit of the fish and natural resources is important to many nations, which claim territorial ownership of the continental shelves adjacent to their land areas. Many political disagreements have arisen because of this. In spite of their desire to reap the benefits contained over and in the shelves, many nations illegally dump much of their waste in the ocean over these areas.     The drifting continents   In 1915 German geophysicist Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) published a book in which he presented geological evidence that all the continents had once been joined together in a supercontinent he called Pangaea (pronounced pan-JEE-ah; from the Greek words meaning ""all lands""). Wegener suggested that the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean formed when this supercontinent broke apart and the continents drifted away from each other. He called his hypothesis continental drift. (A hypothesis is an educated guess, while a theory is a principle supported by extensive scientific evidence and testing.)   Wegener formed his hypothesis after he had observed that the present-day continental margins along some of the continents seemed to fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle: eastern South America with western Africa, eastern North America with western Europe, and India and Antarctica with eastern Africa. When the continents are linked, some of their geological features, such as mountain ranges and mineral deposits, also match. In addition, related species of land animals are often present on both side of the present-day oceans. Wegener argued further that if the continents had drifted, they would have passed through various climate zones. This explains how evidence of past glaciers could be found in the Sahara desert region and why fossil coral reefs appear north of the Arctic Circle.   The theory of plate tectonics   What Wegener lacked, however, was a convincing explanation as to what moved the continents along the surface. Evidence to support his hypothesis did not come until the early 1960s when geologists developed the theory of plate tectonics (from the Greek word  tekton,  meaning ""builder""). A revolutionary idea, it helps geologists and others understand how Earth has changed over long periods of time. Changes in the positions and features of the continents and oceans have had a profound effect on everything from global climate to the evolution of life.   Simply, the theory states that the surface of the planet is broken into sections—some large, some small—called tectonic plates. As these plates drift slowly over Earth, they slide past, collide with, and move away from each other. The boundaries where the plates meet and interact are called plate margins. What moves the plates along occurs within the planet.   Geologists divide Earth into three distinct layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core. Each layer has its own unique properties and composition. As already mentioned, the crust is the thin shell of rock that covers Earth. Two types of crust exist: continental crust, which underlies the continents, and oceanic crust, which underlies the oceans. Varying in thickness, the crust is thickest below land and thinnest below the oceans.   Underneath the crust is the mantle, which is separated into two layers: The uppermost part of the mantle is solid. Along with the overlying crust, it forms what is called the lithosphere (pronounced LITH-uh-sfeer). It is the brittle lithosphere that has broken into the tectonic plates. Under the lithosphere is the part of the mantle known as the asthenosphere (pronounced as-THEN-uh-sfeer). Beneath Earth's surface, temperature and pressure increase with increasing depths. Rock in the asthenosphere is hot             Cross-section of Earth's interior, with the solid inner core, molten outer core, mantle, and crust.         enough to fold, stretch, compress, and flow very slowly without fracturing. It is puttylike in its consistency, or what geologists call ""plastic."" The rigid tectonic plates ""float"" on the more dense, flowing asthenosphere.   The core, lying at the center of the planet, is divided into a liquid outer layer and a solid inner layer. Made up of the metallic elements iron and nickel, the core is almost five times as dense as rock on Earth's surface. Temperatures in the core are estimated to exceed 9,900°F (5,482°C), creating extreme heat energy.   Moving the plates   This heat energy moves the tectonic plates across the planet's surface. It is carried to the area beneath the plates by convection currents, which act similar to the currents produced in a pot of boiling liquid on a hot stove. When a liquid in a pot begins to boil, it turns over and over. Liquid heated at the bottom of the pot rises to the surface because heating has caused it to expand and become less dense (lighter). Once at the surface, the heated material cools and becomes dense once more. It then sinks back down to the bottom to become reheated. This continuous motion of heated material rising, cooling, and sinking forms the circular convection currents.   Like a gigantic furnace, the core heats the mantle rock immediately above it. Expanding and becoming less dense, the heated rock slowly rises through cooler, denser mantle rock. When the heated rock reaches the lithosphere, it moves along its base, exerting dragging forces on the tectonic plates. This causes the plates to move. In the process, the heated rock begins to lose heat. Cooling and becoming denser, the rock then sinks back toward the core, where it will be heated once more. It takes an estimated 200 million years for heated mantle rock to make the circular trip from the core to the lithosphere and back again.   As the plates move, they interact in several different ways. Where they diverge, or move away from each other, new lithospheric rock is created as magma rises up through the crust at the plate boundary and gradually begins to cool. Many boundaries of diverging plates are on the floors of the oceans. They are known as mid-ocean ridges, and the process of new ocean crust forming at the ridges is known as seafloor spreading.   Where plates converge, or move into one another, either they crumple up and compress or one plate slides beneath the other. When two continental (land) plates converge, the crust bends and breaks from the collision, forming complex mountain ranges and very high plateaus. When a continental plate and an oceanic plate converge, the oceanic plate (which is thinner, yet denser) bends and plunges at an angle into the asthenosphere beneath the continental plate. As it does so, its leading edge begins to melt because of high temperature and pressure in the mantle. This forms thick, flowing magma (molten rock beneath the planet's surface). Less dense than the rock that surrounds it deep underground, the magma rises toward Earth's surface, forcing its way through weakened layers of rock. In most instances, the magma collects in underground reservoirs called magma chambers. It remains there until enough pressure builds up to eject it onto the planet's surface through vents called volcanoes. (For further information, see the  Volcano  chapter.) The process of one plate sinking beneath another is known as subduction, and the area where it occurs is known as a subduction zone.   At about 10 percent of the plate boundaries, the plates neither diverge nor converge; instead, they transform or slide past one another. On land, such a boundary is called a slip-strike boundary. A classic example of such a boundary is the San Andreas Fault system, an area of cracks in Earth's surface that occurs at the boundary between two tectonic plates, which extends down the coast of California.   Passive continental margins   The passive continental margins of eastern North America, eastern South America, western Africa, and western Europe began to form about 200 million years ago when Pangaea began to break up. The rift or crack that caused them to split, known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, now lies on             Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.           the ocean floor. Tectonic activity continues along the rift, but seafloor spreading has moved the plates thousands of miles away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Thus, the continental margins along these continents are considered tectonically quiet.   Although they are the ""trailing edge"" of the continents, passive continental margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries. Erosion is the primary force acting on them, having continually deposited sediment from dry land since their formation. In places along passive margins in the Atlantic Ocean, the sediment measures more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep. Because they are built seaward by the sediment, passive margins may also be called ""constructive"" margins. They do not fill completely with sediment because the underlying crust subsides or sinks into the soft mantle, providing additional room for sediment to accumulate.   Active continental margins   Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates. These areas are sites of tectonic activity, such as earthquakes and the formation of large volcanic mountains. Examples include the Andes Mountains along the western coast of South America. Coasts along active margins are typically lifted upward by the subduction of the oceanic plate, forming terraces and cliffs that are eroded by the ocean's waves. The seaside cliffs on the northwestern coast of North America are such an example.   The ""leading edge"" of a continental plate as it moves across Earth's surface, an active margin lacks a wide shelf. In fact, a shelf may not even exist. The margin's narrow slope may begin close to the coast, then angle steeply downward into a trench formed where the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate. When the oceanic plate slips beneath the less dense plate, rock may be scraped from the oceanic plate. These scraps of oceanic crust accumulate with sediment to form what are called accretionary (pronounced ah-KREE-sha-nair-ee) wedges that build up on the landward side of the trench.   Spotlight on famous forms   Monterey Canyon, off the coast of California   The largest submarine canyon on the west coast of the United States lies in Monterey Bay just south of San Francisco, California. First discovered in 1857 and labeled a submarine gulch, Monterey Canyon rivals the Grand Canyon in size and complexity. Almost perfectly bisecting the floor of the bay, the canyon begins just off the shore in 30 feet (9 meters) of water. It then extends 60 miles (97 kilometers) out into the ocean, widening while dropping to a depth 2 miles (3 kilometers) beneath the surface.   The steep walls of the canyon are lined with cliffs, ridges, crevices, and sediment-covered shelves. The canyon contains several smaller side canyons. Where it meets the ocean floor, the canyon opens and the sediment that has washed down through it spills out into a fan. Over its life, the canyon has been filled and refilled with sediment that has helped scour and erode the canyon's walls.   Geologists believe the canyon formed 25 to 30 million years ago. The reason behind its formation is still debated. Some believe that the powerful outflow of an ancient river from the southern end of the present-day San Joaquin Valley carved the canyon when the river flowed through a gap in the mountains and into the bay. Since that time, the bay and the surrounding land has slowly moved northward along the San Andreas Fault to its present location. Other geologists believe an ancient earthquake opened a crack that was widened through the erosive force of turbidity currents to become the present-day canyon.

Set in the 19th century, the object of the game is to explore the interior of  Africa , make an important discovery, and report it back to  European   civilization . The  explorers  must outfit their  expeditions  and choose a method of travel, be it  canoe ,  camel  or  foot . At the outset of the game the map of the interior of Africa is blank. As explorers enter each unexplored  hex , a card is drawn to determine the  terrain  and events, if any, that befall the explorers.  Crayons  are used to draw terrain on the map as it is discovered.   The explorers must confront  dangers  such as  starvation ,  disease ,  river cataracts  and hostile natives. The game is, in fact, highly lethal to explorers, but if a player loses an explorer he or she may create a new one who re-enters the game at a  coastal   port .   The player must choose a profession, and the amount of points a player gains for particular discoveries will vary depending on their choice. In particular:     Zoologists  get points for discovering animals.   Botanists  get points for discovering exotic plants.   Missionaries  get more points when dealing with natives.   Geologists  gain points for minerals.   Doctors  gain points for medicinal items.   Journalists  gain points for almost any encounter, even with other players.   Ethnologists  gain points for discovering native villages       [ edit ]   External links     Source of the Nile  at  BoardGameGeek             Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_of_the_Nile_(board_game) ""      Categories :  Historical board games  |  Avalon Hill games                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                                                   This page was last modified on 20 February 2009, at 05:30.

The very earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are a subject of some debate; it is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the  Upper Palaeolithic  era. From the Upper Palaeolithic through the  Mesolithic ,  cave paintings  and portable art like  figurines  and  beads  predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. In the Neolithic evidence of early  pottery  appeared, as did  sculpture  and the construction of  megaliths . Early  rock art  also first appeared in the Neolithic. The advent of  metalworking  in the  Bronze Age  brought another increase in mediums used for art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as  early writing systems . By the  Iron Age , civilizations with writing had arisen from  Ancient Egypt  to  Ancient China .   Many indigenous peoples from around the world continued to produce artistics works distinctive to their geographic area and culture, until exploration and commerce brought record-keeping methods to them. Some cultures, notably the  Maya civilization , independently developed writing during the time they flourished, which was then later lost. These cultures are generally considered prehistoric, especially if their writing systems have not been deciphered.

(November 2008)         [ edit ]   Earliest controversial finds   Unequivocal evidence of artistic expression is known only from the  Upper Palaeolithic , created by  Homo sapiens . However,  Homo erectus  had long before produced seemingly aimless patterns on artifacts such as is those found at  Bilzingsleben  in  Thuringia , and these might be understood as a precursor to art, as well as to reveal some intent of the artificer to decorate, to fashion beyond practical necessity. The symmetry and attention given to the shape of a tool has led authors to see  Middle Palaeolithic   hand axes  and especially  laurel points  as artistic expressions as well. A recent find,  the Mask of La Roche-Cotard  in  France , now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and more complicated artistic tradition.   The earliest possible artwork yet discovered, the  Venus of Tan-Tan  is claimed by the discoverer to have an age between 500,000 and 300,000 BCE, during the Middle  Acheulean  period. Discovered in  Morocco , it is about 6 centimeters long and resembles a human  figurine . [ 1 ]  Although this Moroccan artifact may have been created by natural  geological  processes, it appears to exhibit traces of human  tool -work and bears evidence of having been painted; iron and manganese particles consistent with ""manually applied paint residues"" were found on the stone's surface, indicating that it may have been decorated by someone and used as a figurine, regardless of how it may have been formed. The identity of the artifact as evidence of human artistic expression, however, remains disputed. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  A more or less comparable object from Israel, the  Venus of Berekhat Ram , dated to roughly 250,000 BCE, has elicited similar controversy. [ 3 ]   It remains premature, then, to claim with any degree of confidence that art existed before the  Upper Palaeolithic .     [ edit ]   Blombos Cave   In 2002 in  Blombos cave , situated in  South Africa , stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, suggesting to some researchers that  early Homo sapiens  were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. These impressive works date to 70,000 years ago, which makes them about 40,000 years older than the  Lascaux -type cave paintings. Other remarkable discoveries from the Blombos cave include shell beads 30,000 years older than previously-known beads. While the datings of the Blombos artifacts are correct, there is no indication that they are indeed actual representations of advanced cognitive behavior similar to the depictional art later in Europe. Several archaeologists including Richard Klein of  Stanford  are hesitant to accept the Blombos caves as the first example of actual art.     [ edit ]   Prehistoric arts of Asia   See also:  Eastern art history  and  History of Chinese art   Asia was the cradle for several significant civilizations, most notably those of  China  and  India . The prehistory of eastern Asia is especially interesting, as the relatively early introduction of writing and historical record-keeping in China has a notable impact on the immediately surrounding cultures and geographic areas.          A Korean Neolithic pot in the  National Museum of Korea , found in Busan, dated c. 3500 BCE         [ edit ]   Korea   See also:  Prehistoric Korea  and  List of archaeological periods (Korea)   The prehistory of Korean ends most definitively with the founding of the  Three Kingdoms of Korea , which are documented in a 12th-century CE Chinese text, the  Samguk Sagi  as beginning in the first century BCE. Mention of earlier history is made in other Chinese texts, like the third-century CE  Sanguo Zhi ; however, this section will focus on archaeological artistic finds up to the founding of the Three Kingdoms.   The earliest humans are estimated to have arrived in Korea somewhere between 400,000 and 100,000 years ago. [ 4 ]  As with most early human sites, the finds in the very oldest sites are generally of a utilitarian nature, and do not seem to feature artistic creativity to a notable degree. A cave at Turobong in South Korea containing human remains has been found to contain carved deer bones and depictions of deer that may be as much as 40,000 years old. [ 5 ]  Petroglyphs of deer or reindeer found at Sokchang-ri may also date to the Upper Paleolithic. Pot sherds in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on  Jeju island , which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Jeulmun period   Further information:  Jeulmun pottery period   Clearer evidence of culture became clearer in the late Neolithic, known in Korea as the  Jeulmun pottery period , with pottery similar to that found in the adjacent regions of China, decorated with Z-shaped patterns. The earliest Neolithic sites with pottery remains, for example Osan-ri, date to 60004500 BCE. [ 6 ]  This pottery is characterized by comb patterning, with the pot frequently having a pointed base. Ornaments from this time include masks made of shell, with notable finds at Tongsam-dong, Osan-ri, and Sinam-ri. Hand-shaped clay figurines have been found at Nongpo-dong. [ 7 ]          Large Middle Mumun (c. 800BCE) storage vessel unearthed from a pit-house in or near  Daepyeong         [ edit ]   Mumun period   Further information:  Mumun pottery period   During the  Mumun pottery period , roughly between 1500BCE and 300BCE, agriculture expanded, and evidence of larger-scale political structures became apparent, as villages became larger and some burials more elaborate. Megalithic tombs and  dolmens  throughout Korea date to this time. The pottery of the time is in a distinctive undecorated style. Many of these changes in style may have occurred due to immigration of new peoples from the north, although this is a subject of debate. [ 8 ]  At a number of sites in southern Korea there are rock art panels that are thought to date from this period, mainly for stylistic reasons. [ 9 ]   While the exact date of the introduction of bronzework into Korea is also a matter of debate, it is clear that bronze was being worked by about 700BCE. Finds include stylistically distinctive daggers, mirrors, and belt buckles, with evidence by the first century BCE of a widespread, locally distinctive, bronzeworking culture. [ 10 ]           Goguryeo tomb mural         [ edit ]   Protohistoric Korea   The time between 300BCE and the founding and stabilization of the Three Kingdoms around 300CE is characterized artistically and archaeologically by increasing trade with China and Japan, something that Chinese histories of the time corroborate. The expansionist Chinese invaded and established  commanderies  in northern Korea as early as the first century BCE; they were driven out by the 4th century CE. [ 11 ]  The remains of some of these, especially that of  Lelang , near modern  Pyongyang , have yielded many artifacts in a typical Han style. [ 12 ]   Chinese histories also record the beginnings of iron works in Korea in the first century BCE. Stoneware and  kiln -fired pottery also appears to date from this time, although there is controversy over the dates. [ 13 ]  Pottery of distinctly Japanese origin is found in Korea, and metalwork of Korean origin is found in northeastern China. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Prehistoric arts of Europe     [ edit ]   Upper Palaeolithic period           Aurochs  on a cave painting in  Lascaux ,  France .       Further depictional art is from the Upper Palaeolithic period (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) and includes both  cave painting  (such as the famous paintings at  Chauvet ,  Altamira ,  Pech Merle , and  Lascaux ),  portable art  (such as animal carvings and so-called  Venus figurines  like the  Venus of Willendorf ), and open air art (such as the monumental  Ca Valley  and  Mazouco  in  Portugal ,  Domingo Garca  and  Siega Verde , both in Spain,  Fornols-Haut  in  France ).          Venus of Willendorf               Drawing  of  bracelets  from  Mousterian  period (Mizyn site).       Later findings from the  Mizyn archeological site  in the  Ukraine  dated from  Mousterian  epoch of  Palaeolithic  are  mammoth   ivory  bracelets with carved  meander  ornaments. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Mesolithic period   The  Mesolithic  period has some examples of portable art, like painted pebbles ( Azilien ) from  Birseck , Eremitage in  Switzerland , and in some areas, like the  Spanish Levant , stylized rock art. Patterns on utilitarian objects, like the paddles from  Tybrind Vig ,  Denmark , are known as well.     [ edit ]   Neolithic period   According to archaeological evidence, the  Jmon  people in ancient  Japan  were the first to develop  pottery , dating to the  11th millennium BCE . The Jmon people were making clay figures and vessels decorated with patterns made by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks with a growing sophistication.   Free standing  sculpture  had already begun by the  Neolithic , the earliest being the anthropomorphic figurines, often embellished by animals from the very beginning of the Neolithic discovered in  Nevali Cori  and  Gbekli Tepe  near  Urfa  in eastern  Turkey , dating to ca.  10th millennium BCE . The Mesolithic statues of  Lepenski Vir  at the  Iron Gate ,  Serbia  date to the  7th millennium BCE  and represent either humans or mixtures of humans and fish.   In  Central Europe , many Neolithic cultures, like  Linearbandkeramic ,  Lengyel  and  Vina , produced female (rarely male) and animal statues that can be called art. Whether the elaborate pottery decoration of, for example, the  eliesovce  and painted  Lengyel  style are to be classified as art is a matter of definition.          Spread of megalithic architecture in western Europe       Megalithic  monuments are found in the Neolithic from  Malta  to  Portugal , through  France , and across southern  England  to most of  Wales  and  Ireland  They are also found in northern  Germany  and  Poland , as well as in Egypt in the  Sahara desert  (at  Nabata  and other sites). The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures on  Earth  are the  Megalithic Temples of Malta . They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots. Because of frequent re-use, this is difficult to prove. There are many sites for  rock and cave art of engraved animal and human scenes  in the Saharan area. Not as popular are the temples of Malta dating back to 3600 BCE these are the oldest free standing monuments in all the world with a post to lintel simple architecture but still very imposing structures. Many artistic similarities where found in Minoa (Crete) dating to the same period of the very well known Egyptian pyramids. While the best-known of these is  Stonehenge , where the main structures date from the early Bronze Age, such monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at  Carnac ,  France , at  Skara Brae  in the  Orkney Islands , in  Portugal , and in  Wiltshire ,  England , the area of Stonehenge, the  Avebury circle , the tombs at  West Kennet , and  Woodhenge . One tomb found in  Newgrange ,  Ireland , has its entrance marked with a massive stone carved with a complex design of spirals. The tomb of  Knowth  has rock-cut ornaments as well; one of them may be the oldest known image of the Moon. Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance. Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe.          Entrance stone with megalithic art at Newgrange       On the central Alps the civilization of the  Camunni  did 350.000 petroglyphs: see  rock Drawings in Valcamonica .     [ edit ]   Bronze Age          Three men performing a ritual,  Bohusln ,  Sweden       During the  3rd millennium BCE , however, the  Bronze Age  began in Europe, bringing with it a new medium for art. The increased efficiency of bronze tools also meant an increase in productivity, which led to a surplus  the first step in the creation of a class of artisans. Because of the increased wealth of society, luxury goods began to be created, especially decorated weapons. Examples include ceremonial bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as  lurer , and other ceremonial objects without a practical purpose.  Rock art , showing scenes from the daily life and religious rituals have been found in many areas, for example in  Bohusln   Sweden  and the  Val Camonica  in northern  Italy .     [ edit ]   Iron Age   The  Iron Age  saw the development of anthropomorphic sculptures, such as the  warrior of Hirschlanden , and the statue from the  Glauberg , Germany.  Hallstatt  artists in the early Iron Age favored geometric, abstract designs perhaps influenced by trade links with the Classical world.          A  1st century BC  mirror found in  Desborough ,  Northants , showing the spiral and trumpet theme.       The more elaborate and curvilinear  La Tne  artistic style developed in Europe in the later Iron Age from a centre in the  Rhine  valley but it soon spread across the continent. The rich chieftain classes appear to have encouraged ostentation and Classical influences such as bronze drinking vessels attest to a new fashion for wine drinking. Communal eating and drinking were an important part of  Celtic  society and culture and much of their art was often expressed through plates, knives,  cauldrons  and cups.  Horse tack  and weaponry were also subjects deemed fit for elaboration. Mythical animals were a common motif along with religious and natural subjects and their depiction is a mix between the naturalistic and the stylized.  Megalithic art  was still practiced, examples include the carved limestone pillars of the sanctuary at Entremont in modern day France. Personal adornment included  torc  necklaces whilst the introduction of  coinage  provided a further opportunity for artistic expression. Although the coins of this period are poorly made derivatives of Greek and Roman types, the more exuberant Celtic artistic style is still visible.   The famous late fourth century BCE  chariot burial  at  Waldalgesheim  in the  Rhineland  produced many fine examples of La Tne art including a bronze flagon and bronze plaques with  repouss  human figures. Many pieces had curvy, organic styles though to be derived from Classical tendril patterns.   In much of western Europe elements of this artistic style can be discerned surviving in the art and architecture of the Roman colonies. In areas where Roman influence was missing altogether, the later Iron Age artistic tradition continued well into the historic period, perhaps most famously in  Ireland  and  Northumbria .     [ edit ]   Prehistoric arts of Africa   The earliest alleged art object found in Africa is the  Venus of Tan-Tan  at 500,000-300,000BCE; however, this claim is controversial (see above).     [ edit ]   Early African rock art   The earliest undisputed African rock art dates back about 10,000 years. Rock carvings at the  Wonderwerk Cave  in  South Africa  have been dated to this age. [ 16 ]  Contentious dates as far back as 29,000 years have been obtained at a site in  Tanzania . A site at the Apollo 11 Cave complex in  Namibia  has been dated to 27,000 years. This site contains figures of animals painted on stone plaquettes that were carried to the site; the dating is of the sedimentary layers the plaquettes were found in, so the age of the artifacts themselves is somewhat uncertain. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Southern Africa   Artifacts related to the use of  pigments  have been dated to 125,000 years in  Zimbabwe . Stone palettes stained with pigments have been found that date to 40,000 years, and discarded pigments aged 125,000 have been found in waste piles. Zimbabwe's oldest art finds date to at least 10,000 years (again dated to sediment layers containing painted rock fragments). [ 17 ]  There is a significant body of rock painting in the region around  Matobo National Park  of Zimbabwe dating from as early as 6,000BCE to 500CE. [ 18 ]          A Bushman rock painting of an  eland  at  Drakensberg       Significant  bushman  rock paintings exist in the  Waterberg  area above the  Palala River  and around  Drakensberg  in South Africa, some of which are considered to derive from the period 8000 BCE. These images are very clear and depict a variety of human and  wildlife  motifs, especially  antelope . There appears to be a fairly continuous history of rock painting in this area; some of the art clearly dates into the 19th century. They include depictions of horses with riders, which were not introduced to the area until 1820s. [ 19 ]   Namibia, in addition to the Apollo 11 complex, has an significant array of Bushmen rock art near  Twyfelfontein . This work is several thousand years old, and appears to end with the arrival of pastoral tribes in the area. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   East Africa   Most of East African rock art is found on a plateau between the  Zambezi River  and the  Great Rift Valley . Running from southern  Kenya  and  Uganda  in the north, through Tanzania to  Zambia  and  Malawi  in the south, the rock art in this area is mostly paintings, although some engravings are found. It may never be known how early painting took place in this area, as the environment may well have destroyed the evidence. [ 21 ]  Most of the painting is of figures of animals and people, with some geometric shapes. Red paintings in Tanzania have been extensively studied, by the Leakeys ( Mary  and  Louis ) among others. [ 22 ]  White paintings in Zambia appear to date from about 2,000 years ago, with the arrival of  Bantu  speakers in the area, an observation confirmed by oral history of modern tribes in the area. [ 23 ]   In the  Horn of Africa  there are stone megaliths and engravings, some of which are 3,500 years old. Dillo in  Ethiopia  has a hilltop covered with stone  stelae , one of several such sites in southern Ethiopia dating from the 10th to the 14th century. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Saharan Africa   See also:  Saharan rock art          Rock carving of an elephant at  Tadrart Acacus       About 12,000 years ago, following the  last Ice Age , the Sahara region, which had been green prior to the Ice Age and desertified during it, again began to green, bringing large animals, as well as hunters. These hunters left stone tools (grinding stones, axes, and the like), and also left stone carvings of animals. The first naturalistic paintings of humans, dating back about 8,000 years, depict people with Negroid features. Pottery, apparently originating in the  Nile River  valley, spread as far west as  Mali  about 10,000 years ago. Noted sites containing early art include  Tassili n'Ajjer  in southern  Algeria ,  Tadrart Acacus  in  Libya  (A Unesco World Heritage site), and the  Tibesti Mountains  in northern  Chad . [ 25 ]   The early art of this region has been divided into five periods:     Bubalus Period, roughly 12-8 kya   Round Head Period, roughly 10-8 kya   Pastoral Period, roughly 7.5-4 kya   Horse Period, roughly 3-2 kya   Camel Period, 2,000 years ago to the present     Works of the Bubalus period span the Sahara, with the finest work, carvings of naturalistically depicted megafauna, concentrated in the central highlands. The Round Head Period is dominated by paintings of strangely-shaped human forms, and few animals, suggesting the artists were foragers. These works are largely limited to Tassili n'Ajjer and the  Akakus Mountains . Toward the end of the period, images of domesticated animals, as well as decorative clothing and headdresses appear. Pastoral Period art was more focused on domestic scenes, including herding and dancing. The quality of artwork declined, as figures became more simplified. [ 26 ]   The Horse Period began in the eastern Sahara and spread west. Depictions from this period include carvings and paintings of horses, chariots, and warriors with metal weapons, although there are also frequent depictions of wildlife such as giraffes. Humans are generally depicted in a stylized way. Some of the chariot art bears resemblance to temple carvings from ancient  Egypt . Occasionally, art panels are accompanied by  Tifinagh  script, still in use by the  Berber people  and the  Tuareg  today; however, modern Tuareg are generally unable to read these inscriptions. The final Camel period features carvings and paintings in which camels predominate, but also include humans with swords, and later, guns; the art of this time is relatively crude.

(December 2008)         [ edit ]   Prehistoric arts of South America   See also:  Pre-Columbian art   Humans have been documented to be living in  South America  for roughly 15,000 years; evidence of human habitation at  Monte Verde  in southern Chile, while still somewhat controversial, is difficult to dispute. [ 28 ]  Most early human sites in South America show evidence of stone tools, hearths, and other practical artifacts; clear evidence of artistic intents is not usually evident. The very earliest evidence of artistic endeavour does not appear for some time.          Stirrup-handled Cupinisque ceramic vase 1250BCE from the  Larco Museum         [ edit ]   Peru and the central Andes   See also:  Cultural periods of Peru  and  History of Peru   The prehistory of Peru and the central Andes is characterized by civilizations that very approximately alternate between the domination of highland cultures and that of coastal cultures. These periods of domination appear to correspond to significant changes in weather patterns (possibly influenced by  El Nio  events), principally the arrival or departure of drought conditions across some portion of the area. The timeline has been grouped into a system of  periods  and  horizons . Horizons were originally thought to be time periods in which single cultures tend to predominate in this area; periods were considered times when a diversity of more geographically dispersed cultures dominated. After this system was set up in the mid-20th century, later research has revealed that these divisions are not entirely straightforward. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Lithic and preceramic periods   Peru , including an area of the central  Andes  stretching from  Ecuador  to northern  Chile , has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating to roughly 10,000BCE. [ 30 ]  Prior to the emergence of ceramics in this region around 1850BCE, cave paintings and beads have been found. These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9,500BCE in the  Toquepala Caves . [ 31 ]  Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces. [ 32 ]   The earliest ceramics that appear in Peru may have been imported from the Validivia region; indigenous pottery production almost certainly arrived in the highlands around 1800BCE at Kotosh, and on the coast at La Florida circa 1700BCE. Older calabash gourd vessels with human faces burned into them were found at Huaca Prieta, a site dating to 2500-2000BCE. [ 33 ]  Huaca Prieta also contained some early patterned and dyed textiles made from twisted plant fibers. [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Initial Period and First Horizon   Further information:  Chavn culture          An image of the  Lanzn  deity on the great wall at  Chavn de Huantar , a First Horizon site       The Initial Period in Central Andean cultures lasted roughly from 1800BCE to 900BCE. Textiles from this time found at Huaca Prieta are of astonishing complexity, including images such as crabs whose claws transform into snakes, and double-headed birds. Many of these images are similar to  optical illusions , where which image dominates depends in part on which the viewer chooses to see. Other portable artwork from this time includes decorated mirrors, bone and shell jewelry, and unfired clay female effigies. [ 35 ]  Public architecture, including works estimated to require the movement of more than 100,000 tons of stone, are to be found at sites like Kotosh, El Paraso, and La Galgada. Kotosh, a site in the Andean highlands, is especially noted as the site of the Temple of the Crossed Hands, in which there are two reliefs of crossed forearms, one pair male, one pair female. [ 36 ]  Also of note is one of South America's largest ceremonial sites,  Sechn Alto . This site's crowning work is a twelve-story platform, with stones incised with military themes. [ 37 ]  The architecture and art of the highlands, in particular, laid down the groundwork for the rise of the  Chavn culture . [ 38 ]   The Chavn culture dominated the central Andes during the First Horizon, beginning around 900BCE, and is generally divided into two stages. The first, running until about 500BCE, represented a significant cultural unification of the highland and coastal cultures of the time. Imagery in all manner of art (textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and architectural) included sometimes fantastic imagery such as jaguars, snakes, and humananimal composites, much of it seemingly inspired by the jungles to the east. [ 39 ]   The later stage of the Chavn culture is primarily represented by a significant architectural expansion of the  Chavn de Huantar  site around 500BCE, accompanied by a set of stylistic changes. This expansion included, among other changes, over forty large stone heads, whose reconstructed positions represent a transformation from human to supernatural animal visages. Much of the other art at the complex from this time contains such supernatural imagery. [ 40 ]  The portable art associated with this time included sophisticated metalworking, including alloying of metals and soldering. [ 41 ]  Textiles found at sites like  Karwa  clearly depict Chavn cultural influences, [ 42 ]  and the  Cupisnique  style of pottery disseminated by the Chavn would set standards all across the region for later cultures. [ 43 ]  (The vessel pictured at the top of this article, while from the later  Moche  culture, is representative of the stirrup-spouted vessels of the Chavn.)          A Paracas Mantle dating from 200CE         [ edit ]   Early Intermediate Period   Further information:  Paracas culture ,  Nazca culture , and  Moche   The Early Intermediate Period lasted from about 200BCE to 600CE. Late in the First Horizon, the Chavn culture began to decline, and other cultures, predominantly in the coastal areas, began to develop. The earliest of these was the  Paracas culture , centered on the  Paracas peninsula  of central Peru. Active from 600BCE to 175BCE, their early work clearly shows Chavn influence, but a locally distinctive style and technique developed. It was characterized by technical and time-consuming detail work, visually colorful, and a profusion visual elements. Distinctive technical differences include painting on clay after firing, and embroidery on textiles. [ 44 ]  One notable find is a mantle that was clearly used for training purposes; it shows obvious indications of experts doing some of the weaving, interspersed with less technically proficient trainee work. [ 45 ]          The  Nazca line  figure known as The Dog       The  Nazca culture  of southern Peru, which is widely known for the enormous figures traced on the ground by the  Nazca lines  in southern Peru, shared some similarities with the Paracas culture, but techniques (and scale) differed. The Nazca painted their ceramics with  slip , and also painted their textiles. [ 46 ]  Nazca ceramics featured a wide variety of subjects, from the mundane to the fantastic, including utilitarian vessels and effigy figures. The Nazca also excelled at goldsmithing, and made  pan pipes  from clay in a style not unlike the pipes heard in music of the Andes today. [ 47 ]   The famous Nazca lines are accompanied by temple-like constructions (showing no sign of permanent habitation) and open plazas that presumably had ritual purposes related to the lines. The lines themselves are laid out on a sort of natural blackboard, where a thin layer of dark stone covers lighter stone; the lines were thus created by simply removing the top layer where desired, after using surveying techniques to lay out the design. [ 48 ]          Gold  Moche  headdress representing a  condor       In the north of Peru, the  Moche  culture dominated during this time. Also known as  Mochica  or  Early Chim , this warlike culture dominated the area until about 500CE, apparently using conquest to gain access to critical resources along the desert coast: arable land and water. Moche art is again notably distinctive, expressive and dynamic in a way that many other Andean cultures were not. Knowledge of the period has been notably expanded by finds like the pristine royal tombs at  Sipn . [ 49 ]   The Moche very obviously absorbed some elements of the Chavn culture, but also absorbed ideas from smaller nearby cultures that they assimilated, such as the Recuay and the Vics. [ 50 ]  They made fully-sculpted ceramic animal figures, worked gold, and wove textiles. The art often featured everyday images, but seemingly always with a ritual intent. [ 51 ]   In its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding  Wari  empire. The Cerro Blanco site of  Huaca del Sol  appears to have been the Moche capital. Largely destroyed by natural events around 600CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters. [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Middle Horizon          Ponce monolith in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple       The Middle Horizon lasted from 600CE to 1000CE, and was dominated by two cultures: the  Wari  and the  Tiwanaku . The Tiwanaku (also spelled  Tiahuanaco ) culture arose near  Lake Titicaca  (on the modern border between Peru and  Bolivia ), while the Wari culture arose in the southern highlands of Peru. Both cultures appear to have been influenced by the  Pukar  culture, which was active during the Early Intermediate in between the primary centers of the Wari and Tiwanaku. [ 53 ]  These cultures both had wide-ranging influence, and shared some common features in their portable art, but their monumental arts were somewhat distinctive. [ 54 ]   The monumental art of the Tiwanaku demonstrated technical prowess in stonework, including fine detailed reliefs, and monoliths such as the Ponce monolith (photo to the left), and the Sun Gate, both in the main Tiwanaku site. The portable art featured ""portrait vessels"", with figured heads on ceramic vessels, as well as natural imagery like jaguars and raptors. [ 55 ]  A full range of materials, from ceramics to textiles to wood, bone, and shell, were used in creative endeavours. Textiles with a weave of 300 threads per inch (80 threads per cm) have been found at Tiwanaku sites. [ 56 ]          The ruins of  Pikillacta , a  Wari  site       The Wari, dominated an area from central Peru to Ecuador, with their main center near  Ayacucho, Peru . Their art is distinguished from the Tiwanaku style by the use of bolder colors and patterns.  [ 57 ]  Notable among Wari finds are tapestry garments, presumed to be made for priests or rulers to wear, often bearing abstract geometric designs of significant complexity, but also bearing images of animals and figures. [ 58 ]  Wari ceramics, also of high technical quality, are similar in many ways to those of the preceding cultures, where local influences from fallen cultures, like the Moche, are still somewhat evident. Metalwork, while rarely found due to its desirability by looters, shows elegant simplicity and, once more, a high level of workmanship. [ 59 ]          Lambayeque (Sicn) metalworks from the  Larco Museum  in Lima, Peru.         [ edit ]   Late Intermediate Period   Following the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku, the northern and central coastal areas were somewhat dominated by the  Chim culture , which included notable subcultures like the  Lambayeque (or Sicn)  and  Chancay  cultures. To the south, coastal cultures dominated in the  Ica region , and there was a significant cultural crossroads at  Pachacamac , near Lima. [ 60 ]  These cultures would dominate from about 1000CE until the 1460s and 1470s, as the  Inca Empire  began to take shape and eventually absorbed the geographically smaller nearby cultures.   Chim and Sicn Cultures   Further information:  Chim culture  and  Sican Culture   The Chim culture in particular was responsible for an extremely large number of artworks. Its capital city,  Chan Chan , appears to have contained building that appeared to function as museumsthey seem to have been used for displaying and preserving artwork. Much of the artwork from Chan Chan in particular has been looted, some by the Spanish after the  Spanish conquest . [ 60 ]  The art from this time at times displays amazing complexity, with ""multimedia"" works that require artists working together in a diversity of media, including materials believed to have come from as far away as Central America. Items of increasing splendor or value were produced, apparently as the society became increasing stratified. [ 61 ]  At the same, the quality of some of the work declined, as demand for pieces pushed production rates up and values down. [ 62 ]          Sicn funerary mask,  Metropolitan Museum       The Sicn culture flourished from 700 to about 1400CE, although it came under political domination of the Chim around 1100CE, at which time many of its artists may have moved to Chan Chan. There was significant copperworking by the Sicn, including what seems to be a sort of currency based on copper objects that look like axes. [ 63 ]  Artwork includes burial masks, beakers and metal vessels that previous cultures traditionally made of clay. The metalwork of the Sicn was particularly sophisticated, with innovations including  repouss  and shell inlay. Sheet metal was also often used to cover other works. [ 64 ]   Prominent in Sicn iconography is the Sicn deity, which appears on all manner of work, from the portable to the monumental. Other imagery includes geometric and wave patterns, as well as scenes of fishing and shell diving. [ 65 ]   Chancay culture  Chancay culture, before it was subsumed by the Chim, did not feature notable monumental art. Ceramics and textiles were made, but the quality and skill level was uneven. Ceramics are generally black on white, and often suffer from flaws like poor firing, and drips of the slip used for color; however, fine examples exist. Textiles are overall of a higher quality, including the use of painted weaves and tapestry techniques, and were produced in large quantities. [ 66 ]  The color palette of the Chancay was not overly bold: golds, browns, white, and scarlet predominate. [ 67 ]   Pachacamac   Pachacamac  is a temple site south of  Lima, Peru  that was an important pilgrimage center into Spanish colonial times. The site boasts temple constructions from several periods, culminating in Inca constructions that are still in relatively good condition. The temples were painted with murals depicting plants and animals. The main temple contained a carved wooden sculpture akin to a  totem pole . [ 67 ]   Ica culture  The  Ica region , which had been dominated by the Nazca, was fragmented into several smaller political and culture groups. The pottery produced in this regions was of the highest quality at the time, and its aesthetics would be adopted by the Inca when they conquered the area. [ 68 ]          The  twelve angle stone , in the Hatum Rumiyoc street of  Cusco , is an example of Inca masonry.         [ edit ]   Late Horizon and Inca culture   Further information:  Inca architecture          An 1860 map of Cusco. The  puma  shape is discernible, with the head at the upper left and the tail at the lower right.       This time period represents the era in which the culture of the central Andes is almost completely dominated by the  Inca Empire , which began its expansion in 1438. It lasted until the  Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire  in 1533. The Inca absorbed much technical skill from the cultures they conquered, and disseminated it, along with standard shapes and patterns, throughout their area of influence, which extended from  Quito, Ecuador  to  Santiago, Chile . Inca stonework is notably proficient; giant stones are set so tightly without mortar that a knife blade will not fit in the gap. [ 69 ]  Many of the Inca's monumental structures deliberately echoed the natural environment around them; this is particularly evident in some of the structures at  Machu Picchu . [ 70 ]  The Inca laid the city of  Cusco  in the shape of a  puma , with the head of the puma at  Sacsayhuaman , [ 71 ]  a shape that is still discernible in aerial photographs of the city today.   The iconography of Inca art, while clearly drawing from its many predecessors, is still recognizably Inca. Bronzework owes a clear debt to the Chim, as do a number of cultural traditions: the finest goods were reserved to the rulers, who wore the finest textiles, and ate and drank from gold and silver vessels. [ 72 ]  As a result, Inca metalwork was relatively rare, and an obvious source of plunder for the conquering Spanish. Textiles were widely prized within the empire, in part as they were somewhat more portable in the far-flung empire. [ 73 ]          An Inca period tunic       Ceramics were made in large quantities, and, as with other media, in standardized shapes and patterns. One common shape is the  urpu , a distinctive urn shape that come in a wide variety of standard capacities, much as modern storage containers do. [ 74 ]  In spite of this standardization, many local areas retained some distinctive aspects of their culture in the works they produced; ceramics produced in areas under significant Chim control prior to the Inca rule still retain characteristics indicative of that style. [ 75 ]   Following the Spanish conquest, the art of the central Andes was significantly affected by the conflict and diseases brought by the Spanish. Early colonial period art, began to show influences of both Christianity and Inca religious and artistic ideas, and eventually also began to encompass new techniques brought by the conquerors, including oil painting on canvas. [ 76 ]     [ edit ]   Early ceramics in northern South America   See also:  Indigenous peoples in Colombia   The earliest evidence of decorated pottery in South America is to be found in two places. A variety of sites in the Santarm region of  Brazil  contain ceramic sherds dating to a period between 5000 and 3000BCE. [ 77 ]  Sites in  Colombia , at  Mons  and  San Jacinto  contained pottery finds in different styles, and date as far back as 3500BCE. [ 78 ]  This is an area of active research and subject to change. [ 79 ]  The ceramics were decorated with curvilinear incisions. Another ancient  site at Puerto Hormiga  in the  Bolvar Department  of  Colombia  dating to 3100BCE contained pottery fragments that included figured animals in a style related to later Barrancoid cultural finds Colombia and  Venezuela . [ 78 ]   Valdivia, Ecuador  also has a site dated to roughly 3100BCE containing decorated fragments, as well as figurines, many represent nude females. The Valdivian style stretched as far south as northern Peru, [ 80 ]  and may, according to Lavalle, yet yield older artifacts. [ 77 ]   By 2000BCE, pottery was evident in eastern Venezuela. The La Gruta style, often painted in red or white, included incised animal figures in the ceramic, as well as ceramic vessels shaped as animal effigies. The Rancho Peludo style of western Venezuela featured relativel simple textile-type decorations and incisions. [ 80 ]  Finds in the central Andes dating to 1800BCE and later appear to be derived from the Valdivian tradition of Ecuador. [ 81 ]     [ edit ]   Early art in eastern South America   See also:  Indigenous peoples in Brazil   Relatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes. This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a  jungle  environment that rapidly recycles organic materials. Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops. While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000BCE, [ 82 ]  and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age, ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts. The Mina civilization of Brazil (30001600BCE) had simple round vessels with a red wash, that were stylistic predecessors to later Bahia and Guyanan cultures. [ 80 ]     [ edit ]   Argentina, Chile, and Patagonia   The southern reaches of South America show evidence of human habitation as far back as 10,000BCE. A site at Arroio do Fosseis on the pampa in southern Brazil has shown reliable evidence to that time, [ 83 ]  and the  Tierra del Fuego  at the southern tip of the continent has been occupied since 7000BCE. [ 84 ]  Artistic finds are scarce; in some parts of Patagonia ceramics were never made, only being introduced by contact with Europeans. [ 85 ]     [ edit ]   Native arts of Oceania           Aboriginal  rock painting at  Namadgi National Park         [ edit ]   Australia   See also  Australian Aboriginal art   From earliest times, the natives of  Australia , often known as  Aborigines , have been creating distinctive patterns of art. Much of Aboriginal art is transitory, drawn in sand or on the human body to illustrate a place, an animal totem, or a tribal story. Early surviving artworks of the Aborigines are mostly rock paintings. Many are called  X-ray  paintings because they show the bones and organs of the animals they depict. Some Aboriginal art seems  abstract  to modern viewers; Aboriginal art often employs geometrical figures and lines to represent landscape, which is often shown from a birds-eye view. For instance, in Aboriginal  symbolism , a swirl stands for a watering hole.   The  Bradshaws  are a unique form of rock art found in  Western Australia . They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning. They have been dated at over 17,000 years old and debate rages as to who actually created them.     [ edit ]   Polynesia   The natives of  Polynesia  have a distinct artistic heritage. While many of their artifacts were made with organic materials and thus lost to history, some of their most striking achievements survive in clay and stone. Among these are numerous pottery fragments from western  Oceania , from the late  2nd millennium BCE . Also, the natives of Polynesia left scattered around their islands  Petroglyphs , stone platforms or  Marae , and sculptures of  ancestor figures , the most famous of which are the  Moai  of  Easter Island .

Yellowstone is the first and oldest  national park  in the world and covers 3,470 square miles ( 8,980 km/a>), mostly in the northwest corner of Wyoming. The park is famous for its various  geysers ,  hot springs , and  other geothermal features  and is home to  grizzly bears  and  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk . It is the core of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , one of the largest intact  temperate zone   ecosystems  remaining on the planet.   Long before any recorded  human  history in Yellowstone, a massive  volcanic eruption  spewed an immense volume of  ash  that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern  Mexico  and some areas of the eastern Pacific Coast. The eruption dwarfed that of  Mt. St. Helens  in  1980  and left a huge 70 kilometer long, 30 km wide  caldera  sitting over a huge magma chamber (see Geology section and  Yellowstone Caldera ).  Yellowstone typically erupts every 600,000 years with the last event occurring 640,000 years ago.  Its eruptions are the largest known to have ever occurred on Earth, producing drastic climate change in the aftermath. DNA evidence suggests the devastating results of these changes could have resulted in the worldwide population of humans falling to as little as 10,000 individuals.  The park was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  - a deep gash in the Yellowstone Plateau that was formed by floods during previous  ice ages  and by  river  erosion from the  Yellowstone River .      Contents     1 Human history   2 Geography   3 Geology   4 Biology and ecology   5 Tourist information   6 References   7 External links     Human history    The human history of the park dates back 12,000 years. It was known to the original natives as ""Mitzi-a-dazi,"" the ""River of Yellow Rocks,"" because of the hydrothermally-altered  iron -containing yellow rocks in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (many people incorrectly believe that the yellow color is from  sulfur ).  The Native Americans that hunted and fished in the Yellowstone region also utilized the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make cutting tools and weapons. In fact,  arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley  which strongly indicate that a regular obsidian trade  existed between Yellowstone Native Americans and tribes further east.         Lower Yellowstone Fall   In  1806  a member of the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  named  John Colter  left the Expedition to join a group of fur-trappers and was probably the first non-Native American to visit the region and make contact with the Native Americans there. After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with Crow and Blackfoot tribes he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium.    Mountain man  Jim Bridger  later returned from an  1857  expedition to the park's area and told tales of boiling springs, spouting water, a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored, however, because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns."" Nonetheless his stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist F.V. Hayden  who in  1859  started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region with Bridger as a guide and with  United States Army  surveyor W.F. Raynolds . The party was able to reach the approaches to the Yellowstone region but were not able to go any further due to heavy snows. The intervening  American Civil War  stopped all attempts to explore the region and Hayden would not be able to fulfill his mission to explore the area for another 11 years.         North Gate to Yellowstone Park at Gardiner, Montana which says ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People""   A party of  Montanans  then organized the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn . Amongst the group was  Nathaniel P. Langford  who would later become known as ""National Park"" Langford and an Army detachment commanded by Lt. Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month in  1870  exploring the region, collecting specimens and naming sites of interest.    In  1871  Hayden led a second, larger, expedition which was now government-sponsored to the Yellowstone region. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone which included photographs by W.H. Jackson  and paintings by  Thomas Moran . This report helped to convince the  U.S. Congress  to withdraw this region from public auction. Then on  March 1 ,  1872  President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park.    Langford then served for five years without pay as the first superintendent of the park and was followed by several other superintendents (who worked with some minimal funding). The second superintendent was  Philetus Norris  who essentially volunteered for the position, after traveling through Yellowstone and witnessing its problems first-hand. During his tenure Congress finally began to give the superintendent a salary and minimal funds to operate the park. He used these monies to expand access to and further explore Yellowstone. Norris also hired  Harry Yount  (nicknamed ""Rocky Mountain Harry"") to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the very first national park ranger.        Fort Yellowstone   Three additional superintendents followed, but none proved effective in stopping the destruction of Yellowstone's natural resources.  This continued until  1886  when the Army was given the task of managing the park (see Fort Yellowstone ). The Army remained the steward of the park until control was given to a civilian corps of rangers under the newly-created  National Park Service  in  1916 .    It was then made into an  International Biosphere Reserve  on  October 26 ,  1976  and a  World Heritage Site  on  September 8 ,  1978 .       Satellite map with political borders that shows the location of Yellowstone in an interesting manner: It is on fire. From 1988.   A series of  lightning -derived  fires  started to burn large portions of the park in  July  of the especially dry summer of  1988 . Thousands of  firefighters  responded to the blaze in order to prevent human-built structures from succumbing to the flames. Controversially, however, no serious effort was made to completely extinguish the fires and they burned until the arrival of autumn rains. Ecologists argued that fire is part of the Yellowstone  ecosystem  and that not allowing the fires to run their course (as has been the practice in the past) will result in a choked, sick and decaying forest. In fact, relatively few  megafauna  in the park were killed by the fires and since the blaze many saplings have sprung-up on their own, old vistas were viewable once again and many previously unknown archaeological and geological sites of interest were found and cataloged by scientists. The National Park Service now has a policy of lighting smaller, controlled, "" prescribed fires "" to prevent another dangerous build-up of flammable materials.  In  2003  notable changes occurred in thermal activity resulting in the closure of certain areas of the park.  Other findings included a bulge had appeared beneath  Yellowstone Lake .  On  March 10 ,  2004  a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which had inhaled an apparent release of toxic geothermal gases.  Shortly after in  April  of  2004  the park experienced an upsurge of earthquake activity.  Scientists are undecided on how to interpret these recent events.  The  United States  government responded by allocating more resources to monitor the caldera and asking visitors to remain on designated safe trails.    Geography    The  continental divide  of  North America  runs roughly diagonally through the south-western part of the park. The divide is a   topographic  ridgeline that bisects the continent between  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages (the drainage from one third of the park is on the Pacific side of this divide).          The Continental Divide passes through Yellowstone.   For example, the  Yellowstone River  and the  Snake River  both have their origin close to each other in the park. However, the headwaters of the Snake River are on the west side of the continental divide and the headwaters of the Yellowstone River are on the east side of that divide. The result is that the waters of the Snake River head toward the Pacific Ocean and the waters of the Yellowstone head for the Atlantic Ocean (via the  Gulf of Mexico ).      The park sits on a high  plateau  which is, on average, 8000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level  and is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the   Middle Rocky Mountains  which range from 10,000 to 14,000 feet (3,000 to 4,300 m) in elevation. These ranges are the; Gallatin Range  (to the north-west), Beartooth Mountains  (to the north),  Absaroka Mountains  (to the east), Southern Absaroka Mountains  (south-east corner),  Teton Mountains  (to the south - see  Grand Teton National Park ) and the Madison Range  (to the west). The most prominent summit in the plateau is Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).    Just outside of the south-western park border is the  Island Park Caldera  which is a plateau ringed by low hills. Beyond that is the  Snake River Plains  of southern  Idaho  which are covered by flood basalts  and slope gently to the south-west (see  Craters of the Moon National Monument ).     The major feature of the Yellowstone Plateau is the  Yellowstone Caldera ; a very large  caldera  which has been nearly filled-in with  volcanic  debris and measures about 60 km long by about 50 km wide (40 by 30 miles). Within this caldera lies most of  Yellowstone Lake  which is the largest high-elevation lake in North America and two resurgent domes  which are areas that are uplifting at a slightly faster rate than the rest of the plateau.       Geology         Columnar basalt near Tower Fall. Large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of super-heated ash and pumice.   Yellowstone is at the northeast tip of a smooth U-shaped curve through the mountains, which is now the  Snake River Plain .  This curved  plain  was created as the North American  continent  drifted across a stationary volcanic  hot spot  beneath the  Earth 's crust.  This hot spot used to be near what is now  Boise, Idaho , but North America has drifted at a rate of 4.5  centimetres  a year in a south western direction, shifting the hot spot to its present location.     Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in  North America .  It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the  caldera  was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. It was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago that released 1000  cubic kilometers  of  ash , rock and  pyroclastic  materials (this was 800 times larger than  Mount St. Helens '  1980  eruption), forming a  crater  nearly a  kilometre  deep and 70 by 40 km in size (45 by 25 miles) (the size of the caldera has been modified a bit since this time and has mostly been filled-in, however).  The  welded tuff   geologic formation  created by this eruption is called the Lava Creek Tuff . In addition to the last great eruptive cycle there were two other previous ones in the Yellowstone area.       Firehole River near Excelsior Geyser. The heat from the series of mega-eruptions continues to feed Yellowstone's many geysers, hot springs, and mud pots.   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially-emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material (usually through fissures that ring the caldera). The time between cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years but the small number of such climax eruptions can not be used to make a prediction for the time range for the next climax eruption.     The first and largest eruption, climaxed to the south west of the current park boundaries 2.2 million years ago and formed a caldera about 80 by 50 km in size (50 by 30 miles) and hundreds of metres deep after releasing 2,500 cubic kilometres of material (mostly ash,  pumice  and other pyroclastics). This caldera has been filled-in by subsequent eruptions and the geologic formation created by this eruption is called the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff . The second eruption, at 280 cubic km of material ejected, climaxed 1.2 million years ago and formed the much smaller  Island Park Caldera  and the geologic formation called the Mesa Falls Tuff . All three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America and fell many hundreds of miles away (as far as California to the southwest; see Lake Tecopa ). The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species in at least North America. About 160,000 years ago a much smaller climax eruption occurred which formed a relatively small caldera that is now filled-in with the West Thumb of  Yellowstone Lake .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone downstream from Lower Falls. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone was created by catastrophic ice-dam-break floods that exploited uplift-induced faults.    After the last major climax eruption 630,000 years ago until about 70,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled-in with periodic eruptions of   rhyolitic  lavas (example at Obsidian Cliffs ) and  basaltic  lavas (example at Sheepeaters Cliff ). But 150,000 years ago the floor of the plateau began to bulge-up again. Two areas in particular at the foci of the elliptically-shaped caldera are raising faster than the rest of the plateau. This differential in uplift has created two resurgent domes  (Sour Creek dome  and Mallard Lake dome ) which are uplifting at 15  millimetres  a year while the rest of the caldera area of the plateau is uplifting at 12.5 mm/yr.      Preserved within Yellowstone are many  geothermal  features and some 10,000  hot springs  and  geysers , 62% of the planet's known total. The super-heated water that sustains these features comes from the same hot spot described above. The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser  (located in Upper Geyser Basin) but the park also contains the largest geyser in the world,  Steamboat Geyser  (in Norris Geyser Basin; see  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ).      Biology and ecology   Main articles :  Animals of Yellowstone ,  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem        Map showing the ranges of the re-introduced packs   A controversial aspect of the park is the recent re-introduction of  wolves  into the park's ecosystem. For many years the wolves were hunted and harassed until they become locally extinct in the 1930s. The smaller cousin of the wolf, the  coyote , then became the top predator of the park. However the coyote is not able to bring down any large animal in the park and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna. Since the reintroduction of wolves in the late 1990s this trend has started to reverse. However, there is still fear among surrounding  cattle  ranchers and other livestock ranchers that the wolves will venture out of the park and prey on the much easier to kill domesticated animals. In fact this happens occasionally but the ranchers are compensated for their losses whenever they can prove that Yellowstone wolves were the cause of the livestock loss. The ranchers contend that it is difficult to prove that coyotes or wild dogs were the responsible parties. However, the  endangered species  status of introduced wolf packs has also been controversially suspended which makes it possible for ranchers to shoot and kill wolves that come close to their herds.        Bison graze near a hot spring   The relatively large  American Bison  (buffalo) populations that exist in the park are also a concern for ranchers who fear that the bison can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to  North America  with  European  cattle and may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to a visitor or to domestic livestock has ever been filed. But since the possibility of contagion still exists, the State of Montana believes its ""brucellosis-free"" status may be jeopardized if bison are in proximity to cattle.  Elk  also carry the disease, but this popular game species is not considered a threat to livestock.   To combat the perceived threat, National Park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of park borders.  Animal rights  activists state that is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists also point out that the bison are just traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing (most of these areas are also within  United States National Forests ).    Tourist information      Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the US.  The park is unique in that it features multiple natural wonders all in the same park.  You can find geysers, hot springs, a grand canyon, forests, wilderness, wildlife and even a large lake inside the park. Due to the diversity of the features in the park, the list of activities for visitors is nearly endless. From backpacking to mountaineering, from  kayaking  to  fishing , from sightseeing to watching bison,  moose , and  elk  wandering into the parking lot of the visitor centers, most visitors enjoy a memorable experience in nature.  Due to the geothermal activities of the park, the odor of sulfur is common around the park.  Visitors with respiratory difficulties should consult their doctors before visiting.  Wildland fire is common in the park.  One major wildfire in 1988 burnt down much of the forest in the park.  It would be wise to check the status of the park before planning a trip.  Yellowstone also advises visitors not to approach dangerous animals and to stay on designated safe trails to avoid falling into boiling liquids and inhaling toxic gas.  In 2004, five bison were discovered dead from an apparent inhalation of toxic geothermal gases.   Visitors may stay right in the park, with a clear view of  Old Faithful Geyser , at the park's  Old Faithful Inn  or in any of the many designated camping areas.

clueweb09-en0003-01-26789	"   Frequently asked questions about recent findings at Yellowstone Lake           Recent articles in the press reported a ""bulge"" beneath Yellowstone Lake and have generated some concern about possible dangers for residents or visitors to the area. Below, we answer some questions we've been asked by the public and press.                                  New high-resolution bathymetric relief map of Yellowstone Lake, acquired by multibeam sonar imaging and seismic mapping, surrounded by colored geologic map of the area around Yellowstone Lake. From  Morgan et al. (2003, in press) .                                     Is there a bulge beneath the lake?                       Why was it called the ""inflated plain""?                       Has the ""inflated plain"" been growing?                       So what's the big deal?                       What's a hydrothermal explosion?                       Do any of the features beneath the lake relate to possible volcanic eruptions?                       Is there any possibility of a toxic gas emission from Lake Yellowstone as occurred in Africa some years ago?                       Is anybody assessing the hazards from new hydrothermal explosions?                                  Is there a bulge beneath the lake?     Mapping of the lake bottom has revealed a variety of faults, hot springs and craters beneath Yellowstone Lake. In a recent scientific report (Morgan et al., 2003), one feature was informally named the ""inflated plain"" by USGS researcher Lisa Morgan, who organized surveys of the lake beginning in 1999. In mapping the entire lake, she and her colleagues identified a region about 2,000 feet long that rises about 100 feet above the lake floor. The area is in the northern part of Yellowstone Lake, south-southwest of Storm Point. The area is home to many hot springs and the nearby sediments have undergone chemical changes (alteration) due to the flow of thermal water.     Why was it called the ""inflated plain""?     Seismic images of the lake sediments in this area show that they were tilted, hinting that the region may have been pushed up or ""inflated."" The amount of inflation would be much less than the 100-foot height of the feature, but is currently unknown. The images appear to indicate that the uplift is associated with accumulation of gas from Yellowstone's hydrothermal (hot water) system. Similar inferred gas accumulations were also noted elsewhere within the lake. Future research will assess the amount of uplift and its origin, whether by gas buildup or other potential mechanisms.     Has the ""inflated plain"" been growing?     At present, there is no evidence of recent growth of any features beneath the lake, and there is no indication that residents or visitors are in any danger. Temperature measurements from hydrothermal vents taken this year indicate no change in temperatures compared to those taken last year. The feature may have been there for decades or much longer.     So what's the big deal?     There may be none. This region has active hydrothermal features, and possibly some uplift. It's possible that the area could host future hydrothermal explosions, but so could other areas beneath the lake and other areas within the Park.     What's a hydrothermal explosion?     Hydrothermal explosions occur when water that feeds Yellowstone's geysers and hot springs is explosively flashed to steam, breaking rocks and throwing them into the air. Small hydrothermal explosion events occur every few years at Yellowstone, mostly in the geyser basins, and usually pose little hazard. There is geologic evidence for a few large hydrothermal explosions, some leaving craters thousands of feet across near Yellowstone Lake and in other areas of the park. Such large explosions have not occurred within the last several thousand years. Two classic papers discuss evidence for hydrothermal explosions at Yellowstone, both in the geyser basins (Muffler et al., 1971) and beneath Mary Bay in Yellowstone Lake (Wold et al., 1977).     Do any of the features beneath the lake relate to possible volcanic eruptions?     It is very unlikely. All active features are related to faults and hot water (hydrothermal) vents. Identified craters were formed by collapse or as a result of old hydrothermal explosions. Many of the rocks beneath the lake are lava flows more than 100,000 years old.     Is there any possibility of a toxic gas emission from Lake Yellowstone as occurred in Africa some years ago?     No. What occurred in Cameroon (Lake Nyos in 1986) resulted from CO 2  buildup in the bottom waters of a tropical lake. In warm climates, lakes easily become stratified. In cold climates, however, the waters of lakes ""turn over"" once or twice per year. Cold water from melting ice sinks to the bottom of the lake. This creates a well-mixed lake with minimal potential for gas buildup. In addition, the CO 2  at Lake Nyos was cold and not associated with thermal water. Waters and gases from the hot vents beneath Lake Yellowstone will tend to rise through the lake due to their low density.     Is anybody assessing the hazards from new hydrothermal explosions?     A geologic hazard assessment of Yellowstone National Park is underway by YVO. The assessment will evaluate the known and potential hazards at Yellowstone from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hydrothermal explosions. Any new information on Yellowstone Lake will be made available to YNP officials and the general public.       References:         Morgan, L.A., Shanks, W.C.

Home  »  Wild Travels  » Yellowstone National Park           Yellowstone National Park         Many people feel that Yellowstone is the single greatest National Park in the country. And there is little doubt that their opinion is valid.   Yellowstone is filled top to bottom and side to side one of the broadest array of  natural wonders  in close proximity to each other than anywhere else in the world.   Geysers, Springs, geological sites, pristine wilderness and a rich and lengthy history are just a few of the attractions that can be seen in Yellowstone, along with over 1100 miles of trails and a history that is open for your perusal and dates back over 12000 years.   Yellowstone National Park - Old Faithful Geyser   Endless broad acres of pristine wilderness that would take literally years to traverse await you in the Park. Yellowstone became the first and oldest National Park in the world by an act of Congress made on March 1st in 1872, and was dedicated by the President of the United States, “dedicated and set apart as a public park, or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people and for preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, wonder and their retention in natural condition.   The amazing features that led to the interest in and preservation of Yellowstone as a natural park were primarily geological. The geothermal phenomena, including geysers and hot springs here are more numerous in this small area than those which exist in the rest of the world.   Including the wonders viewable here are the very colorful and interesting  Grand Canyon  of the Yellowstone River as well as fossil forests and the elevation and grand size of the Yellowstone Lake. Yellowstone Caldera, a 28- by 47 mile cone of a collapsed volcano which last erupted about 500,000 years ago are also well worth seeing.   The park’s geysers, hot mud pots, fumaroles (vents of steam) and hot springs are kept bubbling by an underground pressure cooker of sorts that is filled with magma. One geophysicist described Yellowstone as “a window to the earth’s interior.”   The human history of the park as stated previously dates back nearly 12000 years, however it is a minimal part of the parks overall attractiveness. Over 99% of the park itself remains completely undeveloped, which accounts for about 3400 square miles of wilderness waiting to be explored.   One of the North American continents largest and most diverse mammal population ever gathered in one place exists in Yellowstone Park. It is a true wilderness, with nearly the entire original park lands dedicated remaining as they were at the time of its dedication, where you can meet nature on her own terms. A month is not long enough to view all that’s here. IN fact a year is probably not lengthy enough to see all of the attractions that exist in this area.   The Primary human inhabitants were the Shoshone Indians, who found all that they needed to survive in the land surrounding this area.. Buffalo and sheep were the main dietary sources here and also provided clothing and blankets for the indigenous peoples.   They left many signs of themselves in and around the park. The valleys that are part of Yellowstone provided what was a natural corridor to the great herds of buffalo in Montana. This became a major trail, called the Bannock trail that was used by the Indians. The natives lived a primarily modest lifestyle, unaffected by the advent of the arrival of white settlers. They were without horses and metal when the first trappers came upon them in the early part of the 19th century.   The first white people to meet the Shoshone were two trappers, Joseph Dixon and Forrest Hanock. And Discovery Corp member Colter, who spend the winter near the mouth of the Clarks fork River. As spring began to come to the surrounding lands they met a soldier named Manual Lisa, who talked Colter into building a trading post near the mouth of the Big Horn.   Yellowstone National Park - Winter Scene   “The Yellowstone Area is one of great seismic and volcanic activity. Many scientists believe there was once a hotspot beneath Yellowstone, the same type of geological process that has formed the Hawaiian Islands.   Yellowstone has erupted violently three times in its history, the most recent having occurred approximately 600,000 years ago. The magma chamber spewed its contents into the air and onto the earth’s surface; eventually the overlying material collapsed into the empty chamber, forming a gigantic caldera measuring approximately 45 miles by 30 miles and was several thousand feet deep. Molten lava soon oozed through cracks in the earth and filled in the caldera. This caldera now makes up nearly one third of the park.   Hayden did the first geological survey of the area in 1871. He was among the first to note that the area was a centerpiece for volcanic activity and also noted the frequent occurrence of small to moderate magnitude earthquakes. In 1959, the largest intermountain region earthquake in recorded history shook the area with 7.5 magnitude jolt. While the Yellowstone region makes up less than 0.1% of the continental US, it releases nearly 5% of the total thermo-energy of the United States.”   Yellowstone’s weather is unpredictable. A sunny warm day may become stormy with wind, rain, sleet and even snow. Lightning storms are common. During these storms, get off water and away from beaches, and stay away from ridges, exposed places and isolated trees.   Yellowstone National Park - Illustration   Attractions:   Back Basin  The huge, though infrequent, Steamboat Geyser is one of the attractions at Back Basin, a big geyser area. Steamboat only performs about once a year but when it does, it shoots 300 feet into the air.   Mammoth  Hot Springs  At this hot springs, you’ll find multicolored travertine terraces formed by slowly flowing hot mineral water. Grazing nearby, elk are frequent visitors.   Midway Geyser Basin  The Grand Prismatic Spring and Excelsior Geyser Crater are two of the features at Midway, which has some beautiful, richly colored, “bottomless” pools.   Norris Geyser Basin  The hottest and oldest such basin in Yellowstone, Norris Geyser Basin is constantly changing. Some geysers or hot springs might suddenly stop flowing, but others blow and hiss into life. Among the features at Norris are Whirligig Geyser, Whale’s Mouth, Emerald Spring and Arch Steam Vent.   Old Faithful  The long-standing centerpiece of Yellowstone is Old Faithful. The mysterious plumbing of Yellowstone has lengthened Old Faithful’s eruption cycle somewhat in recent years, but the geyser still spouts the same amount of water, sometimes reaching to 140 feet, and pleases spectators every 80 minutes or so. Sometimes it doesn’t shoot so high, but in those cases the eruption lasts longer.   Upper Geyser Basin   Marked trails and bridges lead to Geyser Hill and you can visit Castle Geyser and Morning Glory Pool as well as the Giantess Geyser and Giant Geyser. Elk and buffalo commonly share the area. In winter, cross-country ski trails converge at Old Faithful.   Porcelain Basin  This basin is a small geyser area and a 1 mile boardwalk. A lot of people visit here, but it’s a good place to watch the ground bulge from underground pressure.   West Thumb  A small geyser basin and views of Lake Yellowstone are worth stopping for at West Thumb, which also has a visitor center and a warming hut if you’re here in winter.   Yellowstone Lake  Sitting in the bowl of a 600,000 year old volcanic caldera, Yellowstone Lake is a wild and mysterious phenomenon. You can boat and fish in Yellowstone Lake or simply sit along the shore and watch the waves. In the winter, you will sometimes see otters and coyotes, on the ice at lake’s edge.   Yellowstone National Park - Gray Wolf   Activities:   Biking  Many visitors tour parts of the park by bicycle every year, despite the fact that Yellowstone’s roads are typically narrow, rough and without shoulders. Some 300 miles of roadway are available to bicyclists, but bikes are prohibited on trails and in the back country. Blacktail Deer Plateau Road, near Mammoth, allows two-way bike and one-way auto traffic. Bicyclists face stiff climbs at Craig Pass, between Old Faithful and West Thumb; Sylvan Pass, between the East entrance and Fishing Bridge; and Dunraven Pass, north of Canyon.   Hiking  There are 1,210 miles of trails and 85 trailheads in Yellowstone. Don’t be surprised to find some trails closed temporarily due to weather conditions or bear activity. For more information on specific areas of the park, contact the visitor center in that area.   Paddling  Boating is allowed on Yellowstone and other lakes, but you must have a permit. Yellowstone Lake is subject to sudden high winds and its waters are extremely cold.   Winter Sports  During the winter, there are unlimited places for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Start at Old Faithful, the easy Lone Star Geyser Trail passes thermal areas and links to several other trails ranging from easy to difficult. The Riverside Trail starting at the west entrance follows the Madison River and involves one traverse up a short, steep hill. The Canyon area has trails for beginner to intermediate skiers with some awe-inspiring rim side views, as well as dangerous switchbacks for advanced skiers only. Downhill skiers can head to the slopes in Jackson Hole.   In The Area:   Craters of the Moon National Monument  The Craters of the Moon Lava Field covers 618 square miles and is the largest young basaltic lava field in the lower 48 states. Established in 1924, Craters of the Moon National Monument preserves 83 square miles of it for the enjoyment of present and future generations. The park contains more than 20 volcanic cones including outstanding examples of spatter cones. There are 60 different lava flows on the surface and they range in age from 15,000 to just 2,000 years old.   National Elk Refuge  The National Elk Refuge, on the southern border of Grand Teton National Park, provides a winter home to nearly 7,500 elk. Late in October and early in November when snow comes to the high country, elk begin their traditional migration from their summer range in the Tetons and Yellowstone to the winter range in the valley. The heavy snows forcing the animals to lower elevations in search of food. Elk stay on the Refuge for about six months. In winter, horse-drawn sleigh rides are available to take visitors for a close-up look at the elk herd.

The park is on  Camelback Mountain  and is maintained jointly by the  Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources  and Camelback Ski Corporation.   From the summit of the mountain, one has a view of vast portions of eastern Pennsylvania as well as parts of  New Jersey  and  New York . A paved drive, 1.4 miles (2.3 km) in length, around the summit provides visitors with a view in all directions. Visitors can see the  Delaware Water Gap  from this location.   The park, except for the  Camelback Ski Area , closes for the winter seven days following the end of  deer  season in December and reopens as conditions permit in the spring.           Contents       1   History   2   Facilities and recreation   3   Nearby state parks   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   The land on which Big Pocono State Park is situated was owned by Henry S. Cattell at the turn of the 20th century. Knowing of the fondness that others in the area shared with him for the view that the summit provided, Cattell constructed a stone cabin there in 1908. For many years the cabin was left unlocked so that anyone who wished to use it as a shelter, could. [ 2 ]   The Pennsylvania Game Commission purchased the land in 1928, 12 years following the death of Cattell. In 1950, the state leased a portion of the land on the north slope to Big Pocono Skiing, Inc., for commercial development. The company was later renamed the Camelback Ski Corporation, and the facility is now a major  ski resort . [ 2 ]   In 1953, the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (now the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) acquired 1,306 acres (529 ha) of state game lands, which comprised the land that was purchased by the Game Commission, including the ski area lease, and the area immediately around the summit. [ 2 ]   Big Pocono State Park opened to the public in 1954, following the construction of facilities and the scenic driver around the summit. The Cattell Cabin served as a park office and a nature museum for many years. [ 2 ]   Although the museum no longer exists, the stone cabin still stands and is paramount only to the great views one can obtain by going to the different observation points provided by both DCNR and the Camelback Ski Corporation. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Facilities and recreation   Big Pocono State Park offers a hiking trail system that consists of 7 miles (11 km) of interconnecting trails. The trails are of varying terrain and grade, and park officials caution inexperienced hikers to inquire at the park office before attempting the steep and rocky North Trail. [ 2 ]   In addition to the hiking trails, there is also a horseback riding trail (3 miles (4.8 km)). The trailhead is near the entrance of the park, on the west end. [ 2 ]   Three picnic areas with a total of 50 tables are situated within the park. The picnic area adjacent to Cattell Cabin has tables in an open setting, and the east and south picnic areas are in a wooded setting. [ 2 ]          Skiing on Camelback Mountain       The  Camelback Ski Area , located on the north slope, boasts the largest  skiing ,  snowboarding  and snowtubing facility in the  Pocono Mountains . The facility has 33 trails, 13 lifts, two terrain parks, detachable quads, a  halfpipe , night skiing and 100% snowmaking. The ski area also operates the Cameltop restaurant, which is located near the summit and is open from  Memorial Day  to  Columbus Day . In the summertime, a waterpark named  Camelbeach  is operated on the grounds of Camelback, and this can be seen from Big Pocono. [ 2 ]   Hunting  is permitted in designated areas of the park during hunting seasons.

It is located in the northwest corner of  Wyoming  extending into portions of  Montana  and  Idaho . The major features of the caldera measure about 55 kilometers (34 mi) by 72 kilometers (45 mi) as determined by  geological  field work conducted by Bob Christiansen of the  United States Geological Survey  in the 1960s and 1970s. After a BBC television science program coined the term  supervolcano  in 2000, it has often been referred to as the ""Yellowstone supervolcano.""

While the  Yellowstone hotspot  is now under the  Yellowstone Plateau , it previously helped create the eastern  Snake River Plain  (to the west of Yellowstone) through a series of huge  volcanic eruptions . Although the hotspot's apparent motion is to the east-northeast, the  North American Plate  is really moving west-southwest over the stationary hotspot deep underneath. [ 3 ]   Over the past 17 million years or so, this hotspot has generated a succession of violent eruptions and less violent  floods of basaltic lava . Together these eruptions have helped create the eastern part of the  Snake River Plain  from a once-mountainous region. At least a dozen or so of these eruptions were so massive that they are classified as  supereruptions . Volcanic eruptions sometimes empty their stores of  magma  so fast that they cause the overlying land to collapse into the emptied  magma chamber , forming a geographic depression called a  caldera . Calderas formed from explosive supereruptions can be as wide and deep as mid- to large-sized lakes and can be responsible for destroying large parts of mountain ranges.   The oldest identified caldera remnant straddles the border near  McDermitt, Nevada-Oregon . Progressively younger caldera remnants, most grouped in several overlapping volcanic fields, extend from the Nevada-Oregon border through the eastern Snake River Plain and terminate in the Yellowstone Plateau. 142 or more caldera-forming eruptions have occurred from the Yellowstone hotspot within the past 17 million years. [ 4 ]          Yellowstone sits on top of three overlapping calderas. (USGS)       The loosely-defined term ' supervolcano ' has been used to describe volcanic fields that produce exceptionally-large volcanic eruptions. Thus defined, the Yellowstone Supervolcano is the volcanic field which produced the latest three supereruptions from the Yellowstone hotspot. The three supereruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago; forming the  Island Park Caldera , the  Henry's Fork Caldera , and Yellowstone calderas, respectively [ 5 ] . The  Island Park Caldera  supereruption that produced the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  was the largest and produced 2,500 times as much ash as the  1980 Mount St. Helens eruption . The second largest supereruption formed the Yellowstone Caldera and produced the  Lava Creek Tuff . The  Henry's Fork Caldera  produced the smaller  Mesa Falls Tuff  but is the only caldera from the SRPY hotspot that is plainly visible today. [ 6 ]   Non-explosive eruptions of  lava  and less violent explosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since the last supereruption. The most recent lava flow occurred about 70,000 years ago while the largest violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake Yellowstone around 150,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well; an explosion 13,800 years ago left a 5 kilometer diameter  crater  at Mary Bay on the edge of  Yellowstone Lake  (located in the center of the caldera). [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  Currently, volcanic activity is exhibited only via numerous  geothermal vents  scattered throughout the region, including the famous  Old Faithful Geyser .   The volcanic eruptions, as well as the continuing geothermal activity, are a result of a large chamber of magma located below the caldera's surface. The magma in this chamber contains gases that are kept dissolved only by the immense pressure that the magma is under. If the pressure is released to a sufficient degree by some geological shift, then some of the gases bubble out and cause the magma to expand. This can cause a runaway reaction. If the expansion results in further relief of pressure, for example, by blowing crust material off the top of the chamber, the result is a very large gas explosion.     [ edit ]   Earthquakes             This section documents a  current event .  Information may change rapidly as the event progresses.       Due to the volcanic and tectonic nature of the region, the Yellowstone Caldera experiences between 1000 and 2000 measurable  earthquakes  a year, though most are relatively minor, measuring a magnitude of 3 or less. Occasionally, numerous earthquakes are detected over a short period of time, an event known as an  earthquake swarm . In 1985, more than 3000 earthquakes were measured over several months. More than 70 smaller swarms have been detected between 1983 and 2008. The USGS states that these swarms are not caused by movements of magma, but are related to movements of  hydrothermal  fluids. [ 9 ]  The most recent swarm occurred in December 2008 and continued into January 2009, with more than 500 quakes detected under the northwest end of  Yellowstone Lake  over a seven day span, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.9. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Volcanic hazards   The last full-scale eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano, the  Lava Creek  eruption which happened approximately 640,000 years ago [ 14 ] , ejected approximately 240 cubic miles (1000 cubic kilometres) of rock and dust into the sky. [ 8 ]   Geologists are closely monitoring the rise and fall of the  Yellowstone Plateau , which averages 0.6 inches (about 1.5 cm) yearly, as an indication of changes in magma chamber pressure. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   The upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor  almost 3 inches (7 centimeters) per year for the past three years  is more than three times greater than ever observed since such measurements began in 1923. [ 17 ]  From mid-Summer 2004 through mid-Summer 2008, the land surface within the caldera has moved upwards, as much as 8 inches at the White Lake GPS station. [ 18 ]  The U.S. Geological Survey, University of Utah and National Park Service scientists with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory ""see no evidence that another such cataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future. Recurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable."". [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Hydrothermal explosion hazard   Studies and analysis may indicate that the greater hazard comes from hydrothermal activity which occurs independently of volcanic activity. Over 20 large craters have been produced in the past 14,000 years since the glaciers retreated from Yellowstone, resulting in such features as Mary Bay, Turbid Lake and Indian Pond.   Lisa Morgan, a USGS researcher, explored this threat in a 2003 report, and in a recent talk postulated that an earthquake may have displaced more than 77 million cubic feet (2,200,000 m 3 ) (576,000,000 US gallons) of water in Yellowstone Lake, creating huge waves that essentially unsealed a capped geothermal system leading into the hydrothermal explosion that formed Mary Bay. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]   Further research shows that earthquakes from great distances do reach and have effects upon the activities at Yellowstone, such as the 1992 7.3 magnitude  Landers earthquake  in Californias Mojave Desert that triggered a swarm of quakes from more than 800 miles (1,300 km) away and the Denali fault earthquake 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away in Alaska that altered the activity of many geysers and hot springs for several months afterwards. [ 21 ]   The head of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, Jake Lowenstern, has proposed major upgrades and extended monitoring since the U.S. Geological Survey classified Yellowstone as a high-threat system. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Origin          Path of the Yellowstone hot spot over the past 15 million years       The source of the  Yellowstone hotspot  is controversial. Some  geoscientists  hypothesize that the Yellowstone hotspot is the effect of an interaction between local conditions in the  lithosphere  and  upper mantle convection . [ 23 ] [ 24 ]  Others prefer a deep mantle origin ( mantle plume ). [ 25 ]  Part of the controversy is due to the relatively sudden appearance of the hotspot in the geologic record. Additionally, the  Columbia Basalt flows  appeared at the same approximate time, causing speculation about their origin.

The states of  Washington  and  Oregon  are to the west,  Nevada  and  Utah  are to the south, and  Montana  and  Wyoming  are to the east. Idaho also shares a short border (48 miles (77 km)) with the Canadian province of  British Columbia  to the north. The landscape is rugged with some of the largest unspoiled natural areas in the United States. It is a  Rocky Mountain  state with abundant natural resources and scenic areas. The state has snow-capped mountain ranges, rapids, vast lakes and steep canyons. The waters of  Snake River  rush through  Hells Canyon , the deepest canyon in the United States.  Shoshone Falls  plunges down rugged cliffs from a height greater than that of  Niagara Falls . The major rivers in Idaho are the  Snake River , the  Clark Fork / Pend Oreille River , the  Clearwater River  and the  Salmon River . Other significant rivers include the  Coeur d'Alene / Spokane River , the  Boise River  and the  Payette River . The Port of  Lewiston , at the confluence of the  Clearwater  and the  Snake  Rivers is the farthest inland seaport in the Pacific Northwest.   Idaho's highest point is  Borah Peak , 12,662 ft (3,859 m), in the  Lost River Range  north of  Mackay . Idaho's lowest point, 745 ft (227 m), is in  Lewiston , where the  Clearwater River  joins the  Snake River  and continues into  Washington . The  Sawtooth Range  is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range.

Areas north of the  Salmon River , including  Coeur d'Alene ,  Moscow ,  Lewiston , and  Sandpoint  are in the  Pacific Time Zone  and revolve commercially and culturally around  Spokane, Washington     [ edit ]   Climate   Idaho has much variation in its climate. Although the state's western border is located about 350 miles (560 km) from the Pacific Ocean, the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho, especially in the winter when cloud cover,  humidity , and  precipitation  are at their highest points. This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with a mostly elevated altitude. The maritime influence is lowest in the southeastern part of the state where the precipitation patterns are often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences more extreme, showing a more continental climate.   Climate  in Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over 100 F (38 C) for the maximum temperature are rare. Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since, for most of the state, the highest  diurnal  difference in temperature is often in the summer. Winters can be cold, although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual.       Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Idaho Cities.

Excavations at  Wilson Butte Cave  near  Twin Falls  in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in  North America .  Native American  tribes predominant in the area included the  Nez Perce  in the north and the Northern and Western  Shoshone  in the south.   Idaho, as part of the  Oregon Country , was claimed by both the United States and  Great Britain  until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. Between then and the creation of the  Idaho Territory  in 1863, parts of the present-day state were included in the  Oregon ,  Washington , and  Dakota  Territories. The new territory included most of present-day Idaho,  Montana , and  Wyoming . The first organized communities, within the present borders of Idaho, were established in 1860. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   After some tribulation as a territory, including the chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from  Lewiston  to  Boise ,  disenfranchisement  of  Mormon   polygamist   [ 7 ]  and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory and the state of  Nevada , Idaho achieved statehood in 1890. The economy of the state, which had been primarily supported by metal mining, shifted towards  agriculture  and  tourism .   In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined. [ 8 ]   The  Idaho State Historical Society  preserves and promotes Idahos cultural heritage.     [ edit ]   Origin of name          Lake Coeur d'Alene in North Idaho.       Idaho is the only state that was possibly named as the result of a  hoax  (the so-called ""Idahoax"") although this is disputed. In the early 1860s, when the  United States Congress  was considering organizing a new territory in the  Rocky Mountains , eccentric lobbyist  George M. Willing  suggested the name ""Idaho,"" which he claimed was derived from a  Shoshone language  term meaning ""the sun comes from the mountains"" or ""gem of the mountains."" Willing later claimed that he had made up the name himself [3] [4] . Congress ultimately decided to name the area  Colorado Territory  when it was created in February 1861.   However, the name ""Idaho"" did not go away. The same year Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called  Idaho County  was created in eastern  Washington Territory . The county was named after a  steamship  named  Idaho , which was launched on the  Columbia River  in 1860. It is unclear whether the steamship was named before or after Willing's claim was revealed. Regardless, a portion of Washington Territory, including Idaho County, was used to create Idaho Territory in 1863.   Despite this lack of evidence for the origin of the name, many textbooks well into the 20th century repeated as fact Willing's account that the name ""Idaho"" derived from the Shoshone term ""ee-da-how"".     An excerpt from an Idaho History Textbook:   ""Idaho"" is a Shoshoni Indian exclamation. The word consists of three parts. The first is ""Ee"", which in English conveys the idea of ""coming down"". The second is ""dah"" which is the Shoshoni stem or root for both ""sun"" and ""mountain"". The third syllable, ""how"", denotes the exclamation and stands for just the same thing in Indian that the exclamation mark (!) does in the English language. The Shoshoni word is ""Ee-dah-how"", and the Indian thought thus conveyed when translated into English means, ""Behold! the sun coming down the mountain"".    ""IDAHO in the Pacific Northwest"". Barber -Martin. 1956. Caxton Printers Ltd. Library of Congress 55-5192.         Chief Joseph Seltice, of the Coeur d'Alene Tribal Nation, posits another possible origin of the name. In his history of the tribe,  Saga of the Coeur d'Alene Indians , he writes:     Some sources claim that the name ""Idaho"" comes from an Indian word, ""Ee-dah-how,"" meaning ""Gem of the Mountains."" This expression may have come from some other Tribe, and it would have a different meaning for them than it would for the Coeur d'Alenes.  As the Coeur d'Alenes understood the word ""Idaho,"" it would be more correctly pronounced ""Ah-d'Hoo."" It means ""greetings by surprise,"" indicating friendship, but surprise.  The first syllable conveys to the mind, ""All are welcome, from wherever you come; but keep the friendly peace. We welcome you with out-stretched arms, and this entitles us to permanent friendship.""  The last syllable is a surprise and exclamation point. The expression means that all are welcome, ""though we are surprised to see so many different strangers. The first dawn of day welcomes you as the sun rises."" This expression was used by many of the Coeur d'Alenes on the Bitterroot Mountains to greet all who come.  So to all who read these words: ""Welcome, with open arms! We're just surprised that there are so many of you!""

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 people (that is 111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to net  migration  of 75,795 people into the state.  Immigration  from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 61,273 people.   This made Idaho the sixth  fastest-growing state  after  Arizona ,  Nevada ,  Florida ,  Georgia , and  Utah . From 2004 to 2005, Idaho grew the third-fastest, surpassed only by Nevada and Arizona.   Nampa , the state's second largest city, has experienced particularly strong growth in recent years. According to census estimates Nampa has grown 22.1% to nearly 65,000 residents between 2000 and 2003. As of 2007, the population in  Nampa  was estimated at 84,000. Growth of 5% or more over the same period has also been observed in  Caldwell ,  Coeur d'Alene ,  Meridian ,  Post Falls  and  Twin Falls . [5]   Since 1990, Idaho's population has increased by 386,000 (38%).   The  Boise Metropolitan Area  (officially known as the Boise City-Nampa, ID Metropolitan Statistical Area) is Idaho's largest metropolitan area. Other metropolitan areas in order of size are  Coeur d'Alene ,  Idaho Falls ,  Pocatello  and  Lewiston .   As of 2006, six official  micropolitan statistical areas  are based in Idaho. Twin Falls is the largest of these.   The  center of population  of Idaho is located in  Custer County , in the town of  Stanley .

Historical poster of Yellowstone from 1938       Yellowstone National Park , established by the  U.S. Congress [ 3 ]  as a  national park  on March 1, 1872, is located primarily in the  U.S. state  of  Wyoming , though it also extends into  Montana  and  Idaho . The park was the first of its kind, and is known for its  wildlife  and  its many geothermal features , especially  Old Faithful Geyser , one of the most popular features in the park. [ 1 ]  It has many types of  ecosystems , but the  subalpine   forest  is dominant.   Aboriginal Americans  have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by  mountain men  during the early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The  U.S. Army  was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the  National Park Service , which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.   Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468 square miles (8,983 km), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and  mountain ranges . [ 1 ]   Yellowstone Lake  is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the  Yellowstone Caldera , the largest  supervolcano  on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. [ 4 ]   Lava  flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the largest remaining, nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. [ 5 ]   Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either  endangered  or  threatened . [ 1 ]  The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Grizzlies ,  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk  live in the park.  Forest fires  occur in the park each year; in the  large forest fires  of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including  hiking ,  camping ,  boating ,  fishing  and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either  snow coaches  or  snowmobile .

Near the end of the eighteenth century,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the 1950s, an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.

Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]    The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstonenote the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology       Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano              Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology       Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem               Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Fauna       Main articles:  Animals of Yellowstone  and  Wolf reintroduction               Bison  graze near a hot spring       Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest  megafauna  wildlife habitat in the  lower 48 states . There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. After a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna. Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires     See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988             Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5C C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation       Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park       Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park              Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.

clueweb09-en0006-74-20162	              Evoscience                 About                                   Evoscience      Science news                      Home      Contact      Sitemap                             Yellowstone Volcano Inflating With Molten Rock At Record Rate             The Yellowstone “supervolcano” rose at a record rate since mid-2004, likely because a Los Angeles-sized, pancake-shaped blob of molten rock was injected 6 miles beneath the slumbering giant, University of Utah scientists report in the journal Science.   “There is no evidence of an imminent volcanic eruption or hydrothermal explosion. That’s the bottom line,” says seismologist Robert B. Smith, lead author of the study and professor of geophysics at the University of Utah. “A lot of calderas [giant volcanic craters] worldwide go up and down over decades without erupting.”    The upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor — almost 3 inches (7 centimeters) per year for the past three years — is more than three times greater than ever observed since such measurements began in 1923, says the study in the Nov. 9 issue of Science by Smith, geophysics postdoctoral associate Wu-Lung Chang and colleagues.   “Our best evidence is that the crustal magma chamber is filling with molten rock,” Smith says. “But we have no idea how long this process goes on before there either is an eruption or the inflow of molten rock stops and the caldera deflates again,” he adds.   The magma chamber beneath Yellowstone National Park is a not a chamber of molten rock, but a sponge-like body with molten rock between areas of hot, solid rock.   Chang, the study’s first author, says: “To say if there will be a magma [molten rock] eruption or hydrothermal [hot water] eruption, we need more independent data.”   Calderas such as Yellowstone, California’s Long Valley (site of the Mammoth Lakes ski area) and Italy’s Campi Flegrei (near Naples) huff upward and puff downward repeatedly for decades to tens of thousands of years without catastrophic eruptions.   Smith and Chang conducted the study with University of Utah geophysics doctoral students Jamie M. Farrell and Christine Puskas, and with geophysicist Charles Wicks, of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.   Yellowstone: A Gigantic Volcano Atop a Hotspot   Yellowstone is North America’s largest volcanic field, produced by a “hotspot” — a gigantic plume of hot and molten rock — that begins at least 400 miles beneath Earth’s surface and rises to 30 miles underground, where it widens to about 300 miles across. There, blobs of magma or molten rock occasionally break off from the top of the plume, and rise farther, resupplying the magma chamber beneath the Yellowstone caldera.   Previous research indicates the magma chamber begins about 5 miles beneath Yellowstone and extends down to a depth of at least 10 miles. Its heat powers Yellowstone’s geysers and hot springs — the world’s largest hydrothermal field.   As Earth’s crust moved southwest over the Yellowstone hotspot during the past 16.5 million years, it produced more than 140 cataclysmic explosions known as caldera eruptions, the largest but rarest volcanic eruptions known. Remnants of ancient calderas reveal the eruptions began at the Oregon-Idaho-Nevada border some 16.5 million years ago, then moved progressively northeast across what is now the Snake River Plain.   The hotspot arrived under the Yellowstone area sometime after about 4 million years ago, producing gargantuan eruptions there 2 million, 1.3 million and 642,000 years ago. These eruptions were 2,500, 280 and 1,000 times bigger, respectively, than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The eruptions covered as much as half the continental United States with inches to feet of volcanic ash.   The most recent giant eruption created the 40-mile-by-25-mile oval-shaped Yellowstone caldera. The caldera walls have eroded away in many areas — although they remain visible in the northwest portion of the park. Yellowstone Lake sits roughly half inside and half outside the eroded caldera. Many smaller volcanic eruptions occurred at Yellowstone between and since the three big blasts, most recently 70,000 years ago. Smaller steam and hot water explosions have been more frequent and more recent.   Measuring a Volcano Getting Pumped Up   In the new study, the scientists measured uplift of the Yellowstone caldera from July 2004 through the end of 2006 with two techniques:      Twelve Global Positioning System (GPS) ground stations that receive timed signals from satellites, making it possible to measure ground uplift precisely.    The European Space Agency’s Envisat satellite, which bounces radar waves off the Yellowstone caldera’s floor, another way to measure elevation change.     The measurements showed that from mid-2004 through 2006, the Yellowstone caldera floor rose as fast as 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) per year — and by a total of 7 inches (18 centimeters) during the 30-month period, Chang says.   “The uplift is still going on today but at a little slower rate,” says Smith, adding there is no way to know when it will stop.   Smith says the fastest rate of uplift previously observed at Yellowstone was about 0.8 inch (2 centimeters) per year between 1976 and 1985.   He says that Yellowstone’s recent upward motion may seem small, but is twice as fast as the average rate of horizontal movement along California’s San Andreas fault.   The current uplift is faster than ever observed at Yellowstone, but may not be the fastest ever, since humans weren’t around for its three supervolcano eruptions.   Chang, Smith and colleagues conducted computer simulations to determine what changes in shape of the underground magma chamber best explained the recent uplift.   The simulations or “modeling” suggested the molten rock injected since mid-2004 is a nearly horizontal slab — known to geologists as a sill — that rests about 6 miles (10 kilometers) beneath Yellowstone National Park. The slab sits within and near the top of the pre-existing magma chamber, which resembles two anvil-shaped blobs expanding upward from a common base.   Smith describes the slab’s computer-simulated shape as “kind of like a mattress” about 38 miles long and 12 miles wide, but only tens or hundreds of yards thick.   In reality, he believes the slab resembles a large, spongy pancake formed as molten rock injected from below spread out near the top of the magma chamber.   The pancake of molten rock has an area of about 463 square miles, compared with 469 square miles of land for the City of Los Angeles.   Smith and colleagues believe steam and hot water contribute to uplift of the Yellowstone caldera, particularly during some previous episodes, but evidence indicates molten rock is responsible for most of the current uplift.   Chang says that when rising molten rock reaches the top of the magma chamber, it starts to crystallize and solidify, releasing hot water and gases, pressuring the magma chamber. But gases and steam compress more easily than molten rock, so much greater volumes would be required to explain the volcano’s inflation, the researchers say.   Also, large volumes of steam and hot water usually are no deeper than 2 miles, so they are unlikely to be inflating the magma chamber 6 miles underground, Smith adds.   Ups and Downs at Yellowstone   Conventional surveying of Yellowstone began in 1923. Measurements showed the caldera floor rose 40 inches during 1923-1984, and then fell 8 inches during 1985-1995.   GPS data showed the Yellowstone caldera floor sank 4.4 inches during 1987-1995. From 1995 to 2000, the caldera rose again, but the uplift was greatest — 3 inches — at Norris Geyser Basin, just outside the caldera’s northwest rim.   During 2000-2003, the northwest area rose another 1.4 inches, but the caldera floor itself sank about 1.1 inches. The trend continued during the first half of 2004. Then, in July 2004, the caldera floor began its rapid rate of uplift, followed three months later by sinking of the Norris area that continued until mid-2006.   Smith believes that uplift of the middle of the caldera decreased pressure within rocks along the edges of the giant crater, “so it allowed fluids to flow into the area of increased porosity.” That, in turn, triggered small earthquakes along the edge of the “pancake” of magma. The amount of hot water flowing out of the deflated Norris area is much smaller than the volume of magma injected beneath the caldera, Smith says.   http://www.utah.edu/            09 Nov 07 |  Earth - Climate                             Leave a Reply           Name (required)      Mail (will not be published) (required)      Website                                                                                       Categories         Computers - Math      Earth - Climate      Fossils - Ruins      Health - Medicine      Matter - Energy      Plants - Animals      Science Products      Space - Time         Related Links       Rhinoplasty Cincinnati       Fast Life Insurance       Circuit Breaker       Custom Term Paper       Online Auctions       malignant mesothelioma       Buy LED Lighting & Save Energy       Celebrity Pictures       Genital Warts       Medical Alarm - Medical Alarms       Medical translation services            Recent Posts             Canon CF-1 Digital Retinal Camera          Yellowstone Volcano Inflating With Molten Rock At Record Rate          New Species Of Peccary - Pig-like Animal - Discovered In Amazon Region          Divers Find New Species In Aleutians          New Insights Into How Natural Antioxidants Fight Fat              Popular Posts Right Now   Yellowstone Volcano Inflating With Molten Rock At Record Rate Breastfeeding Boost IQ In Infants With 'Helpful' Genetic Variant New Species Of Peccary - Pig-like Animal - Discovered In Amazon Region Canon CF-1 Digital Retinal Camera New Insights Into How Natural Antioxidants Fight Fat Energy Drink 'Cocktails' Lead To Increased Injury Risk, Study Shows                                       Blogroll      ABNet   Inacod   Joomla Tribune   Joomlactive   Mambodyssee   SBGadget   Strikemobile         Tags abdominal holes   ages   astronomers   atmosphere   Blue Mountain   Bonn   breathable   Chlamydia   death   Diet   Disaster   Discover   Emergency Medical Response   females   Genes   hospital   inter-sex   Klamath   life   Lifestyle Changes   Mice   Mineral   newborns   origin   Ovulatory Disorders   Prevent Infertility   psoriasis   Related Mechanisms   Replicate   Research   researchers   risk   rocks   Sierra Nevadas   simulate   smoking   Species   study   Survival   Triage Study   Trigger   understand   universe   Vaginal reconstruction   Virus Mimicry           ©  Evoscience  ·  RSS Feed      Design by  Luka Cvrk  · Wordpressed by  Ericulous  ·  Inacod  ·  Wordpress Themes

Historical poster of Yellowstone from 1938       Yellowstone National Park , established by the  U.S. Congress [ 3 ]  as a  national park  on March 1, 1872, is located primarily in the  U.S. state  of  Wyoming , though it also extends into  Montana  and  Idaho . The park was the first of its kind, and is known for its  wildlife  and  its many geothermal features , especially  Old Faithful Geyser , one of the most popular features in the park. [ 1 ]  It has many types of  ecosystems , but the  subalpine   forest  is dominant.   Aboriginal Americans  have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by  mountain men  during the early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The  U.S. Army  was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the  National Park Service , which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.   Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468 square miles (8,983 km), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and  mountain ranges . [ 1 ]   Yellowstone Lake  is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the  Yellowstone Caldera , the largest  supervolcano  on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. [ 4 ]   Lava  flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the largest remaining, nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. [ 5 ]   Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either  endangered  or  threatened . [ 1 ]  The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Grizzlies ,  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk  live in the park.  Forest fires  occur in the park each year; in the  large forest fires  of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including  hiking ,  camping ,  boating ,  fishing  and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either  snow coaches  or  snowmobile .

Near the end of the  18th century ,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the  1950s , an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the  Lewis and Clark Expedition , left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.     [ edit ]   Geography          Yellowstone Lake on an autumn morning              Map of Wyoming showing the Yellowstone National Park       Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]           Madison River .       The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Note the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology   Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano          Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology   Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem           Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive.

There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]  After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires   See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988           Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5 C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation   Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park   Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park          Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.

""I am advising all State officials around        Yellowstone National Park for a potential State of Emergency.  In the last        week over 252 earthquakes have been observed by the USGS.  We have a 3D        view on the movement of magma rising underground.  We have all of the pre        warning signs of a major eruption from a super volcano.  - I want everyone        to leave Yellowstone National Park and for 200 miles around the volcano        caldera.""

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED BEFORE!!!!     ESA satellite reveals Yellowstone's deep secret   Satellite images acquired by ESA's ERS-2 revealed the recently discovered changes in Yellowstone's caldera are the result of molten rock movement 15 kilometres below the Earth's surface, according to a recent study published in Nature.   Using Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry, InSAR for short, Charles Wicks, Wayne Thatcher and other U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists mapped the changes in the northern rim of the caldera, or crater, and discovered it had risen about 13 centimetres from 1997 to 2003.   InSAR, a sophisticated version of 'spot the difference', involves mathematically combining different radar images, acquired from as near as possible to the same point in space at different times, to create digital elevation models and reveal otherwise undetectable changes occurring between image acquisitions.   ""We know now how mobile and restless the Yellowstone caldera actually is. Ground-based measurements can be more efficiently deployed because of our work,"" Thatcher said. ""The research could not have been done without satellite radar data.""

St. Helens' (1980), Phillipines - Mt. Pinatubo (1991), Hawaii,         and Central America.  The film was very well done with real science         interspersed into the fictionalized future scenario.                The scenario was based on the real 2003 heat up         of the Norris Geyser at Yellowstone and the fact that it has been shown         that the land is raising over time.  Norris Basin itself has raised         5 inches, and the entire Caldera has raised 35 inches since 1923.               It is also known that one end of Yellowstone         Lake is 100 feet higher than it used to be and flooding the land at the         other end and killing the trees.  Trees in various parts of the         park are dying because their roots are cooking from the heat under the         ground.  Bison have died from gas coming out of the holes in the         ground.                  Water is now boiling along the trails.         Some people have fallen into this water and been severely injured. Some         paths are now closed.                 In the film, they told people that there         might be an imminent small eruption and they should prepare for 3 days         of being home, and then evacuated all the people from 100 miles around         the caldera.                In reality, if there is an eruption,         larger than Mt. St. Helens, we would need at least a year's worth of         supplies because no food could be grown, farm lands would be useless,         temperatures would drop by as much as 15 degrees. Within 3 months, the         entire world would be covered by clouds.                Millions of people would die - most         within the surrounding 100 miles - fewer people would die from inhalation of ash         as it spreads mostly east and south from the caldera in widening circles         around the area. 600 miles from the         caldera is not safe at all.                 FEMA could not handle this big an event.         The U.S. economy would come to a halt.  Grocery stores would empty         out, airlines, trains, buses, and roads would stop.                 Though at the end of the film, during the         last half hour, Tom Brokaw and workers at Yellowstone Park tried to make         it seem like nothing is going to happen, it is already known that the         scientists who are monitoring what is going on at Yellowstone is being         withheld from the public.                The real truth is,   WILL NOT BE TOLD HOW         BIG OR HOW BAD AN ERUPTION CAN BE , and the last word by the Yellowstone         worker was, ""Come and visit Yellowstone and see how it really         is.""                 This is probably a good idea -         people 'should' go see what is going on.  Don't just go there and         see how pretty all the steam and water is that is shooting up out of the         ground. Find out the real science of the area and how it is         changing.                       Yellowstone - Mystery, Intrigue & Planted Sensors     508  EARTHQUAKE SWARM IN APRIL, 2004         LATEST NEWS       YELLOWSTONE EXPLOSION COMPARISONS     Its worse than we are being told                         Excerpt from:  http://www.syzygyjob.net/dreams/messages/39393.shtml           Then Menno asks if we will be struck soon by that meteor an angel         had told him           about years ago. This angel said no, not that one. Then, I saw a meteor         hit the           earth and the angel said, it will strike in the ocean near Yukatuk,         Alaska. It will           cause a tidal wave all up and down the west coast. It will trigger the         volcano in           Yellowstone. Then I saw the volcano with dark, gray, billowing smoke         rising up           out of it. Menno asks me if I was sure it was Yellowstone. I asked him         if he ever           saw Yellowstone's volcano. He said yes.                    I said okay, this is what I am seeing. I see a volcano, that is not as         high as say           Mount Rainer, Mount Baker. It kind of slopes to a peak and it has no         snow on it,           it is all brown. Menno said, well that's what it looks like alright. So,         he asks if it           will blow right away and the angel said No, but within 3 -3 1/2months         after it starts           billowing this smoke. Then Menno asks, if we had understanding right         about Rev.18,           that Babylon is US (New York City). The angel said partly right. He         said, when           New York gets destroyed, it will escalate things in Iraq and Babylon         there will also           be destroyed. Then, world events will start to unfold.                             David Booth - proven psychic- had a vision in March of 2003.  He  saw himself in space,   looking down on the earth. He saw a dark, planetary object coming from the  south end   of earth - out of the southern Hemisphere.  As this planetary object  came past earth,    the size of which would fit between the earth and the moon - he saw the western  end of    the U.S. blow up with fire and blasts of smoke and ash.  From there,  the whole earth    rippled.  Yellowstone had blown up.       Gordon Michael Scallion (psychic)- on March 16, 2003 - had a vision that  two lightbeings    showed him that Wyoming and Utah were glowing red.  The lightbeings  said, ""This will    change the world in 18 months.""  (18 months from March 16, 2003 = September,  2004)       From:   jmccanneyscience.com       March 23, 2004 7PM CST special emergency update ...  word just came in from a private    contact that there will be a major news announcement tonight regarding  Yellowstone    National Park ... to be released by one of the major networks ... initial  UNCONFIRMED    reports indicate that the volcanic bubble under Yellowstone's basin has raised  over 100    feet in the past day and there are indications it is ready to blow ... i  repeat these are    UNCONFIRMED reports that have come to me through what i consider reliable  sources       and therefore am posting so you can watch for the official announcement ...  if this is true    then it is clear this has been known about for some time and the USGS page  is as we have    said a total misinformation site about the seriousness of Yellowstone and  the evacuation    preparations that should have been underway LONG ago  ... jim  mccanney        David Booth and Wayne Green were kicked off of the   Coasttocoastam.com  show  on    3-18-04 for not revealing what the Nun (Sister Lucy) who gave the Fatima  prophecies had    said to him in a private meeting.  David DID say that it was said, ""The  New Star will soon    shine.""  which refers to Wormwood and the book of Revelation:                 CHERNOBYL IS UKRAINIAN FOR WORMWOOD               I will will mention the aquatic dog. Canis Major and Minor are the      ""dog""        constellations, and Sirius is the Dog Star. In the Greek myths, these are      the        dogs that accompany the Hunter, Orion. Sirius and Orion in the      Egyptian        system are, of course, Isis and Osiris who produce Horus; i.e. a      Trinity.        I have theorized that the following Nostadamus quatrain, C2, Q41, is      related:                     The great star will burn for seven days,    The cloud will make the sun appear double:    The large mastiff will howl all night    When the great pontiff changes his abode.                               The ""large mastiff"" in the theory is Canis Major/Sirius/Isis, which      corresponds        to the Woman With Child in Revelation 12. This is speaking of dreams,      visions,        inspirations, etc., the communication from the collective unconscious at      the end        of the cycle. Signposts/ guideposts are left for us in the waking state ""on      land""        by way of coincidences and synchronicities.               But, to notice them, we need to stay awake.       Howling all day and night, I remain, your spiritual brother,       Joe Mason   Hunter, assisted by two aquatic dogs       NOTE: Comets are frequently responsible for causing weather anomalies  like El Nino and   earthquakes and volcanoes to explode.   Several comets are coming this  year, and will be    seen by the naked eye beginning in May. By September, Venus (the morning  Daybreak star)    crosses the face of the sun.    These are the two  suns.                        December 17, 2003 - DREAM (implanted in my head after I heard a         bell ring in my ear:           There were 2 puzzles on the floor  -one with small pieces and         1 with large pieces. These had           to be put together before we could leave.           So, I did the large pieced puzzle. It was of the United States.         The right half of the U.S. was           divided from the left half, at the Mississippi River.           So, I pulled the right half over to the left half and stuck them         together.  Missouri         was a large           Teddy Bear . Wyoming had a train locomotive with smoke coming out of         its stack and was           lower than the other pieces like there was a layer missing.           (Wyoming is where Yellowstone is)           See:  http://www.earthmountainview.com/yellowstone/yellowstone.htm           I finished up my part of the cleaning and left to go home. On the         way, it was like I was flying           over the roadway and all the traffic was going East and people were in a         panic and passing           each other in their hurry. I saw two cars crash and roll end over end. I         stopped to access the           crash and damage and I watched, along with other people as the car         repaired itself into a           picture like a house until it looked better than brand new. It was         amazing to watch.                                                 Prophetic Vision of Yellowstone Volcano                     March 16, 2007          Diane M.                     To  Holly  Deyo :                     I have been told to share this with you by spirit. Your work has been so          meaningful to                       me  I hope this is useful          for you and Stan.                    I had a prophetic vision come to me the middle of February. Since then,          I have had more          parts of the vision filled in on almost a daily basis. My          vision was significant volcanic          activity in Yellowstone National Park,  on March 17          2007.  Although it is shown to me          as a large eruption, it does not devastate mankind. The eruption is          bigger than Mount           Saint Helens. Even though all of the signs are there, the eruption          catches  people          off guard.                    The Eastern Part of the United States is effected from the ash, and          there is some          civil unrest, but not too much because people cannot           be out in the ash. Most of the          civil unrest is surrounded with people trying to get supplies.                     Colorado is somewhat affected, but not devastated. California          escapes most of the          effect. Although, there is some crop failure, most citizens of the          United States will          continue to have access to sufficient food.                     However, the world will feel the effects,          since the United States  will not be able to export          any significant quantities of food. The parts of the world that are          already suffering from           food shortages will get worse. This event will start the beginning of a          period of  food          shortages.                     In the vision I was shown that although several catastrophic events have          already           happened, this event is to serve as a wake up call, so that people can          prepare for the           even rougher road ahead.                           See:   http://www.whatdoesitmean.com   See:  James McCanney and the Comets  See:   Earthquake predictions for the month  See:   http://www.drsky.com/     Asteroid Toutatis arriving in September   What else is coming? -  two comets  See:   http://www.greatdreams.com/lostland/pole2.htm  See:   http://www.greatdreams.com/1950DA.htm  See:  http://www.greatdreams.com/1998ox4.htm   See:   http://www.greatdreams.com/disaster-dreams.htm   See:   Venus transition - June 8, 2004   See:  Wormwood in the Bible Code     SEE:   QUAKE WATCHLIST AND INFORMATION         See:   Bible Code 1   -   Bible Code 2   -  Bible Code 3   -  Bible Code 4   Bible Code Analysis pages  These Bible Codes and Analysis were done by Tom Gaston and Chris Van Houten   THE BIBLE CODE PREDICTS THAT YELLOWSTONE WILL BLOW MARCH 31 OR APRIL 1, 2004   [Editors note:  There were multiple quakes this week ]                           April 2004 Yellowstone Seismicity Summary       During April 2004, 508 earthquakes were located in the Yellowstone region.  The largest shock to occur during this period was a magnitude 2.7 earthquake  on April 17 at 1:22 AM MST, located about 8.8 miles northwest of Madison  Junction, Wyoming.       A notable swarm of small earthquakes occurred April 12-23. These were  located on the northwest side of Yellowstone National Park and northwest  of the Yellowstone caldera. The events were generally small and none were  reported felt. The swarm included 465 earthquakes. Magnitudes ranged from  -1.2 to 2.7, with 8 events greater than 2.0 magnitude. .

See   http://www.seis.utah.edu/recenteqs/Maps/111-45.html                           4-14-01 - I had this dream at exactly 2:00 a.m.                  DREAM - I was with a woman and her small children, her extended family       and a bunch of other people in hilly county.  Off to the northwest from       where we stood was a mountain or extremely high hill. It seemed to be several       miles away. It was a lovely summer day, the sun was shining, and people were       strolling around enjoying the weather. The mountain didn't have any snow       on top, so it had to have been high summer.                 All of a sudden, a spout of hot water came up out of the side of the mountain,       similar to Old Faithful. But it shot up so high and so far that it sprayed       hot water all the way over to where we were, several miles away.                  We were all rather shocked, and started to talk about it. And while we       discussed this event, it happened again, only stronger this time, only it       didn't stop, the water started spraying higher and higher and all of a sudden,       the whole mountain let loose, water, steam, smoke, dirt, rocks, (like mount       St. Helen's) except it just kept getting bigger and bigger. We knew that       what went up had to come down, and there didn't seem to be any place to       hide.                  It seemed stupid to run into a wooden building, but that's all I could       think of. We ran down a winding path to a wooden building like a garage,       between some fruit trees or whatever those trees were. The grandfather was       carrying one of the little kids, the woman carried one of the toddlers, and       a couple other kids around age 5 or 6 ran alongside. I hurried them along       the path, which was actually more or less back towards the mountain that       was exploding. Somehow, miraculously, the path we took was still dry, and       we ran fast enough that we made it into the garage before the deluge of hot       water, dust, ash, and rocks came back down.                   I doubt that the other people made it out alive, because there was no       where else to run. The whole mountain had disintegrated in explosion after       explosion.                 NOTE: I hope I never see a disaster like that again. It was horrendous.        (The clock now says 2:22)                  MORE: I went to lay down to meditate on 'when' this was going to occur.       Instead, I saw a white radio. On the front of the radio where the station       would be listed, it said, ""Microfront', and underneath that it said, ""Volcanic       Center"" and then the word 'underground' came to me.                                From: MCYoung/Tx,                  Subject: Another Yellowstone Dream/Vision                  Friday October 10,2003 4:44am(cdt)                 I was in a very large underground military or research facility though       not sure where. It was a huge open room with several hundred people working       or standing in small groups discussing what appeared to be computer print-outs       and maps.                 I saw rows of computers with men and women sitting in front of them. I       saw seismic drums along one wall(about 100 of them)all in a row. Next to       each of these were metal bins of some sort and they were catching computer       print-outs from these drums?                  Have never seen metal bins like these next to seismic drums. Several people       were retrieving the print-outs from the bins and then didcussing them.                 The most prominent feature in this open area was a huge screen upon one       wall displaying a map of the US, Canada, and Mexico.                 All the states were outlined and labled, including Canada and Mexico.       There was a large Red circle(shaded in)covering Yellowstone Park and some       of its surrounding areas.                 Beyond this there was a very large irregular area of the US and Canada       and a tiny part of Mexico shaded in Orange. All of WA, OR, ID, MT, WY, CO,       NM, ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, MN, WI, IA, MO, IL, LA, AR were covered in Orange.                 Northern California, most of NV, UT and, TX were also shaded in Orange.       The areas of Canada which border on the US were also shaded Orange with the       largest area being to the north and east of MN. Southwestern BC and Vancouver       Island were shaded in Orange and a small area of Mexico just below NM and       the Big Bend of TX.                 There were shaded areas extending over the Pacific from the Queen Charlotte       Islands down to San Francisco. Only the the norteastern part of AZ was shaded.       The western areas of IN, TN, and MS were also shaded in Orange.                 There were other smaller screens on each side of the huge one. These screens       showed the same map of US, Canada, Mexico but appeared to be some kind of       weather tracking maps. They showed weather radar, wind directions, the jet       streams,satellite images, aviation info and the like.                 Now I have no clue what exactly was occurring but there was clearly a       situation and the people in the room were looking very intense, worried and       they were all very busy, not one slacker in the room.                 From the looks of it, Yellowstone seemed to be at the center of all this       activity as it was circled in bright Red on the huge map. I do not know what       the Orange shading was about.                 This is all I recall. I was awakened by a loud electronic sound in my       ear and I sat up looked at my clock which read 4:44am(again!).                 I've been reading my journals and believe this is added information related       to yesterday morning's dream which I posted below, and also the dream of       October 3rd which I also posted.                 I wasn't able to get back yesterday due to the weather so will catch up       as much as possible now before the next round of storms rolls in.                 Something's happening and it's not making the news??? Appears that way       to me.                 peace                 mc                   FROM:        http://www.syzygyjob.net/dreams/messages/23742.shtml                          March 21, 2004       Hello Dee,                                         I found your great dreams website a few days ago while researching  visions & prophetic dreams.  I first became clairaudient  in 1992 and have experienced visions and prophetic dreams since that time.   My oldest child is an intuitive tarot reader. My second child can  see &  read auras. My third child appears to be gifted  with precognition, & my youngest child has begun experiencing prophetic  dreams and visions during the past few months.                                       After reading about the Yellowstone volcano, I thought it important  to email you, and share a couple of clairaudient messages  I had received...one from 2 years ago, and one just last week.  Also,  I wanted to share a prophetic dream my youngest child shared with me on March  17, 2004.  About 2 years ago, while casually surfing on the internet,  I received the following clairaudient message: ""The sleeping giant  is starting to wake up.""  Naturally, I immediately tried to research  what ""the sleeping giant"" was.  I concluded it had to be a volcano,  but I had no idea which one.  I finally wound up emailing a  volcanologist to ask which volcano was known as the ""sleeping giant.""   He couldn't help me as he said all dormant volcanoes were considered to be  sleeping.  I was stumped. I tried to research the ""sleeping giant"" some  more but couldn't find anything, and I eventually gave up.....until  I read about what is happening at Yellowstone.                                        Last week I received a message to purchase 24 candles. It didn't make  sense to me. I thought maybe it was tied to ""the 3 days of darkness."" Then  I dismissed that idea, because I figured 24 candles wouldn't be enough for  a 72-hour period.  Then I did some more reading, & learned  that the candles needed for the 3 day period are supposed to be blessed and  made of beeswax.  Then I did some reading on beeswax candles, because  I couldn't really understand the need for beeswax.  What I learned was  that beeswax apparently burns cleaner & lasts longer because of  it's purity.  I also learned  that one 8""  beeswax taper  typically lasts about 3 hours. That means one could expect to use 8  candles in a 24 hour period....or 24 candles in a 72-hour period...3 days.                                       Since my child first began receiving prophetic dreams and visions a few  months ago, one of the difficulties being encountered is that there are never  any dates or times being given for any of the events he has seen.  I  suggested that perhaps it would be a good idea to ask to be shown a clock  or calendar when the dream begins to perhaps pinpoint their occurrence.   In the dream, he looks out the window and it's a beautiful sunny day.   All of the snow is gone, and this strikes him as  being odd,  since it's supposed to still be winter outside.  He decides to  go look at the calendar hanging on the kitchen wall. He sees the  calendar has changed. Instead of it being March...the month is July,  but there is no year. In the bottom right corner are 2 months, one is July  (which he thinks is odd since it is already on the month of July) and the  other month is August. Another strange thing he observes is that although  we have currently a 'Scottie dog"" calendar, there is no Scottie dog  for the month of July....just a scene with a lake.  Dates are highlighted  in blue circles on the calendar for the month of July:  the dates are;  July 3rd, July 14th, and July 24th.  However, there are no dates  highlighted for  the month of August.                                         In view of what is currently happening at Yellowstone, I felt  perhaps the messages I had received, along with his prophetic dream  might be of some significance.  If I should receive any additional messages,  I would be happy to pass them on. Everything I have related about my  son's dream is exactly as he told me.                                         If you  should wish to share this on your website, you have my  permission.                                         Love &  Light                                         Lazarus                                                                    January 10, 2004 emergency posting (note the government pages were       taken down shortly after I captured this information) ... this morning 90       miles from anchorage Alaska a 7.1 earth quake registered and there has been       an unusual silence in the news media ... as it confirms my ongoing contention       that many of these quakes are due to solar flaring as was the case with the       Alaska quake ... however the pressing issue remains with the Yellowstone       volcano situation which is in a geological cycle to erupt again ... scroll       down to listen to my January 8, 2004 radio show archive for details ... i       have also noticed what appears to be continual influx of comets from the       south with the SOHO data being altered or outright deleted almost daily now       ... jim mccanney                  C/2001 Q4       (NEAT)         is ~ 14.5 mg  very slowly brightening,       but it may be a bright comet by 2004.

Last year, typical for the era when such measurements have been made, there were about 2,300 earthquakes in the park.      RUSSIAN QUAKES RELIEVE STRESSES AT YELLOWSTONE   JAPANESE QUAKES RELIEVE STRESSES AT YELLOWSTONE       10-6-03 - Yellowstone ground was 200 degrees     9-17-03 - People who have been at Yellowstone are saying that more and more areas are being  roped off, but the media isn't reporting this news.  The ground is getting hotter and hotter.      9-12-03 -  WHAT'S NEW?  USGS SAYS 'NOTHING'!!!    YEAH RIGHT!!!!       9-10-03 -   3.3     http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/states/wyoming/last_event.html     9-7-03 - Numerous micro-quakes occurring      After a 4.4 quake on 8-21-03, 9 aftershocks have occurred along with a resonance in the rock,  which can cause softening of the rock. If a fissure occurs in the rock, everyone within 600 miles  should be prepared for the sudden blast. There may be no precursor quakes prior to a blast at  Yellowstone Supervolcano.  If it blows, there will be no life within 600 miles except those people  who have prepared a place underneath the  ground.  Even airplanes within the area could be  blown out of the sky according to  Larry Park , an earthquake researcher who was interviewed  on the  coasttocoastam.com  George Noory show on 8-25-03. If the Supervolcano blows, it will  cause an immediate nuclear winter of dirt and ash in the air over the entire world for 2 years.  He also stated that there will be no crops grown in the midwest U.S. for that same period of time.     Larry Parks warns that people within that 600 miles should make preparations to survive the possible blast.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    There is a bulge over 100 feet high in the bottom of Yellowstone Lake.  The area under the northern end of the lake near  Mary Bay say that the bulge could have been formed by carbon dioxide or steam. The water in the lake which normally  gets no warmer than 66 degrees has now reached 85 degrees.  The bulge, which is about 2,100 feet long, has been   formed only within the last few years.  ""We're thinking this structure could be a precursor to a hydrothermal explosive  event, but we don't think this is a volcano,"" Lisa Morgan, geologist from USGS said.  A Mary Bay explosion  would likely cause a large crater, 1- foot waves, and a release or rocks and poisonous gas.  Mary Bay itself  is the world's largest hydrothermal explosion crater.  The USGS team hopes to prepare a damage assessment this fall.

Lava then began oozing from the cracks to fill the still smoking caldera.     Yellowstone has gone off roughly once every 600,000 years. Its last eruption was 640,000 years ago.    The next explosion is already overdue.     Typically, supervolcanoes are not mountains but depressions, huge collapsed craters called calderas, which are hard to detect.      The Yellowstone caldera is 70 kilometres long and 30 km wide.   Eight km beneath the Earth's surface lies a huge magma chamber, containing vast amounts of molten rock.      As pressure rises in the chamber, the surface is also rising and there is a measurable increase in heat.   But vulcanologists do not know when Yellowstone will blow.      A natural history of global disasters, portrays a possible Yellowstone explosion in 2074,   says there have been two such events every 100,000 years for the last two million years.      The areas where supervolcanoes are most likely to be found, he says, are subduction zones,   where the Earth's plates are dipping below one another.   The Pacific Rim and southeast Asia are especially vulnerable.      But there is a caldera in the Phlegraean Fields near Naples in southern Italy. Dr Ted Nield, of the Geological Society of London,   told BBC News Online: ""It could do the same as Yellowstone, though on a smaller scale"".

During that eruption, ground-hugging flows of hot       volcanic ash, pumice, and gases swept across an area of more than 3,000 square       miles. When these enormous pyroclastic flows finally stopped, they solidified       to form a layer of rock called the Lava Creek Tuff. Its volume was about       240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers), enough material to cover Wyoming       with a layer 13 feet thick or the entire conterminous United States with       a layer 5 inches thick. The Lava Creek Tuff has been exposed by erosion at       Tuff Cliff, a popular Yellowstone attraction along the lower Gibbon River.                  The eruption also shot a column of volcanic ash and gases high into Earth's       stratosphere. This volcanic cloud circled the globe many times and affected       Earth's climate by reducing the intensity of solar radiation reaching the       lower atmosphere and surface. Fine volcanic ash that fell downwind from the       eruption site blanketed much of North America. This ash layer is still preserved       in deposits as far away as Iowa, where it is a few inches thick, and the       Gulf of Mexico, where it is recognizable in drill cores from the sea floor.                  Lava flows have since buried and obscured most of the caldera, but the       underlying processes responsible for Yellowstone's    tremendous volcanic eruptions       are still at work. Eventually, another ""bead"" may be added to Yellowstone's       300-mile-long string of calderas, with global consequences that are beyond       human experience and impossible to anticipate fully.

The closure is clearly marked and covers most of the western portion of the       Back Basin trail starting at the Norris Museum. The foot trail itself is       at boiling temperatures and the potential for a steam explosion is considered       to be very high. While predictions can be made for volcanic explosions, steam       explosions cannot be predicted. Steamboat and Echinus Geysers and all of       Porcelain Basin remain open to the public         In July, 2003, Yellowstone Park rangers closed the entire Norris       Geyser Basin because of deformation of the land and excessive high ground temperatures. There is an area that is 28 miles long by 7       miles wide that has bulged upward over five inches since 1996, and this year the ground temperature on that bulge has reached over       200 degrees (measured one inch below ground level).         There was no choice but to close off the entire area. Everything in       this area is dying: The trees, flowers, grass and shrubs. A dead zone is developing and spreading outward. The animals are literally       migrating out of the park.         Then during the last part of July one of the Park geologists       discovered a huge bulge at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. The bulge has already risen over 100 feet from the bottom of the lake and the water       temperature at the surface of the bulge has reached 88 degrees and is still rising.         Keep in mind that Yellowstone Lake is a high mountain lake with very       cold water temperatures. The Lake is now closed to the public. It is filled with dead fish floating everywhere. The same is true of the       Yellowstone river and most of the other streams in the Park. Dead and dying fish are filling the water everywhere.         Many of the picnic areas in the Park have been closed and people       visiting the Park usually stay but a few hours before leaving since the stench of sulfur is so strong they literally can't stand the smell.         The irony of all this is the silence by the news media and our       government. Very little information is available from Yellowstone personnel or publications. What mainstream newsstories do appear       underscore the likelihood of a massive volcanic eruption. Though geologists publicly admit Yellowstone is “overdue,” they have       been quoted as stating another massive magma release may not occur for 100,000 or 2 million years. Others close to the story       are convinced that a massive eruption is imminent. A source that has demonstrated first-hand knowledge of the park's history and       recent geothermal events stated the following: “The American people are not being told that the explosion of this 'super volcano' could       happen at any moment. When Yellowstone does blow, some geologists predict that every living thing within six hundred miles is       likely to die. The movement of magma has been detected just three-tenths of a mile below the bulging surface of the ground in       Yellowstone raising concerns that this super volcano may erupt soon.”         ~~~~~~~~                 After 8 years, Yellowstone geyser erupts         Staff and agencies        15 June, 2006         Wed Jun 14, 9:12 AM ET         YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. - A large geyser that hadn‘t       erupted since 1998 surprised two hikers near the edge of Norris Geyser       Basin with a roar and burst of steam.         The geyser erupted at full bore around 5 p.m. Saturday, sending a       plume of steam about 100 feet high.         Watry, who works for the Yellowstone Association, said they were       shocked at the show that unfolded about a quarter-mile away.         The eruption coincided with other unusual activity at Norris over       the weekend, including the eruption of other sporadic geysers and changes       in surface water. Henry Heasler, Yellowstone‘s lead geologist, said       Norris appeared to be undergoing a ""thermal disturbance"" — an       infrequent and often sudden shift in activity.         Such disturbances result from subsurface activity that brings water       closer to the surface.         Among other changes, the usually quiet Vixen geyser has been       erupting, Pearl geyser‘s water has changed from clear to opalescent, and       water elsewhere in the basin has turned murky.         Scott Bryan, author of ""The Geysers of Yellowstone,"" said       Ledge was active in the early 1970s until a thermal disturbance in 1974.       After that, eruptions were less frequent until 1979, when it quieted down       completely.                 2006 The Associated Press.

Due to a misread map label, in 1904 the feature was inadvertently       given its current name. It was observed to erupt to heights of over 60 feet from 1993 to 1996. It became almost dormant in 1997 and has remained very       quiet ever since. Blue Geyser's last observed eruption was in February of       1997.                                     LEDGE GEYSER                   Ledge is the second largest       geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin, capable of shooting water 125 feet into       the air. Because it erupts at an angle, however, the water will sometimes       reach the ground 220 feet away. It has at times in the past erupted at regular       intervals of 14 hours. The geyser became inactive between 1979 and late 1993.       It erupted on a fairly regular cycle of every four to six days in 1994 and       1995.                                     WHIRLIGIG GEYSER                   Little Whirligig got its       name because of its close proximity to Whirligig Geyser. Whirligig was so named because while erupting its water swirls in its crater. The orange-yellow       iron oxide deposits around Little Whirligig make it one of the most colorful       features in Porcelain Basin. It has been dormant for several years.                                     BLACK GROWLER STEAM VENT                   The hottest of Yellowstone's       geothermal features are steam vents (fumaroles). Black Growler Steam Vent,       on the hillside in front of you, has measured 199 to 280 degrees F (93 to       138 degrees C). A plentiful water supply would help cool these features;       however, steam vents are usually found on hillsides or higher ground, above       the basin's water supply. They rapidly boil away what little water they contain,       releasing steam and other gases forcefully from    underground.

(Kyle Wagner | The Denver Post) At 11:32 this morning, a 3.5 magnitude earthquake was reported 38 miles east southeast of West Yellowstone, Mont., in Yellowstone National Park — the latest in a swarm of earthquakes that has hit the area in the past week.   The 3.5 tremor was followed this afternoon by a 3.2 magnitude quake at 12:40 p.m. and a 3.0 temblor at 1:15 p.m.   The swarm of tremors is the largest series of back-to-back quakes to hit the area in years, according to scientists.   Today's quakes came on the heels of a series of tremors on New Year's Day, including a 3.0 at 6:30 p.m. and a 3.1 at 6:21 p.m.   ""The December 2008 earthquake sequence is the most intense in this area for some years,"" said the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. ""No damage has     Yellowstone Quakes          Visit  a website that tracks seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park .             been reported within Yellowstone National Park, nor would any be expected from earthquakes of this size.""   According to the observatory, Yellowstone seismicity increased significantly in December because of what it described as an ""energetic earthquake swarm"" that began Dec. 26.   The swarm is occurring beneath the northern part of Yellowstone Lake in the park.   The largest of the quakes, according to the observatory, was a magnitude 3.9 at 10:15 p.m. on Dec. 27.   Some of the larger earthquakes have been felt by park employees and guests, according to the observatory.   The observatory was created as a partnership of the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park and the University of Utah. It monitors long-term volcanic and earthquake activity in the Yellowstone National Park region.   Professor Robert B. Smith, a geophysicist at the University of Utah and one of the leading experts on earthquake and volcanic activity at Yellowstone, said that the swarm is of keen interest to scientists.   ""It's not business as usual,"" said Smith. ""This is a large earthquake swarm, and we've recorded several hundred. We are paying careful attention. This is an important sequence.""   Smith noted that beginning in 2004, there was ""accelerated uplift of the Yellowstone Caldera"" that covered the entire caldera.   In 2007, Smith and his University of Utah colleagues said the current rise in the caldera was ""unprecedented"" but concluded that because there were no major earthquakes or ""earthquake swarms"" accompanying the uplift, they found ""little indication that the volcano is moving toward an eruption.""   The last major earthquake swarm was in 1985 and lasted three months, Smith told The Denver Post.   The Yellowstone Plateau, which comprises Yellowstone National Park, is one of the largest super-volcanoes in the world and has gone through three volcanic cycles spanning two million years that included some of the world's largest-known eruptions.   Through 5 p.m. Dec. 31, the swarm had included 12 events of magnitude 3.0 to 3.9 and approximately 20 of 2.5 to 2.9, with a total of 400 quakes large enough to be located.   The observatory said similar swarms have occurred in the past without triggering steam explosions or volcanic activity. However, the observatory said there is some potential for explosions and that earthquakes may continue and increase in intensity.   Joe Moore, director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, said his office is tracking the events at Yellowstone on a minute-by-minute basis.   ""It's being followed very closely,"" said Moore.   He said his office has evaluated the emergency plans — which includes evacuations — developed by Teton County, where Jackson Hole is located, and Park County, where Cody is located.   Should a destructive earthquake or volcanic explosion occur, he said his agency would assist those counties as well as communities in Fremont County, which includes the Wind River Indian Reservation.   He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Denver is closely monitoring the seismic activity in Yellowstone.   ""They are following it as much as we are,"" said Moore. ""There has been an outstanding exchange of information"" between local, state and federal agencies, he said.   Yellowstone is the site of the largest and most diverse collection of natural thermal features in the world.   The most devastating earthquake in recent history in the Yellowstone region occurred on Aug. 17, 1959, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit. It was centered near Hebgen Lake, Mont., killed 28 people and caused more than $11 million in damage. Geysers in Yellowstone National park changed eruption times, and new ones began to erupt. On June 30, 1975, a magnitude 6.4 tremor hit the park.

Historical poster of Yellowstone from 1938       Yellowstone National Park , established by the  U.S. Congress [ 3 ]  as a  national park  on March 1, 1872, is located primarily in the  U.S. state  of  Wyoming , though it also extends into  Montana  and  Idaho . The park was the first of its kind, and is known for its  wildlife  and  its many geothermal features , especially  Old Faithful Geyser , one of the most popular features in the park. [ 1 ]  It has many types of  ecosystems , but the  subalpine   forest  is dominant.   Aboriginal Americans  have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by  mountain men  during the early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The  U.S. Army  was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the  National Park Service , which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.   Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468 square miles (8,983 km), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and  mountain ranges . [ 1 ]   Yellowstone Lake  is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the  Yellowstone Caldera , the largest  supervolcano  on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. [ 4 ]   Lava  flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the largest remaining, nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. [ 5 ]   Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either  endangered  or  threatened . [ 1 ]  The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Grizzlies ,  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk  live in the park.  Forest fires  occur in the park each year; in the  large forest fires  of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including  hiking ,  camping ,  boating ,  fishing  and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either  snow coaches  or  snowmobile .

Near the end of the  18th century ,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the  1950s , an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the  Lewis and Clark Expedition , left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.     [ edit ]   Geography          Yellowstone Lake on an autumn morning              Map of Wyoming showing the Yellowstone National Park       Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]           Madison River .       The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Note the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology   Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano          Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology   Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem           Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Fauna   Main articles:  Animals of Yellowstone  and  Wolf reintroduction           Bison  graze near a hot spring       Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest  megafauna  wildlife habitat in the  lower 48 states . There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]  After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires   See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988           Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5 C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation   Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park   Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park          Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.

Historical poster of Yellowstone from 1938       Yellowstone National Park , established by the  U.S. Congress [ 3 ]  as a  national park  on March 1, 1872, is located primarily in the  U.S. state  of  Wyoming , though it also extends into  Montana  and  Idaho . The park was the first of its kind, and is known for its  wildlife  and  its many geothermal features , especially  Old Faithful Geyser , one of the most popular features in the park. [ 1 ]  It has many types of  ecosystems , but the  subalpine   forest  is dominant.   Aboriginal Americans  have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by  mountain men  during the early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The  U.S. Army  was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the  National Park Service , which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.   Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468 square miles (8,983 km), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and  mountain ranges . [ 1 ]   Yellowstone Lake  is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the  Yellowstone Caldera , the largest  supervolcano  on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. [ 4 ]   Lava  flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the largest remaining, nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. [ 5 ]   Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either  endangered  or  threatened . [ 1 ]  The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Grizzlies ,  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk  live in the park.  Forest fires  occur in the park each year; in the  large forest fires  of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including  hiking ,  camping ,  boating ,  fishing  and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either  snow coaches  or  snowmobile .

Near the end of the eighteenth century,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the 1950s, an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.     [ edit ]   Geography          Yellowstone Lake on an autumn morning              Map of Wyoming showing the Yellowstone National park       Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]    The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstonenote the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology       Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano              Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology       Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem               Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Fauna       Main articles:  Animals of Yellowstone  and  Wolf reintroduction               Bison  graze near a hot spring       Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest  megafauna  wildlife habitat in the  lower 48 states . There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. After a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna. Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires     See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988             Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5C C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation       Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park       Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park              Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.

Location : Northwest Wyoming, stretching into Montana on the north and Idaho on the west.     Airports :  Yellowstone Regional Airport  (COD) is located in Cody, WY — minutes away from Yellowstone's east gate.  There are daily flights to the airport through  Delta Air Lines  and  United Express .  Cars can be rented at the airport, from  Hertz ,  Thrifty  or  Budget .   Yellowstone National Park is the United States' — and the world's — first national park, established by the US Congress on March 1, 1872.  Covering over 2.2 million acres/899,000 hectares, the park is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined.  The park's highest point is on Eagle Peak (11,358 ft/3,462 m); its lowest point is at Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m).  It boasts one of the world's largest petrified forests, the tallest waterfall (Lower Falls of the  Yellowstone River , 308 ft/94 m), some 290 waterfalls that flow year-round, more than 300  geysers , one of the world's largest  calderas  and an active volcano,  Old Faithful , which erupts almost every hour.  The park experiences some 2,000 earthquakes each year.   Over two million nature lovers visit the site yearly, hiking from its 97  trailheads  along the 950 mi/1,529 km of backcountry trails and driving the 466 mi/750 km of roads (310 mi/499 km paved miles).  There are nine visitors centers and museums, nine lodging facilities hosting a total of more than 2,000 rooms, more than 2,000 camping sites, about 50 picnic areas and a marina.  There are also more than 1,100 historic structures, including six  National Historic Landmarks .  Twenty-one affiliated  American Indian  tribes are associated with the park.   A little historical background:   According to the website   Yellowstone Net , the term ""yellow stone"" was coined by Canadian explorer  David Thompson  in the late 1700s; he noted that the canyon walls, which tower over the river near the  Mandan  villages that he visited on the upper  Missouri , look like yellow stone.  By 1830, some reports had begun to filter out about the area and its unique thermal activity, geysers, and the sounds of booming and thunder from the volcano, but most did not believe the stories, thinking they were too farfetched.   There were a number of visits to the region in the early- and mid-nineteenth century, but the descriptions were considered outlandish and unreliable.  Finally, in the 1870s, several groups entered the region, including a group of gold prospectors and another party led by  Henry D. Washburn , surveyor-general of the  Montana  territory, and the one who gave Old Faithful its name. This group's exploration became known as the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition .  Nathaniel P. Langford  was the group's scribe and was later selected as the first Park Superintendent; First Lieutenant Gustavus Doane was the military escort who accompanied the group and made an official report of the journey to the US government; Cornelius Hedges and Walter Trumbull were journalists who helped spread the word about the wonders of Yellowstone following the expedition. Truman C. Everts was the oldest member of the party.  He became separated from the rest and was lost in the Yellowstone wilderness for thirty-seven days as winter approached.  When he survived the ordeal, his incredible story helped to increase the nation's interest in Yellowstone.  During the expedition, Washburn named ""Old Faithful.""   The following year another group was sent by Congress to make an official survey of the area.  Their report led to the establishment of Yellowstone National Park on March 1, 1872, signed by President Ullyses S. Grant.  Twenty years later the Lacey Act was signed, giving full protection to most of the park's wildlife. The first year that an official count was taken of visitors to the park was in 1895, when 5,438 people came to tour Yellowstone. In 1976, Yellowstone National Park was designated a  biosphere reserve  and in 1978, it was recognized as a  World Heritage Site .    It is illegal to feed the wildlife at Yellowstone National Park!   A Quick Look There are five entrances to the park.  It's recommended that you enter and exit by different routes, in order to cover as much of the park and its beauty as possible.  The speed limit in the park is 45 mph/72 km/h.    East Entrance:  Located 56 miles west of Cody, WY, off Highway 14, 16, or 20.   South Entrance: Located in Wyoming, accessed via Highways 191, 89 or 287 North. (Grand Teton National Park, a 26-mile-long national park, is situated just two miles south of Yellowstone Park; entrance fees to Grand Teton are effective for entry into Yellowstone as well.)   West Entrance:  Located one half mile east of  West Yellowstone, MT , and accessed by Highways 287, 87 or 20.   North Entrance:  Located in the town of Gardiner, MT, and accessed by Highway 89.   Northeast Entrance:  Located about 2 miles from Cooke City, MT, and accessed by Highways 212 or 291.   Don't Miss It is suggested that visitors allow three days to a week for a proper experience in Yellowstone National Park.  There are hundreds of sites, kinds of flora and animals to see, but the ten spots in the park that you should not miss are:     Old Faithful / Upper Geyser Basin  — Yellowstone is renowned for its hundreds of active geysers, the largest of which is Old Faithful, named for its predictability:  it erupts for about four minutes every 60-90 minutes.  The Upper Geyser Basin where Old Faithful is located has numerous geothermal features, including  hot springs ,  mudholes  and  fumaroles .   Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  — Not to be confused with the  Grand Canyon , this is a canyon of the Yellowstone River that descends to a depth of 900 ft/275 m and is a half mile/0.8 km wide.   Hayden Valley  — Centrally located in Yellowstone, this is home to a large concentration of wildlife and fowl. Here you can see bison, elk, the occasional grizzly bear, ducks, geese, pelicans and spectacular views of the valley floor.   Mammoth Hot Springs  — a complex of hot springs, located in the park's northwest corner, in the Mammoth District.  Accessible year-round, with comparatively mild winters, it's the site of the park's main headquarters,  Fort Yellowstone .    Yellowstone Lake  — the largest high-altitude lake in the mainland 48 states; one can see ocean-like waves breaking against the shore on windy days.   Norris Geyser Basin  —  Echinus  and  Steamboat  (the world's tallest geyser) are both located here.  There are several miles of boardwalks from which you can see magnificent thermal features, elk and bison.   Lamar Valley  — Located in the northeast section of the park, this is where the highest concentration of grizzlies can be found in the park.  It's also home to elk, bison, osprey, bald eagles, antelope, moose and black bears.   Tower Fall  — Located behind the General Store, this is one of Yellowstone's most popular waterfalls.  It's recommended to take the short but steep hike down to the base of the waterfall.  In the winter, it is accessible by following Roosevelt Junction to Tower Fall Road.  Wear snowshoes or cross-country skis.    Fountain Paint Pots / Lower Geyser Basin  — The multi-colored  mud pots  are located between the Lower and Midway Geyser Basins.   West Thumb Geyser Basin  — This  caldera  within a caldera is the largest geyser basin on the shores of Yellowstone Lake.     Getting Around The best way to get around Yellowstone National Park is by car.  The entrance fee for a private vehicle is $20, good for seven days. An annual pass for a private vehicle costs $50.  An individual can enter on foot or bicycle for $10, good for seven days, or $40 for an annual pass.  Entrance for a motorcycle costs $25, good for seven days, or $40 for an annual pass.  Entrance fees do not include camping fees.

The Gallatin,  Absaroka , and  Teton  mountain ranges extend into it. Yellowstone has unusual geologic features, including fossil forests and eroded basaltic lava flows. It also has 10,000 hot springs, which erupt as steam vents, fumaroles, and geysers. Old Faithful, the park's most famous geyser, erupts every 33 to 120 minutes. There are many lakes and rivers, including  Yellowstone Lake , Shoshone Lake, the  Snake River , and the  Yellowstone River . In 1988 an extensive series of forest fires temporarily laid waste to large areas of the park.

Its enabling act, signed 1 March 1872 by President Ulysses S. Grant, withdrew lands from the public domain for use as a ""public park or pleasuring ground"" for the ""preservation, from injury or  spoliation , of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders&and their  retention  in their natural condition."" The Yellowstone National Park Act established a significant  conservationist  precedent, leading to the formation of more than twelve hundred parks and preserves in more than one hundred countries. The national park idea represents one of the major, original contributions of the United States to world thought. Native Americans utilized Yellowstone for hunting and fishing hundreds of years before whites frequented the region. In 1807 the trapper John Colter became the first Euro-American to visit Yellowstone. Information regarding Yellowstone's natural features remained  scarce  until the late 1860s, when several exploring parties surveyed the area. Cornelius Hedges, a Massachusetts-born Montana judge and member of the Washburn-Langford-Doane expedition in 1870, has often been credited with proposing Yellowstone as a national park, although historians have since questioned the validity of his claim. The Yellowstone National Park Act was drawn up by William H. Clagett, a Montana territorial delegate in Congress; Nathaniel Langford, territorial revenue collector and later first park superintendent; and Ferdinand V. Hayden, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey, whose 1871 expedition showered Congress with illustrations and photographs of Yellowstone's fantastical landscape. Yellowstone was under military  stewardship  from 1886 until 1918, when the newly created National Park Service (1916) took responsibility for its operation. California lawyer Horace M. Albright became Yellowstone's first civilian superintendent. Yellowstone remains the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Its three thousand hot springs and two hundred geysers, including Old Faithful, signify the world's largest concentration of  geothermal  features.  Yellowstone Lake  represents the largest high-mountain lake in North America, covering 137 square miles at an elevation of 7,730 feet. There the  Yellowstone River  starts its 671-mile journey to the Missouri River, bequeathing the park its famous 1,200-foot deep Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River and its Upper Falls and Lower Falls; the latter, almost twice as high as Niagara Falls, drops 308 feet. The park supports an array of wildlife, including grizzly and black bears, elk,  bighorn  sheep, moose, antelope, coyotes and more than two hundred varieties of bird. Yellowstone's protected wildlands provide vital habitat for threatened species, notably the once endangered trumpeter swan and the country's only continuously wild  herd  of  bison . Shifting biological theories, increased visitation, and external threats present decisive challenges for Yellow-stone's managers. In the summer of 1988, 45 percent of the park was razed by fire, fueling criticism of official natural regulation policy. Affected areas have since recovered. In January 1995, following two decades of  protracted  debate and  capacious  biological studies, federal agencies reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone under the terms of the Endangered Species Act (1973). Wolves had been absent from the park since the 1920s, when they were eradicated as part of an official campaign to remove  predatory  animals. Yellowstone National Park, which observed its 125th anniversary in 1997, attracts more than 3 million visitors a year. Bibliography Bartlett, Richard A.  Yellowstone: A Wilderness Besieged.

It lies mainly on a broad plateau in the Rocky Mts., on the Continental Divide, c.8,000 ft (2,440 m) above sea level, surrounded by mountains from 10,000 to 14,000 ft (3,0484,267 m) high. The area, a huge craterlike volcanic basin (caldera), is a geological hot spot and the site of several massive eruptions, the most recent occurring some 600,000 years ago. The plateau is mostly formed from once-molten lava. Volcanic activity is evidenced by nearly 10,000 hot springs, 200 geysers, and many vents and mud pots. The more prominent geysers are unequaled in size, power, and variety. Old Faithful, the best known although not the largest, erupts every 40 to 70 min and shoots c.11,000 gal (41,640 liters) of water some 150 ft (46 m) high. Mammoth Hot Springs, a series of five terraces with reflecting pools, continues to grow as residue from the mineral-rich water is deposited. The park also has petrified forests, lava formations, and the black glass Obsidian Cliff. Eagle Peak, 11,370 ft (3,466 m), is the highest point. Yellowstone Lake, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and waterfalls are notable features on the Yellowstone River, which crosses the park. The park has a wide variety of flowers and other plant life. Bears, mountain sheep, elk, bison, moose, many smaller animals, and more than 200 kinds of birds inhabit Yellowstone, which is one of the world's largest wildlife sanctuaries. Fires in 1988 burned about 36% of the park, but animal and plant life rebounded quickly, as the nutrient influx in the ash nourished the soil. See also  National Parks and Monuments , table.

Near the end of the  18th century ,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the  1950s , an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the  Lewis and Clark Expedition , left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.     [ edit ]   Geography          Yellowstone Lake on an autumn morning              Map of Wyoming showing the Yellowstone National Park       Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]           Madison River .       The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Note the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology   Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano          Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology   Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem           Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Fauna   Main articles:  Animals of Yellowstone  and  Wolf reintroduction           Bison  graze near a hot spring       Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest  megafauna  wildlife habitat in the  lower 48 states . There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]  After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires   See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988           Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5 C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation   Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park   Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park          Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.

In this chapter we begin by describing the geologic history of                  the California Coast Ranges, including how they were deformed                  and uplifted to their present location. We then discuss the origins                  of the sediments found at Quail Ridge and the derivation of local                  soils.                  Geologic History                 Plate Convergence and Subduction                 The geologic history of northern California begins with the series                  of plate convergence and subduction events that added the state                  to the western edge of North America. The formation and movement                  of the earth’s lithospheric plates begins at mid-ocean spreading                  centers, where hot rock rises from the Earth’s interior                  and partially melts to form new oceanic lithosphere (oceanic crust                  and upper mantle). As the molten rock crystallizes at these spreading                  centers, it forms a vertically ordered series of rocks that include                  peridotite at the base, followed by gabbro, diabase, and at the                  top, basalt flows that erupt on the seafloor. When exposed on                  land, this series is collectively known as an ophiolite. As this                  new lithosphere forms, older lithosphere migrates away from the                  spreading centers, subsides, and becomes buried under marine sediments.                  This movement inevitably leads to the convergence of separate                  lithospheric plates. Subduction is the disappearance of one plate                  beneath another during convergence; the relatively cold subducted                  (down-going) plate becomes heated as it sinks into the hot mantle,                  and partially melts to form magma sources for chains of volcanoes,                  such as the Andes or the Cascades. Magma that comes to rest in                  the crust beneath the volcanoes cools and crystallizes slowly                  to form granitic rocks, thus building up the continental crust.                 A continent-building plate convergence occurred in the late Jurassic,                  Cretaceous, and Tertiary periods (about 140 to 5 million years                  ago), when the oceanic Kula and Farallon Plates, coming from the                  west, were subducted beneath the North American continental margin                  ( see below ). This process was instrumental                  in creating the rocks of both the Coast Ranges and the Sierra                  Nevada. As first the Kula and later the Farallon plate descended                  beneath the North American continent, hot fluids derived from                  the descending plate caused melting in the mantle below the overriding                  continental plate. This produced a chain of volcanoes on the continent                  that were very similar to the present-day Cascade volcanoes, where                  subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate (a remnant of the Farallon                  Plate) beneath North America is still occurring today. The molten                  rock remaining beneath the volcanoes cooled to become the Sierra                  Nevada Batholith, the black and white granitic rock that characterizes                  that range. Similar rocks are present, but less abundant, in the                  Klamath Mountains.                                   Subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath                  the North American continental margin, 140-100 million years ago.                                   Sediments derived from the ancient Sierra Nevada and Klamaths                  were transported by rivers to the ocean where they settled in                  the basin just beyond the edge of the continent. These sediments                  were buried and transformed into sedimentary rock that was later                  uplifted and exposed as the Great Valley Sequence (GVS) that forms                  much of California’s eastern (inner) Coast Range, including                  all of the Quail Ridge Reserve. The material of the subducted                  Farallon and Kula plates, mostly marine sediments, was scraped                  off against the edge of the continent to create a complex of diverse                  rocks known as the “Franciscan mélange”. The                  Franciscan mélange, or complex, makes up most of the western                  (outer) coast Range. Unlike the orderly strata of the Great Valley                  Sequence, the Franciscan complex became so badly deformed that                  it contains very complex structure and few fossils.                  The Coast Range Ophiolite lies between the rocks of the Great                  Valley Sequence and the Franciscan mélange, and represents                  the oceanic crust on which the Great Valley sediments were deposited.                  The Coast Range Ophiolite consists largely of serpentinite, partly                  serpentinized peridotite, gabbro, and basalt. It was later pushed                  to the surface in the folding and faulting that produced the present                  Coast Ranges.                  Transform Movement on the San Andreas Fault System                 The spreading center that created the Farallon Plate was part                  of the East Pacific Rise. As the Farallon Plate subducted beneath                  North America, the ridge (East Pacific Rise) approached and then                  collided with the subduction zone ( see below ),                  bringing the Pacific plate, west of the Farallon plate, into contact                  with the North American plate and changing the direction of motion                  along the edge of North America from convergent (between the North                  American and Farallon Plates) to transform (between the North                  American and Pacific Plates). The Farallon plate was divided into                  two plates, which became smaller and more widely separated with                  time, with the progressively longer San Andreas fault system in                  between. Two so-called triple junctions arose out of this process                  – the Mendocino triple junction to the northwest and the                  Rivera triple junction to the southeast. The Mendocino triple                  junction to the northwest is the meeting point of the Pacific,                  North American, and Juan de Fuca plates. North of the Mendocino                  triple junction, subduction continues, and as the Juan de Fuca                  plate disappears, the triple junction moves northwest along the                  continental margin like a closing zipper. As it does so, the direction                  of relative plate movement along the western edge of the continent                  has changed, with the Pacific plate moving northwest relative                  to the North American plate in transform or strike-slip movement.                  Thus the well-known San Andreas Fault system, along which the                  plates slide past each other, developed along the former convergent                  margin.                 At the latitude of Quail Ridge Reserve, this change from convergent                  to transform plate motion began about 5 million years ago. As                  the Pacific plate slides past the North American plate, localized                  centers of compression and extension develop at the jagged edges                  of former plate boundaries. Extensional centers, or pull-apart                  basins, became the elongated northwest-southeast valleys of the                  Coast Ranges, and in places these also became centers of volcanic                  activity. Compressional centers, characterized by reverse or thrust                  faulting and associated folding, are present along the Coast Ranges.                  Uplift of the Coast Ranges began about 2-3 million years ago,                  perhaps in response to a slight change in Pacific-North American                  relative motion, and it continues today. This uplift has brought                  the oceanic crustal rocks of the Coast Range Ophiolite to the                  surface.                                   Collision of the Eastern Pacific Rise and                  the subduction zone and formation of the Mendocino Triple Junction,                                    40 - 20 million years ago.                  Great Valley Sediments                 The stratigraphy of the Great Valley Sequence (GVS) sediments                  on Quail Ridge is largely obscured by vegetation, but visitors                  who approach the Ridge from the east have the opportunity to get                  a great view of them at the Monticello Dam overlook, as well as                  in the roadcuts from there to the Reserve. Sediments at the dam                  and in the Reserve, originally laid down horizontally, are nearly                  vertical. In the gap at Devil’s Gate where the dam was built,                  it is clear that some of the strata are more resistant to erosion                  than others – in general, the sandstones are more resistant                  than the finer grained silt and shale layers.                 These sediments were laid down over a period of 75 million years,                  from 140-65 million years ago. They are derived by erosion from                  the early Sierra Nevada and/or Klamath Mountains, which were up                  to 3000-4000 m high (for reference, the peak of Mt. Whitney is                  4417 m above sea level). The sediments appear to have been deposited                  off the edge of the continent in approximately 1000-2000 m of                  water. Pulses of sediment-rich slurries, referred to by geologists                  as turbidity flows, coursed off the continental shelf, apparently                  in response to some disturbance, possibly earthquakes, onto oceanic                  crust that became the Coast Range Ophiolite. Seismic data collected                  to guide the drilling of oil and gas exploration wells show that                  the GVS is currently 10,000-13,000 m thick beneath the western                  Sacramento Valley, but some of the original sedimentary deposits                  likely were not that thick. Folding and thrust faulting have resulted                  in stacking of the sediments upon themselves.                  Although the sediments of the Great Valley Sequence have been                  uplifted, faulted and folded, much can still be understood about                  their deposition. After the large turbidity flows, particles of                  different sizes settled at different rates. The sandstones in                  particular often show “graded bedding,” with coarser                  sand grains at the base and finer grains at the top. The finest                  particles, those that become shale, may have taken weeks or years                  to settle out after each large turbidity flow event. Between turbidity                  flow events, fine mud settled on the seafloor forming the thicker                  beds of shale. This pattern provides a means to interpret how                  the layers were deposited and which are the younger sediments,                  allowing one to infer how the strata were oriented when they were                  horizontal.                 The size-graded sand and shale deposits formed by the large,                  disturbance-related turbidity flows created deposits know as “turbidites”                  which make up the GVS. Many turbidites have casts of grooves,                  scour, or gouge marks on the bottom of sandstone beds that were                  made when the turbidity current flowed over the underlying mud.                  These markings sometimes show the direction that the turbidity                  currents moved when the deposits were formed. This allows us to                  determine that the dominant currents and the downslope direction                  when these rocks were deposited were generally from north to south.                                 The mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerates                  in these marine sediments range from 50 to 90 million years old                  at the eastern (younger) edge of the deposit, to about 140 million                  years old in the oldest strata represented at Quail Ridge. The                  zone of transition to Franciscan mélange and exposed Coast                  Range Ophiolite is only a few miles west of the Reserve, near                  Muscovite Corner.                  Thus, the geologic history of Quail Ridge is one of ancient deposition                  by turbidites (GVS) and subduction (mélange) followed by                  uplift and distortion as the Coast Range was formed. Most of the                  rocks and sediments at Quail Ridge are relatively low in the GVS                  stratigraphic sequence, and thus are relatively old. They consist                  primarily of fine-grained depositions (mudstones to shale), although                  in places conglomerates are present. The latter possibly originated                  from isolated submarine landslides or slurry flows (turbidity                  currents) of beach gravel off the coast of North America.

A:  There is no evidence that a catastrophic eruption at Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is imminent. Current geologic activity at Yellowstone has remained relatively constant since earth scientists first started monitoring some 30 years ago. Though another caldera-forming eruption is theoretically possible, it is very unlikely to occur in the next thousand or even 10,000 years. Scientists have also found no indication of an imminent smaller eruption of lava.     Q: How much advance notice would there be of an eruption?   A:  The science of forecasting a volcanic eruption has significantly advanced over the past 25 years. Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption. Scientists at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory* (YVO) closely monitor the Yellowstone region for such precursors. They expect that the buildup to larger eruptions would include intense precursory activity (far exceeding background levels) at multiple spots within the Yellowstone volcano. As at many caldera systems around the world, small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and gas releases at Yellowstone are commonplace events and do not reflect impending eruptions.   *The YVO is a collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey, the University of Utah, and YNP to monitor and study the Yellowstone Volcano. Congress has given the USGS the responsibility of volcano hazard assessment, and YNP assists the USGS in their volcano monitoring effort.       Q: In regard to volcanic activity, is it safe to visit Yellowstone?    A:  Yes. Scientists do not have any indication of an imminent eruption, or any eruption, at this time.     Q: What is park staff doing to monitor and assess the probability of an eruption?   A:  The YVO maintains an array of instruments that monitor activities at Yellowstone around the clock. In addition, YVO scientists collaborate with scientists from all over the world to study and assess the hazards of the Yellowstone volcano. To learn more about Yellowstone's volcanic past and to view current data about earthquakes, ground movement, and stream flow, visit the YVO website at  http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/ .     Q: When will the volcano erupt again? Will there be any warning? How much warning will there be?   A:  The science of forecasting a volcanic eruption has significantly advanced over the past 25 years. Most scientists think that the buildup preceding a catastrophic eruption would be detectable for weeks and perhaps months to years. Precursors to volcanic eruptions include strong earthquake swarms and rapid ground deformation and typically take place days to weeks before an actual eruption. Scientists at the YVO closely monitor the Yellowstone region for such precursors. They expect that the buildup to larger eruptions would include intense precursory activity (far exceeding background levels) at multiple spots within the Yellowstone volcano. As at many caldera systems around the world, small earthquakes, ground uplift and subsidence, and gas releases at Yellowstone are commonplace events and do not reflect impending eruptions.     Q: Is the volcano dormant or extinct or still active?   A:  The Yellowstone Volcano is still active. Evidence for the activity of the Yellowstone Volcano are the 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes per year, active ground deformation, and the over 10,000 thermal features found in Yellowstone.     Q: What is Yellowstone doing to prevent an eruption?   A:  Nothing can be done to prevent an eruption. The temperatures, pressures, physical characteristics of partially molten rock, and the immensity of the magma chamber are beyond man's ability to influence--much less control.     Q: How will the park get the word out if there is an eruption?   A:  The park would communicate accurate and timely information to park visitors, park employees, concessioners, surrounding communities, media outlets, and other interested parties through the park's 24-hour Communications Center; news releases; established emergency response programs; and through notification of appropriate interagency, state and local government agencies.     Q: Where would it be safe to be during an eruption?   A:  For the most likely type of volcanic eruption in Yellowstone, everywhere would be safe except in the immediate vicinity of the advancing lava flow. In the highly improbable event of a large catastrophic eruption, the greater the distance from the eruptive center, the safer it would be. It is impossible to know the effects of the eruption without guessing at the explosivity of the highly unlikely eruption and the total amount of the material erupted.     Q: Would the public know about a possible eruption?   A:  Yes. Scientists continuously monitor volcano activity in Yellowstone and share that information through news releases, web sites, etc. Current real-time-monitoring data are online at  http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/monitoring.html .     Q: If Old Faithful quits erupting, is that a sign the volcano is about to erupt?   A:  Geysers are natural phenomena and as such, their behavior is unpredictable and subject to unexpected changes. Old Faithful is unique in that its eruptions have been frequent and relatively consistent during the last century or so of observations. We expect Old Faithful to change in response to the ongoing geologic processes associated with mineral deposition and earthquakes. Thus, a change in Old Faithful Geyser's eruptions will not necessarily indicate a change in volcanic activity.

Historical poster of Yellowstone from 1938       Yellowstone National Park , established by the  U.S. Congress [ 3 ]  as a  national park  on March 1, 1872, is located primarily in the  U.S. state  of  Wyoming , though it also extends into  Montana  and  Idaho . The park was the first of its kind, and is known for its  wildlife  and  its many geothermal features , especially  Old Faithful Geyser , one of the most popular features in the park. [ 1 ]  It has many types of  ecosystems , but the  subalpine   forest  is dominant.   Aboriginal Americans  have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. The region was bypassed during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by  mountain men  during the early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The  U.S. Army  was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the  National Park Service , which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than 1,000 archaeological sites.   Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468 square miles (8,983 km), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and  mountain ranges . [ 1 ]   Yellowstone Lake  is one of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America and is centered over the  Yellowstone Caldera , the largest  supervolcano  on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. [ 4 ]   Lava  flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the largest remaining, nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. [ 5 ]   Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either  endangered  or  threatened . [ 1 ]  The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants.  Grizzlies ,  wolves , and free-ranging herds of  bison  and  elk  live in the park.  Forest fires  occur in the park each year; in the  large forest fires  of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including  hiking ,  camping ,  boating ,  fishing  and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either  snow coaches  or  snowmobile .

Near the end of the  18th century ,  French trappers  named the river ""Roche Jaune,"" which is probably a translation of the  Minnetaree  name "" Mi tsi a-da-zi "" (Rock Yellow River). [ 6 ]  Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as ""Yellow Stone."" Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone , the Native American name source is not clear. [ 7 ]  The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 years ago when aboriginal Americans first began to hunt and fish in the region. During the construction of the post office in  Gardiner, Montana , in the  1950s , an obsidian projectile point of  Clovis  origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago. [ 8 ]  These  Paleo-Indians , of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of  obsidian  found in the park to make such  cutting tools  and  weapons .  Arrowheads  made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the  Mississippi Valley , indicating that a regular obsidian trade existed between local tribes and tribes farther east. [ 9 ]  By the time  white   explorers  first entered the region during the  Lewis and Clark Expedition  in 1805, they encountered the  Nez Perce ,  Crow  and  Shoshone  tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but they did not investigate it. [ 9 ]          Upper Falls of the Yellowstone River       In 1806,  John Colter , a member of the  Lewis and Clark Expedition , left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 18071808. He observed at least one  geothermal  area in the northeastern section of the park, near  Tower Fall . [ 10 ]  After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and  Blackfoot  tribes in 1809, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "" Colter's Hell ."" Over the next forty years, numerous reports from mountain men and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and  petrified  trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be myth. [ 11 ]           Sylvan Lake near the  Cody  entrance to Yellowstone       After an 1856 exploration, mountain man  Jim Bridger  reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns"". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist  Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden , who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper  Missouri River  region. Bridger and United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the  Black Hills  region in what is now the state of  South Dakota , the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The  American Civil War  hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s. [ 12 ]   The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the  Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition  of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to Yellowstone Lake. [ 13 ]  The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the  Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition  in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana  Henry Washburn , and included  Nathaniel P. Langford  (who later became known as ""National Park"" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt.  Gustavus Doane . The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the  Helena Herald  newspaper between 1870 and 1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor  Thomas Francis Meagher , who had previously commented that the region should be protected. [ 14 ]  Others made similar suggestions. In an 1871 letter from  Jay Cooke  to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Congressman  William D. Kelley  had also suggested "" Congress  pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever"". [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Park creation and later history          F.V. Hayden's map of Yellowstone National Park, 1871.       In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. With government sponsorship, Hayden returned to Yellowstone region with a second, larger expedition, the  Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by  William Henry Jackson , as well as paintings by  Thomas Moran . His report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction; on March 1, 1872, President  Ulysses S. Grant  signed  The Act of Dedication  into law that created Yellowstone National Park. [ 16 ]     THE ACT OF DEDICATION [ 3 ]       AN ACT to set apart a certain tract of land lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public park. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the tract of land in the Territories of Montana and Wyoming lying near the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and described as follows, to-wit: Commencing at the junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River and running east to the meridian, passing ten miles (16 km) to the eastward of the most eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along the said meridian to the parallel of latitude, passing ten miles (16 km) south of the most southern point of Yellowstone Lake ; thence west along said parallel to the meridian, passing fifteen miles (24 km) west of the most western point of Madison Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's Rivers; thence east to the place of beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people; and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed there from.       SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same. Such regulations shall provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for building purposes, for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of said leases, and all other revenue that may be derived from any source connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the management of the same and the construction of roads and bridle-paths, and shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and game found within said park and against their capture or destruction for the purpose of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be removed there from, and generally shall be authorized to take all such measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects and purposes of this act.       Approved March 1, 1872.       Signed by:     JAMES G. BLAINE , Speaker of the House.   SCHUYLER COLFAX , Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate.   ULYSSES S. GRANT , President of the United States.              (1870) Portrait of  Nathaniel P. Langford , the first superintendent of the park [ 17 ]       Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. In 1875, Colonel  William Ludlow , who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of  George Armstrong Custer , was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's  Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone Nation Park.  The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist  George Bird Grinnell . Grinnell documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk and antelope for hides. ""It is estimated that during the winter of 18741875, not less than 3,000 buffalo and mule deer suffer even more severely than the elk, and the antelope nearly as much."" [ 18 ]   As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed land management problems first hand,  Philetus Norris  volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these funds to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities. [ 20 ]  Norris hired  Harry Yount  to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger. [ 21 ]  However, these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.          Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters.       The  Northern Pacific Railroad  built a  train station  in  Livingston, Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883. [ 22 ]  Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services, and most access into the park was on horse or via  stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to also attract a  Union Pacific Railroad  connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation fell off considerably by  World War II  and ceased around the 1960s.   Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at  Mammoth Hot Springs  in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures, and Camp Sheridan was renamed  Fort Yellowstone . [ 23 ]  With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, many of the management principles developed by the army were adopted by the new agency. [ 23 ]  The army turned control over to the National Park Service on October 31, 1918. [ 24 ]   By 1915, 1,000 automobiles per year were entering the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited. [ 25 ]  Between 1933 and 1941, the  Civilian Conservation Corps  built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads. During  World War II , staffing and visitation both decreased, and many facilities fell into disrepair. [ 26 ]  By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented  Mission 66 , an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style. [ 27 ]  During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well. [ 28 ]          The  Roosevelt Arch  is located in  Montana  at the North Entrance. The arch's  cornerstone  was laid by  Theodore Roosevelt . The placard reads  ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""       The  1959 Yellowstone earthquake  just west of Yellowstone at  Hebgen Lake  damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid. [ 29 ]  It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.   The  wildfires  during the summer of 1988 were the largest in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880 acres (1,240 sq mi; 321,272 ha) or 36% of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July contributed to an extreme fire danger. On ""Black Saturday,"" August 20, 1988, strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. [ 30 ]   The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000  archeological  sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these  Obsidian Cliff  and five buildings have been designated  National Historic Landmarks . [ 1 ]  Yellowstone was designated an  International Biosphere Reserve  on October 26, 1976, and a  United Nations   World Heritage Site  on September 8, 1978.     [ edit ]   Geography          Yellowstone Lake on an autumn morning              Map of Wyoming showing the Yellowstone National Park       Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63 miles (102 km) north to south, and 54 miles (87 km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789 acres (898,317 ha; 3,468.420 sq mi), Yellowstone is larger than the states of  Rhode Island  and  Delaware  combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (35,220 ha; 136.00 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (122 m) deep and has 110 miles (177 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is  grassland . [ 1 ]           Madison River .       The  Continental Divide  of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a  topographic  feature that separates  Pacific Ocean  and  Atlantic Ocean  water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and  Snake Rivers  are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the  Gulf of Mexico .          Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Note the yellow color of the rocks from which the park gets its name       The park sits on the  Yellowstone Plateau , at an average altitude of 8,000 feet (2,400 m) above  sea level . The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by  mountain ranges  of the  Middle Rocky Mountains , which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,743 to 3,352 m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop  Eagle Peak  (11,358 ft/3,462 m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 ft/1,610 m). [ 1 ]  Nearby mountain ranges include the  Gallatin Range  to the northwest, the  Beartooth Mountains  in the north, the  Absaroka Range  to the east, and the  Teton Range  and the  Madison Range  to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is  Mount Washburn  at 10,243 feet (3,122 m).   Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest  petrified forests , trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290  waterfalls  of at least 15 feet (4.5 m) in the park, the highest being the  Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River  at 308 feet (94 m). [ 1 ]   Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The  Lewis River  flows through  Lewis Canyon  in the south, and the  Yellowstone River  has carved the colorful  Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone  in its journey north.            Yellowstone mountain range           [ edit ]   Geology   Main articles:  Geothermal areas of Yellowstone ,  Yellowstone Caldera , and  Supervolcano          Columnar basalt near Tower Falls; large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice       Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the  Snake River Plain , a great U-shaped arc through the mountains that extends from  Boise, Idaho  some 400 miles (640 km) to the west. This feature traces the route of the  North American Plate  over the last 17 million years as it was transported by  plate tectonics  across a stationary  mantle   hotspot . The landscape of present-day Yellowstone National Park is the most recent manifestation of this hotspot below the  crust  of the Earth. [ 31 ]          Upper Terraces of  Mammoth Hot Springs       The  Yellowstone Caldera  is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "" supervolcano "" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago, which released 240 cubic miles (1,000 km) of ash, rock and  pyroclastic  materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the  1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens . [ 32 ]  It produced a  crater  nearly a two thirds of a mile (1 km) deep and 52 by 28 miles (85 by 45 km) in area and deposited the  Lava Creek Tuff , a  welded tuff   geologic formation . The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, ejected 588 cubic miles (2,450 km) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the  Huckleberry Ridge Tuff  and created the  Island Park Caldera . [ 33 ]  A smaller eruption ejected 67 cubic miles (280 km) of material 1.2 million years ago, forming the  Henry's Fork Caldera  and depositing the  Mesa Falls Tuff . [ 32 ]          Wooden walkways allow visitors to closely approach the  Grand Prismatic Spring .       Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the  extinction  of many species, primarily in North America. [ 34 ]   A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the  West Thumb  of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cycles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows. [ 33 ]   Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied  magma chamber . This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions cannot be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events. [ 35 ]           Steam   Crepuscular rays  at  Mammoth Hot Springs       Between 630,000 and 700,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of  rhyolitic  lavas such as those that can be seen at  Obsidian Cliffs  and  basaltic  lavas which can be viewed at  Sheepeater Cliff . Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic  V-shaped valley , indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by  glaciation .   The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is  Old Faithful Geyser , located in  Upper Geyser Basin .  Castle Geyser ,  Lion Geyser  and  Beehive Geyser  are in the same basin. The park contains the largest active geyser in the world Steamboat Geyser  in the  Norris Geyser Basin . There are 300 geysers in Yellowstone and a total of at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether. Half the geothermal features and two-thirds of the world's geysers are concentrated in Yellowstone. [ 36 ]   In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the  University of Utah  created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region. [ 37 ]           Old Faithful Geyser  erupts approximately every 91 minutes.       In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New  fumaroles  were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and they could no longer erupt normally. [ 38 ]  This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. [ 39 ]  On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. [ 40 ]  In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement had risen at a rate of 1.5 to 2.4 inches (4 to 6 cm) per year from mid2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. [ 43 ]          Castle Geyser eruption              Castle Geyser eruption, 1874       Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least  magnitude  6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge  landslide , which caused a partial dam collapse on  Hebgen Lake ; immediately downstream, the  sediment  from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as  Earthquake Lake . Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs' normally clear water turned muddy. [ 29 ]  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. [ 32 ]  Beginning on April 30, 2007, sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. [ 44 ]  In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. [ 45 ] Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Biology and ecology   Main article:  Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem           Pronghorn  are commonly found on the grasslands in the park.       Yellowstone National Park is the centerpiece of the 20 million acre/31,250 square-mile (8,093,712 ha/80,937 km) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes  Grand Teton National Park , adjacent  National Forests  and expansive  wilderness  areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the United States outside of  Alaska  and is considered to be the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone [ 5 ]  (although the area is mostly not  temperate  but  subalpine , and all the national forest lands surrounding the National Park are not intact). With the successful  wolf reintroduction  program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.     [ edit ]   Flora   1,700  species  of  trees  and other  vascular plants  are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be  exotic species  and are non-native. Of the eight  conifer  tree species documented,  Lodgepole Pine  forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. [ 1 ]  Other conifers, such as  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir  and  Whitebark Pine , are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a  fungus  known as  white pine blister rust ; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. [ 47 ]   Quaking Aspen  and  willows  are the most common species of  deciduous  trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk. [ 48 ]   There are dozens of species of flowering plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September. [ 49 ]  The  Yellowstone Sand Verbena  is a rare flowering plant found only in Yellowstone. It is closely related to species usually found in much warmer climates, making the sand verbena an enigma. The estimated 8,000 examples of this rare flowering plant all make their home in the sandy soils on the shores of Yellowstone Lake, well above the waterline. [ 50 ]   In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria  form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other  arthropods  live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from  sulfur . In 2005, researchers from the  University of Colorado at Boulder  discovered that the sustenance for at least some of the diverse  hyperthermophilic  species is  molecular hydrogen . [ 51 ]   Thermus aquaticus  is a  bacterium  found in the Yellowstone hot springs produces an important  enzyme  that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating  DNA  as part of the  polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. [ 52 ]   Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, both of which are time consuming and expensive. [ 53 ]     [ edit ]   Fauna   Main articles:  Animals of Yellowstone  and  Wolf reintroduction           Bison  graze near a hot spring       Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest  megafauna  wildlife habitat in the  lower 48 states . There are almost 60 species of  mammals  in the park, including the  endangered   gray wolf , the  threatened   lynx , and  grizzly bears . [ 1 ]  Other large mammals include the  bison  (buffalo),  black bear ,  elk ,  moose ,  mule deer ,  mountain goat ,  pronghorn ,  bighorn sheep  and  mountain lion .   The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit  bovine  diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to  brucellosis , a  bacterial  disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause  cattle  to  miscarry . The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the ""likely source"" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and  North Dakota . Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. [ 54 ]  Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The park's bison population reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. [ 55 ]  The Yellowstone herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are in the  Henry Mountains  of  Utah ,  Wind Cave National Park  in  South Dakota  and on Elk Island in  Alberta, Canada . [ 56 ]   To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 199697, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. [ 54 ]   Animal rights  activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone. [ 54 ]   Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of  ""destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry""  on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders, and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves, and wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone. [ 57 ]  Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the  Endangered Species Act  in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed. [ 57 ]  After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the  coyote  then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals, and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.          A reintroduced  gray wolf  in Yellowstone National Park       By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (which oversees threatened and endangered species),  Mackenzie Valley wolves , imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. [ 58 ]  Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 199596. [ 58 ]  The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on Feb 27, 2008 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list. [ 59 ]   An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. [ 60 ]   Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. [ 61 ]  The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the  National Elk Refuge , immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.   In 2003, the tracks of one female lynx and her cub were spotted and followed for over 2 miles (3.2 km). Fecal material and other evidence obtained were tested and confirmed to be those of a lynx. No visual confirmation was made, however. Lynx have not been seen in Yellowstone since 1998, though  DNA  taken from hair samples obtained in 2001 confirmed that lynx were at least transient to the park. [ 62 ]  Other less commonly seen mammals include the mountain lion and  wolverine . The mountain lion has an estimated population of only 25 individuals parkwide. [ 63 ]  The wolverine is another rare park mammal, and accurate population figures for this species are not known. [ 64 ]  These uncommon and rare mammals provide insight into the health of protected lands such as Yellowstone and help managers make determinations as to how best to preserve habitats.   Eighteen species of fish live in Yellowstone, including the core range of the  Yellowstone cutthroat trout a fish highly sought by  anglers . [ 1 ] [ 65 ]  The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of  lake trout , an  invasive species  which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. [ 66 ]  Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. [ 67 ]  The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, as well as the accidental introduction of a parasite whirling disease which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. [ 65 ]  Yellowstone is also home to six species of  reptiles , such as the  painted turtle  and  western rattlesnake , and four species of  amphibians , including the  Boreal Chorus Frog . [ 68 ]   311 species of birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. [ 1 ]  As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare sightings of  whooping cranes  have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known to live in the Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. [ 69 ]  Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the  common loon ,  harlequin duck ,  osprey ,  peregrine falcon  and the  trumpeter swan . [ 70 ]     [ edit ]   Forest fires   See also:  Yellowstone fires of 1988           Wildfire  in Yellowstone National Park produces  Pyrocumulus cloud              Fire in Yellowstone National Park       Wildfire  is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways.  Douglas-fir  has a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires.  Lodgepole Pines  the most common tree species in the park generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish.  Subalpine Fir ,  Engelmann Spruce ,  Whitebark Pine  and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur.  Aspen  trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. [ 71 ]  The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years. [ 71 ]   About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by  lightning , while another six to ten are started by people in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three  fire towers , each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames. [ 72 ]  Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than 100 acres (40 ha), and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5 ha) before they burn themselves out. [ 73 ]  Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed. [ 74 ]          Fire damage to trees giving way to new growth in Yellowstone       In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire.  Controlled burns  are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. [ 75 ]  Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.          A crown fire approaches the Old Faithful complex on September 7, 1988       1988 started with a wet spring season although by summer, drought began moving in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point, courtesy of the  droughts  of 1988 and 1989.  Grasses  and  plants  which grew well in the early summer from the abundant spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began firefighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between July 15 and July 21, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500 acres (3,400 ha; 13.3 sq mi) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000 acres (40,000 ha; 155 sq mi) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together, and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000 acres (61,000 ha; 230 sq mi) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000 acres (321,000 ha; 1,239 sq mi) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage. [ 30 ]  Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the firefighting efforts were killed.   Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,00050,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Climate          Winter scene in Yellowstone       Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98  F  (37  C ) in 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded is -66 F (-54 C) in 1933. [ 1 ]  During the summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80 F (20 to 25 C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0 C)especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by  thunderstorms . Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60 F (0 to 15 C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20 C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20 F (-20 to -5 C) and nighttime temperatures below zero F (-20 C) for most of the winter. [ 76 ]   Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable and ranges from 15 inches (380 mm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80 inches (2,000 mm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the  Snake River Plain  to the west that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself. Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150 inches (3,800 mm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations. [ 76 ]   Tornadoes  in Yellowstone are rare; however, on July 21, 1987, the most powerful tornado recorded in Wyoming touched down in the  Teton Wilderness  of  Bridger-Teton National Forest  and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an  F4 , with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260 mph (333 to 418 km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide, and 24 miles (38 km) long, and leveled 15,000 acres (6,100 ha; 23 sq mi) of mature pine forest. [ 77 ]     [ edit ]   Recreation   Main article:  Trails of Yellowstone National Park   Main article:  Angling in Yellowstone National Park          Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions               Union Pacfic Railway  Brochure Promoting Travel to Park (1921)       Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. [ 78 ]  At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service. [ 1 ]   Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from  Gardiner, Montana , and extends to  Cooke City, Montana , are closed to wheeled vehicles. [ 79 ]  Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid-May. [ 80 ]  The park has 310 miles (499 km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances. [ 1 ]  There is no public transportation available inside the park, but several tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, concessionaires operate guided  snowmobile  and  snow coach  tours. [ 81 ]  Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.          Old Faithful Inn       The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the  Old Faithful Inn  built in 190304 and the entire  Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District . A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons.   Camping  is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. [ 1 ]  Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south.  Backcountry  campsites are accessible only by foot or by  horseback  and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,770 km) of  hiking  trails available. [ 82 ]  The park is not considered to be a good destination for  mountaineering  because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in ""frontcountry"" zones such as drive in campgrounds. [ 83 ]  Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year. [ 84 ]          Vintage photo of visitors feeding bears in spite of the danger              Park Superintendent  Horace M. Albright  and dinner guests, 1922       Hunting  is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season.  Fishing  is a popular activity, and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters [ 85 ] . Many park waters are  fly fishing  only and all native fish species are  catch and release  only [ 86 ] . Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5 mile (8 km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and it is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina, and the lake is the most popular boating destination. [ 87 ]   In the early history of the park, visitors were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. The bears had learned to beg for food, and visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with them. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe them in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. [1]   Other protected lands in the region include  Caribou-Targhee ,  Gallatin ,  Custer ,  Shoshone  and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's  John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway  is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed  Beartooth Highway  provides access from the northeast and has spectacular high altitude scenery. Nearby communities include  West Yellowstone, Montana ;  Cody, Wyoming ;  Red Lodge, Montana ;  Ashton, Idaho ; and  Gardiner, Montana . The closest air transport is available by way of  Bozeman ;  Billings, Montana ;  Jackson ;  Cody, Wyoming  or  Idaho Falls, Idaho . [ 88 ]   Salt Lake City , 320 miles (515 km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.
