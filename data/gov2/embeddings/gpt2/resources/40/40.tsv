GX030-68-7479432	"REGIONAL PROJECT NO.: S-272 DC 95-06            TITLE: Development of Textile Materials for       Environmental Compatibility and Human Health and Safety            DURATION: October 1, 1996, to September 30, 2001            STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM            The U.S. public increasingly recognizes the need       to reduce wastes and/or make products having enhanced biodegradation       potential. This ties in to the need to create value-added products from       agricultural products/wastes/derivatives to achieve economically viable       agricultural production systems. This project involves developing newer       textile materials (value-added products) and processes that will improve       existing textiles and other polymeric materials. The objectives of this       project also address performing consumer end-use testing and making market       acceptability determinations of the innovative products. These research       efforts are expected to lead to the development of environmentally       compatible textile products that contribute to human health and safety,       and also help revitalize the agricultural and rural economics.            JUSTIFICATION            Environmental responsibility is becoming the       cornerstone of most major industries in the United States. Increased       consumer awareness, tighter restrictions, new regulations and increased       enforcement policies during the 1990's have been critical in the       development of new technologies, products and programs that address       environmental issues. Today, substantial evidence indicates that       environmental concerns have a major impact on consumers when making       purchasing decisions. Consumers are willing to pay, on average, 6.6% more       to purchase selected environmentally friendly products (Hager, 1990).       Consumer researcher Wiseman (Apodaca, 1992) and Esprit International       (Brookhart, 1991) stated that awareness of environmental issues also has       influenced company attitudes. Hence, addressing and solving environmental       concerns will continue to have a significant impact on the direction of       research. There is a need for development and assessment of new textile       and other polymeric products and processes that are environmentally       friendly, especially, since textiles are found in an unlimited number and       variety of products.            Six research initiatives were recently outlined       as research priorities (ESCOP, 1994). Under one of these priorities,       Environment and National Resources, the primary focus was on how to       Recover and Use Waste Resources through Agricultural and Forestry Systems.       Under a second priority, Processes and Products, the two major issues were       Processing By-products to Beneficial Uses and the Development of New or       Improved Non-Food Products. And, under a third research priority, Economic       and Social Issues, two important issues, Enhancement of Agricultural and       Rural Economics and Empowering People for Economic and Social Viability,       were addressed. Joint Council on Food and Agricultural Sciences FY 1997,       has also listed their five goals which are similar to ESCOP research       initiatives. The research thrust of the new project will address Joint       Council's first goal which is to achieve economically viable agricultural       production systems that are compatible with environmental and social       values. The new proposed project falls well within the ESCOP high-priority       research initiatives.            Several goals enumerated in the Southern       Strategic Research Plan (Dec. 1994) provide an impetus for continued       development of new textile materials from agricultural waste and       by-products. Development of new value-added products from agricultural       crops and by-products will enhance the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture       and assure American dominance in a global economy. In response to USDA       initiatives and goals, new textile materials from agricultural products       are being developed by Experiment Station scientists. Commercialization of       these products will enhance the profitability of agricultural enterprises       in the US and provide more economic opportunities for producers of these       crops.            The previous research project (S-250) dealt with       the assessment of environmental compatibility of textiles and other       polymeric materials. Solid waste reduction has been demonstrated as one       viable way of dealing with waste; altering existing products to make them       more environmentally friendly may be a better approach in the long run.       This proposed project addresses three major areas of research: (1)       development and characterization of environmentally compatible value-added       products from existing agricultural crops; (2) development and       characterization of processes that will improve existing textile and       polymeric materials, making them safer for human use; and (3) comparison       of the functional performance and marketability of these products with the       competing products already existing in the market. All of these research       objectives can only be achieved or accomplished through cooperative       research because they involve diverse products grown and processed in       various parts of the United States.            Kenaf is being investigated as an alternative       crop for farmers in many states, including California, Mississippi, Texas,       Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The major use for kenaf has       been in the production of pulp for paper, but the appearance of other       kenaf products on the market recently has expanded the use of and interest       in this fiber. Kenaf blends have the potential for penetrating the markets       for disposable nonwovens in the medical field, such as drape sheets, and       sterilization wraps and interior furnishing materials such as wallpaper       and carpet backing. Apparel including high-fashion garments, and where       texture and aesthetics are important, can be constructed of kenaf blends;       however, this may well be a niche situation. Production and evaluation of       prototype woven and nonwoven kenaf fabrics will contribute necessary data       on product quality and utility as agricultural producers consider       investment in kenaf as an alternative crop.            Researchers in Louisiana, a state with       significant sugarcane production, have developed processes for conversion       of sugar cane rind into textile and geotextile products. Traditional sugar       processing crushes the entire sugar cane stalk to obtain the sucrose from       which refined sugar is processed. The crushed stalks, or bagasse,       remaining from such processing have been used in low-value applications       such as fuel for the processing mill or animal feed. Development of higher        value-added products would enhance sugar mill operation and provide       additional end uses for the high volume of bagasse by-product.            Agricultural byproducts obtained from the       Midwest's major commodities (soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and wheat)       potentially could be used to produce a multitude of innovative value-added       non-food products, ranging from fibers and films to finishing agents. For       the last five years, a major research emphasis at Kansas State University       (KSU) has been to examine non-food uses of soybean byproducts in a variety       of textile applications because of its economic importance to the state.       Preliminary work has been done on utilizing a variety of agricultural       by-products in textile manufacturing and processing, such as the potential       use of tocopherols; soybean-based binders in pigment printing;       polyethylene films; and new fiber reactive finishing compounds. Further       work is needed on evaluating the aforementioned compounds.            Water and air pollution from textile processing       is still a major problem. Innovative methods and products to achieve       pollution prevention and source reduction are being addressed by the newly       developed One Atmosphere Plasma Process and Low Pressure Plasma Treatment       at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville) and Wisconsin. Applications for       these processes include the treatment of melt blown nonwovens made of       normally unwettable polypropylene (PP) making them wettable. These plasm       processes can also make other synthetic fabrics more wettable so they can       be dyed and printed with the more environmentally friendly water soluble       dyes and pigments as opposed to solvent based systems.            An area related to indoor air quality is the       maintenance of indoor relative humidity. As indoor relative humidities       increase, occupant comfort decreases while the probability of allergic       reactions and pathogenic illnesses increase. In addition to the health       risks, high indoor relative humidities have an adverse effect on building       materials. Moisture absorption/desorption in building materials,       especially fabrics, can have significant effects on cooling       dehumidification devices. Fabrics normally found in the interior of       buildings (cotton, rayon) can be used to develop a fabric/desiccant window       cavity dehumidifier that uses solid desiccants embedded in the fabric       structure to dehumidify room air in commercial and residential buildings.            The wearing of protective apparel is highly       recommended for all people occupationally exposed to ultraviolet       radiation, sunlight, pesticides, blood and body fluids. Therefore, there       is a continued interest in the development of textile systems for human       safety, namely, medical, agricultural and sun protective clothing.            The large numbers of patents known to be infected       with bloodborne pathogens makes it vital for all healthcare providers to       use precaution and treat all body fluids as infectious. The precarious       nature of this work makes it critical that all healthcare employers       determine the risk of infection of their employees and equip them with the       required level of protective apparel in compliance with the Occupational       Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. The OSHA estimates that       more than 5.6 million healthcare and public safety workers are at       potential risk of being exposed to human immunodeficiency (HIV) or       hepatitis B (HBV) viruses (OSHA, 1992). Accordingly, OSHA has issued a       mandate on personal protective equipment (PPE) with the long term goal of       reducing the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne viruses. PPE       items include surgical gowns, drapes, aprons, and masks.            Concern among healthcare professionals about       infection has created a heightened interest in nonwovens research to       develop barrier materials providing the highest level of protection. Also,       the environmental costs of medical waste disposal are rising, and a survey       of medical protective clothing use suggests that, for both purchasers and       wearers of medical clothing, biodegradability will be of concern (Brandt &       Swift, 1993). This creates the unique opportunity for agricultural fibers       such as kenaf and cotton to be included in composite nonwoven structures       for such medical applications. Natural fibers have two distinctive       advantages over synthetics: they are moisture absorbent and therefore more       comfortable; and they are biodegradable, making them ideal for disposable       products.            Skin cancer rates have increased dramatically       over the past 50 years, most of them caused by excessive exposure to       ultraviolet radiation from the sun (Jaroff, 1990). In recent years many       individuals began to use chemical sunscreens rather than clothing for       photoprotection. However, sunscreens frequently are not uniformly applied       and are removed or diminished in efficacy by water or sweating. In       addition, sunscreens cause hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals        thereby limiting or precluding their use. Consequently, there is renewed       interest in the development and evaluation of sun-protective clothing.            Another area of interest related to       sun-protective clothing is  Acetobacter xylinum  cellulose which       can be a potential candidate for value added textile products,       specifically products that can provide UVR protection. In addition, the       secreted cellulose can be molded or shaped to specific forms such as caps       and gloves.  Acetobacter xylinum  is a gram negative soil       bacterium that secretes cellulose. The cellulose synthesized is chemically       and structurally identical to that produced by higher plants. Therefore,       possibilities of producing a value-added product from this bacterium       exist.            The Agricultural Worker Protection Standards       specify that the required PPE and clothing be listed on pesticide product       labels. Because most protective clothing specified is reused,       pesticide-contaminated protective clothing needs to be decontaminated       before reuse to minimize human exposure. Previous studies have indicated a       need for research on understanding the sorption and retention properties       of the innovative textile substrates in a protective clothing system to        provide a theoretical framework for chemical retention and release from       textile substrates (newly developed and existing fabrics).            This multi-faceted research agenda must be       well-organized, and a cooperative effort is the only feasible way to       accomplish all the goals of the project within a reasonable period of       time. Also, some laboratories are better equipped to carry out particular       aspects of the research. For example, the University of Tennessee,       Louisiana State University, Kansas State University, and Mississippi State       University are in the forefront of product development research. Other       research laboratories such as the University of Nebraska, University of       Georgia, University of Kentucky, Purdue University, University of       Wisconsin, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Florida State       University, Auburn University, and University of Arkansas have the       expertise to characterize fabrics, evaluate functional performance,       conduct environmental compatibility research and determine marketability.            The objectives listed in this proposal can only       be accomplished efficiently through cooperative research studies. In       total, we have capable scientists from 13 universities/experiment stations       that have pledged their support and participation. The broad spectrum of       scientific and technical expertise offered by the participating       cooperative states is of the highest caliber and includes textile       chemistry, agricultural value-added product development research,       fabrication, wear-study, environmental sciences, environmental toxicology,       consumer acceptance and market assessibility. Many different crops,       processing facilities, textile testing equipment, and a great variety of       nonwoven equipment/facilities are needed to accomplish the objectives       outlined herein. No single university/experiment station alone has the       full resources required to produce the value-added products and adequately       assess end-use performance characteristics. Also, funding required to       accomplish such broad and comprehensive research goals is substantial.       Therefore, RRF funding is required and necessary.            The significance of the research proposal       presented, the broad and comprehensive model for the holistic approach to       value-added product development research, and the cooperation of the 10       states fit very well with the mission of an RRF project. This project is       the only cooperative effort addressing the various topics related to       value-added product development, processes to improve textile and       polymeric materials, consumer-end-use performance testing and market       acceptability of these innovative products.            Results of the proposed research project will       benefit agricultural producers by providing higher returns;       manufacturers/industries by making/selling environmentally friendly       products; and consumers by providing high quality product alternatives.       This cooperative research effort will add value to agricultural products       and create new business/product opportunities that will help revitalize       the agricultural and rural economics by minimizing the environmental and       economic impacts of wastes which can be converted into usable products.            Contributions to science and technology will       include product development, consumer-end-use performance of these       products, market acceptability of environmentally friendly products,       environmentally compatible new production processes, determination of the       economic viability of local industries based on alternative uses of       agricultural and renewable resources, and development of appropriate       technology to support these industries.            RELATED CURRENT AND PREVIOUS WORK            Regional project S-250, Assessment of the       Environmental Compatibility of Textiles and Other Polymeric Materials       (terminates September 30, 1996) focused on the assessment of environmental       compatibility, weather and photodegradation, and soil composting of a       variety of fiber and filament materials. It also investigated the       possibility of incorporating agricultural products into non-woven       materials and the possibility of using recycled polyester in the       construction of nonwoven fabrics. The proposed research described herein       will investigate the characteristics, performance and market potential of       altered agricultural by-products (or value-added products). Improved       processes that will make textile and polymeric materials more       environmentally friendly and useful for human health and safety, will be       studied.            Equipment, processes and expertise relative to       fiber (kenaf and sugar cane) processing, non-food soybean by-products       synthesis, plasma-membrane finishing, soil burial protocols, etc., which       were developed through S-250 project will be utilized in the proposed       project under some of the objectives listed.            Under the AGRICOLA system, all the listed       research related to this project has an environmental compatibility       aspect, however, all these projects have been or are soon to be       terminated. In general, these studies support the need for more research       on the development of various environmentally friendly processes and       products. Functional performance and market potential are very significant       areas of research.             Development of New Value-Added       Agricultural By-Products and Processes.            In 1986 the Kenaf Demonstration Project was       started in cooperation with USDA and Kenaf International with the primary       goal of making the kenaf industry a reality in the U.S. Kenaf newsprint       has proven to be a market-ready commodity. In 1991 efforts on kenaf began       to focus more on market development for separated kenaf fiber products       made from bast and core materials (Taylor and Kugler, 1992).            Work has been done to develop methods for       processing fibers (Ramaswamy et al., 1993a, 1994a). In addition, research       on differences in fiber quality of kenaf varieties has been conducted       (Ramaswamy et al., 1993b, Boyd et al., 1993). The next phase has involved       processing fibers so that they may be incorporated into nonwoven and woven       textiles (Ramaswamy et al., 1994a, 1994b, 1995a). Various treatments for       obtaining soft, pliable fibers were screened and tested to select the best       process for large-scale production (Ramaswamy & Craft, 1994c;       Ramaswamy et al., 1995b).            A recent trend in bast/leaf fiber research is the       search for unconventional fibers to be used in fabrics. The apparel       industry, especially women's ready-to-wear and haute couture, is always       looking for interesting textures. Kenaf/cotton blends could provide that       exciting texture for this limited market. Also, kenaf/cotton fabrics may       have a promising future in industrial fabrics for end-uses such as       wallcovering and carpet backing and for upholstery and draperies.            Appearance is another major characteristic of a       textile product which determines it acceptability by consumers.       Specifically, new fibers must be able to accept dyes and finishes in order       to meet aesthetic and performance property expectations. The permeability       of a fiber is typically regarded as the most crucial aspect of a fiber's       ability to be dyed or finished. Knowledge about the permeability of a dye       in a fiber, both in terms of the speed and volume of dyeing, is critical       for the dyeing industry. Specifically, this knowledge can be translated       into cost savings for the dyer by knowing which dyeing conditions will       produce better dye yield, leveling, fixation, and colorfastness properties       (McGregor, 1980).            Sugar cane is produced in large quantities in       several southern states. In most current processing, the cane stalks are       crushed to extract the sugar, and the crushed stalks, or bagasse, are then       used for fuel or mulch or are discarded. Attempts to find economical uses       for this by-product have not been particularly successful. Researchers at       Louisiana State University (LSU) have developed processes for extracting       the longer, finer fibers from the rind of sugar cane after separating it       from the pith that contains shorter thicker fibers (Collier & Arora,       1995; Collier, B.J., et al., 1995a; Collier, et. al., 1992a). The process       (patent pending) uses the Tilby separator to remove the pith from the rind       and alkaline treatment and/or steam explosion to extract fibers from the       rind. Sugar cane rind fibers were formed into nonwoven mats and compared       with commercial erosion control mats in laboratory tests (Collier, J.R.,       et al., 1995b; Thames, et al., 1994).            <             A current field study of sugar cane mats and       commercial products is being conducted in cooperation with the Louisiana       Transportation Research Center (LTRC). Preliminary work has begun on       producing mat or spray-on erosion control materials directly from bagasse,       without the separation of rind and pith. LSU scientists have used similar       extraction processes to obtain fibers from kenaf stalks. Kenaf mats,       similar to the sugar cane erosion control mats, were produced and        evaluated. Properties were similar to those of the sugar cane materials.       Further product modifications and trials are needed to assess the       marketability of these geotextile products.            A variety of non-food application of soybean       byproducts for textile applications have been investigated at KSU.       Czarnecki and Gatewood (1995) evaluated the potential use of alpha- and       delta-tocopherois to reduce light degradation in silk, cotton, polyester,       and nylon. However, they were not effective in reducing degradation in the       synthetic fibers, and had a pro-oxidant effect, which would limit their       commercial usefulness. One important non-food use for soybean oil has been       in the manufacturing of alkyd binders which are incorporated into various       coating formulations. Results of printing trials conducted on cotton and       cotton/polyester blend fabrics show that the ease of application,       sharpness of print, and depth of shade of the alkyd binders are comparable       to the conventional acrylic binder, but the fastness to laundering,       dry-cleaning, and crocking was slightly less. The alkyd binder pigment       printing systems show considerable promise, but additional work is needed       to improve fastness properties.            Hamilton and Gatewood (1994) investigated soybean       protein as an alternative filler because of the extensive limitations of       the starch-filled plastic trash bags. Currently, KSU scientists have       successfully prepared polyethylene films containing 40% fatty acids. Also       to be explored is the feasibility of incorporating the fatty acids into       other melt spun fibers and plastics (polyamides and polyethylene       terephthalate) to enhance biodegradability. The oils and fatty acids in        soybeans can also be used to synthesize a wide variety of finishing agents       and auxiliaries for textile dyeing and finishing. Srinivasan (1995)       synthesized a unique fiber reactive softener based on an unsaturated       soybean fatty acid (oleic acid) and cyanuric chloride. The newly       synthesized softener reduced stiffness and improved the flame resistance       of cotton. This basic chemistry offers numerous possibilities for the use       of soybean derivatives in textile processing and finishing.            Development of Processes to Improve       Environmental Compatibility of Textiles and Polymeric Materials            The textile industry has been ranked as the       seventh-worst polluter of the United States waters by the Environmental       Protection Agency under section 304( 1 ) of the Clean       Water Act (CWA) (LaMenzo, 1993). The large quantity of water and variety       of solvents, metals and other target chemicals used in processing       contribute to this ranking. Across all industries, the cost to comply with       treatment for the pollutants is overwhelming. It has been estimated that       the cost for treating metal alone will be between 90 and 105 billion       dollars (Nichols, 1992). Therefore, modifying processes to be more       environmentally friendly is a sensible alternative requiring immediate       attention. Introduction of Tencel®, a cellulosic fiber made via a       solvent spinning process that does not pollute, genetically colored cotton       and organic cotton are a few examples of the new trends seen in the       textile marketplace. These products have a positive environmental image       and are desired by the consumer.            Another topic that raises increased concern is       the quality of indoor air (Baer, 1992). This concern has led to the       evaluation of textiles and textile containing products in indoor       environments. Studies            have shown that indoor air is more polluted than       outdoor air, especially in ""tight"" buildings (Legwold, 1994).       Factors that affect indoor air quality are finishes, furnishings, building       materials, people activity and technology. Topical finishes on fabrics       contain hazardous ingredients that may exist as latent primary emissions.       Commercial durable press finishes for cotton and cotton blends contain       formaldehyde which can be released under hot humid conditions. Concern has       been expressed both in the U.S. and abroad over the health hazard of such       formaldehyde release. Standard measurement methods are static, determining       formaldehyde release under equilibrium specified conditions; therefore       they do not stimulate actual use conditions.            To determine formaldehyde release under       conditions that simulate actual use, a dynamic chamber for exposure to       durable press fabrics has been developed by scientists at the Southern       Regional Research Center, New Orleans. However, the chamber does not       control temperature and humidity independently. An apparatus developed at       LSU features computer control of two valves for control of wet and dry air       flow which will determine the relative humidity in the chamber. Previous        work determined that release of formaldehyde was lower at higher       temperatures for each of two relative humidities tested (Collier et al.,       1992b). A model has been developed to predict formaldehyde release under a       variety of conditions and can also be used to determine the relative       contribution of fabric type and finish to release.            Research has shown that indoor relative humidity       levels above 50% increase the dust mite population, and indoor relative       humidity levels above 70% provide an excellent environment for growth of       fungi (Sterling et al. 1985). Fungi and dust mites are identifiable causes       of asthma and hay fever. Infiltration of high-humidity air (through doors,       windows, cracks, or walls) has been reported to produce condensed moisture       on walls, cause vinyl materials (wall paper) to pull from surfaces, and       break down gypsum dry wall (Shakun 1992; Aulbach et al, 1991). Residential       air conditioners (a potential solution to humidity problems) have been       described as being inadequate to control indoor humidity for hot and humid       climates (Kohlos 1981). Hunn et al. (1994) evaluated fabrics--for shades,       curtains, wall coverings, or other interior furnishings--and system       concepts that employ these fabrics, which absorb and desorb water vapor so       as to dehumidify room air. The results indicated that the proposed       fabric/desiccant window cavity dehumidifier exhibits satisfactory       dehumidification performance. More work is needed to identify other types       of desiccants (that have good moisture absorption desorption properties)       to be used in the fabric/desiccant window cavity dehumidifier.            Researchers at the Textiles and Nonwovens       Development Center (TANDEC) at the University of Tennessee (TN) have       developed the means to make hydrophobic fibers such as polypropylene (PP)       wettable and even rewettable for an extended length of time. This new       affinity for water should increase the accessability of the fibers to dyes       and finishes, and thereby enable lower energy processing with less       pollution (Tsai et al., 1994). The technology is based on a novel       atmospheric plasma reactor, which is capable of generating a uniform,       steady state glow discharge plasma at one atmosphere in air and other       gases. The active species from this plasma can be applied to fabrics as       part of a continuous production process (Roth et al., 1993). Some of the       variables which must be controlled are the gas or gas mixture used; the       exposure time; the type of fabric; the magnitude of the RF electric field       and its frequency; the gas flow rate and flow geometry; and the ambient       temperature and humdity. Each of these variables produces an effect on the       wettability, wickability, and other surface features of the fabric, which       affect its commercial utility.            The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA)       analyses of treated melt-blown PP fibers has confirmned that durability of       the hydrophilic effect is achieved under optimum conditions. Thus, it may       not be necessary for the fabrics or other plasma treated materials to be       immediately dyed or printed, as would typically be the case. Furthermore,       the plasma treated and dyed or printed PET and PP textiles may be mroe       comfortable to wear and have greater versatility if the hydrophilic       property can be maintained. There are some challenges that need to be       faced, such as: which wettability and wickability characteristics are of       commercial interest; which independent variables will produce the desired       characteristics for dyeing and printing applications; and which physical       mechanism(s) wil produce the desired effects on the surface.            Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have       worked on synthetic and natural fibers to improve their physical and       chemical properties. They used low pressure plasma treatment to improve       dyeability, printability, water absorbency/repellency, surface grafting       and metalizing to generate protective layers with enhanced properties of       abrasion resistance, surface hardness, heat resistance and electric       conductivity (Ying, et al, 1995, Sarmadi, et al (in press), Sarmadi and        Denes (in press), Sarmadi, et al, 1995a, Sarmadi, et. al., 1993, Sarmadi,       et. al., 1993b).            Development of Textile Systems for Human       Health and Safety.            The Occupational Safety and Health Administration       passed regulation in 1991 that require employers to provide workers       exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids with garments       that are effective barrier to blood and blood borne pathogens (OSHA,       1992). In addition to health care workers, patients must be provided       protection in the form of surgical wraps, drapes and other textile       products that protect them by preventing fluid or liquid penetration.       These textile systems must be resistant to penetration of bacteria, virus,       blood and other body fluids and should be safely disposed. Many of the       textile systems developed in this project will be good candidates for       medical protective clothing.            The protective clothing of agricultural workers       is assumed to protect workers from exposure to pesticides. However, when       clothing containing pesticide residues comes in contact with skin in the       presence of moisture, particularly perspiration, water-soluble pesticides       can be absorbed into the body, which may cause potentially serious health       hazards. Fabrics should not wet or wick the pesticide formulation, blood       or body fluids. Recent studies (Hobbs, et al, 1986; Sarmadi, et al, 1993c)       have also shown that fabrics treated with low surface tension liquid       repellents (LSTLR) such as fluorochemical (FC) treatment, have enhanced       barrier properties against liquid penetration.            An expanse of literature can be found concerning       laundering methods, variables, and efficiency in removing pesticide       residues (Laughlin and Gold, 1988, Easter, 1983). The sorption and       retention properties of pesticide chemicals by the textile substrate are       the most important variables in determination of chemical exposure to, and       removal from, protective clothing. Sorption isotherms of insecticide can       be easily adapted to measure the retention capacity of textile substrates.       Sorption isotherms may provide a relatively quick and inexpensive method       for obtaining basic information needed to compare the quantity of       pesticides retained by the various textile substrates that will be tested       in this project for use as agricultural protective clothing.            Liquid flow measurements are very critical to the       performance of these newly altered textile structures, for protective       clothing. Wilhelmmy Balance techniques can also be used to determine the       surface energetics of single fibers by measuring the attractive forces       across the interface between a liquid surface and a partially immersed       fiber (Miller and Young, 1975). Liquid flow in porous materials is       commonly described by the Washburn equation (1921), which state that the        distance (H) traveled by the liquid is directly proportional to the square       root of time (t). Measurements of liquid flow through the newer textile       structures that are developed will help to understand the performance of       these structures.            Sun protection programs promote the use of sun       protective clothing in addition to sunscreen and avoidance of continual       exposure. Sun exposure causes damage such as sunburn, skin cancer and       premature aging. Clothing is a highly effective and easy form of       protection compared to sunscreens which require frequent application and       sometimes cause hypersensitivity. Berne and Fischer (1980) examined       various textiles and found that tightly woven materials and darker colors       offered best protection from the sun. Welsh and Diffey (1981) also       reported that fabric structure was the critical factor in determining the       sun-protective value of a textile and not color or thickness. Robson and       Diffey (1990) also confirmed that the fabric construction was more       critical than fiber content; however, they excluded nylons in their study.       Jevtic (1990) studied human exposure to solar simulator and concluded that       a wet fabric will provide less protection. Unfortunately, in the studies       conducted to date, the textiles were imcompletely and even inaccurately       characterized. A review article (Capjack et al. 1994) summarizes findings       and limitations of previous research. Further studies are needed to       systematically investigate the parameters (fabric construction, fiber       content, color and finish) that influence sun protective value of textile       systems.            Another       important area in sun protection is the cellulose produced by  Acetobacter         xylinum . Work by Williams and Cannon (1989) suggests that the       cellulose produced by  Acetobacter   xylinum  has the       capability of protecting bacterial cells from ultraviolet light exposure.       Kuga and Brown, Jr. (1989) analyzed the correlation between the       crystalline structure and the biogenic mechanism and suggested that the       crystalline structure and the presence of the pores through which the       cellulose is extruded contributes to strength, moisture absorbency, and       dyeability of the cellulose produced. However, no evidence of quantitative       data for these properties or others have been found in the literature.       Therefore,  Acetobacter   xylinum  will be cultured and       studied for its sun protective properties.            OBJECTIVES            1. To develop and characterize innovative textile       and related materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis       on agricultural fibers and by-products            2. To assess the environmental compatibility of       selected and newly developed, processes, materials and products from       fibers of polymeric and agricultural origin            3. To evaluate the functional performance,       consumer acceptance and potential commercialization of textile materials       for human health and safety and/or value-added products            PROCEDURES            Objective 1. To develop and       characterize innovative textile and related materials from natural and       synthetic polymers with an emphasis on agricultural fibers and by-products            Development of new value added products       from kenaf and sugar cane and other agricultural crops.            At MSU kenaf fibers will be produced by chemical       retting, softened, and mechanically carded to obtain staple fibers.       Kenaf/cotton yarns will be spun and woven as filling yarns with 100%       cotton warp yarns in plain, twill, basket, and satin weaves.       Characterization of the woven fabrics will include: tensile strength,       tearing strength, abrasion resistance, stiffness, moisture regain, air       permeability, dyeing behavior, colorfastness to laundering, light,       crocking, and perspiration and evaluation of soil repellent and flame       retardant finishes. Kenaf fibers produced at MSU will also be blended with       PP in an 80:20 ratio and carded to make nonwoven webs. The webs will be       needle punched and cured at high pressures to make nonwoven fabrics for       wall-covering substrates. Webs will also be calendered to produce nonwoven       textiles for furniture underlays, mattress liners, and other disposable       products. These products will be characterized and compared with current       commercial products for thickness, weight, tearing strength, abrasion       resistance, stiffness and tensile strength and also compared with product       performance specifications. Since no one station has all the testing       equipment required, various combinations of tests will be performed at       various laboratories (MS, FL, IN, and GA).            At LSU fibers extracted from kenaf and sugar cane       rind will be characterized and spun into yarns. Textile spinning equipment       suitable for processing long-staple fibers will be acquired with a grant       awarded by the Louisiana Education Quality Support Fund (LEQSF). Yarns and       knitted fabric from the yarns will be characterized and will also be dyed       to determine the dyeing characteristics of the sugar cane and kenaf       textiles. Nonwoven mats of bagasse will be produced by alkaline treatment       of bagasse and subsequent screening to eliminate shorter fibers. The mats       will be evaluated for strength, water resistance, light penetration,       biodegradation and flammability and compared to earlier benchmark data       obtained for the 100% rind fibers (Collier, J. R., et al, 1995; Thames, et       al, 1994). Formulations will be developed for a spray-on erosion control       product using sugar cane or kenaf fibers and guar gum (LA, AL, and GA).            These studies will be conducted by the       cooperation of MS, IN, FL, GA, LA and AL. Mississippi and Louisiana will       assume coordination and leadership responsibilities. Product development       work, characterizations and field studies will be done by MS and LA. The       basic research in dyeing of kenaf and/or sugar cane incorporated textiles       will be performed in cooperation with IN. Many of the mechanical and       physical properties will also be performed by FL and GA in cooperation        with MS and LA. Data from two to three stations will be collectively       analyzed and inter-laboratory comparisons made. Interdependence and       cooperation among various states will be reflected in joint publications       in highly respected research journals. Several standard ASTM and AATCC       test methods have been identified and the specifics will be determined       when project approval is obtained. This research is clearly recognized as       being largely developmental in nature and a substantial degree of risk of       failure is evident. However, the potential for developing new value-added       products from agricultural crops is considered as worthy justification for       the studies.            Development of polymeric materials from       agricultural derivatives and evaluate their physical properties and       suitability for specific end-uses.            Films and related polymeric materials will be       produced by incorporating soybean fatty acids into synthetic polymer to       enhance biodegradability. A two-step film preparation method using a Wiley       Mill grinder, a CSI laboratory extruder, and a Carver press will be       adapted to make films under high temperature and pressure. The Carver       press also can be used to mold the films into specific products. The       laboratory prepared films will be tested for variations in thickness,       weight, strength, stiffness, melting point, color and opacity, and       biodegradability using appropriate AATCC and ASTM test methods. After       evaluating the physical properties and performance characteristics of the       films, possible product categories will be explored. Also to be explored       is the feasibility of producing a wheat straw board using modified wheat       starch as a resinous binder (KS, GA).            Additional fiber reactive softeners will be       synthesized from linoleic and linoleic acids from soybean oil and compared       with commercial fabric softeners. The soybean-based fiber reactive       softeners will be applied to cotton fabrics by a pad-dry-cure procedure       using a Mathis pad-steam range, simulating commercial open width       finishing. The stiffness, whiteness, strength, elongation, absorbency,       flammability, and other attributes of the fabrics treated with the       conventional and experimental softeners will be evaluated using standard       AATCC and ASTM test procedures, and compared to the softener from oleic       acid (KS, NC).            The development and characterization of polymeric       materials from soybean derivatives will be conducted by KS, GA and NC with       KS assuming coordination and leadership responsibilities. Films and other       polymeric materials, softeners will be made by KS and further       characteristics, product testing will be done in cooperation with GA and       NC. For example GA will conduct x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to       evaluate biodegradation of the above polymeric materials. Evaluation of        the fiber reactive softeners will be done both by KS and NC. Data will be       compared between two or more laboratories and jointly analyzed.       Publications will reflect interdependence and cooperation. Comparisons of       costs of the soybean derivatives and other similar derivatives will be       made.            Development of One Atmosphere Plasma       Treatment for Lower Energy Consumption and Less Polluting Processing of       Polymeric Materials.            Nonwoven, woven and knitted fabrics will be       exposed to a systematically varied range of parameters which affect the       wettability, wickability and subsequent wet processing of the fabrics.       This will establish the conditions under which an in-line industrial       atmospheric plasma process should function to produce acceptable dyed or       printed fabrics with minimum air and water pollution. This will require       the development of novel plasma diagnostic methods for this one atmosphere        glow discharge, to measure the power density, electron number density,       electron kinetic temperature, ion kinetic temperature, operating voltage,       rms electric field, RF frequency, as well as gas flow characteristics such       as flow rate, composition, humidity, and uniformity of the flow pattern.            The fabrics will be characterized before and       after plasma surface treatments using the techniques of x-ray       photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA), ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy and scanning       electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with measurement of the contact       angle, surface tension, wettability, wickability, and the quality of dyed       and printed fabrics that can be produced (TN, GA, AR, and NC).            TN will develop many of the diagnostic methods       and apply the treatment. Since the techniques for characterization are       very specialized, each state uses a different technique to characterize       the fabrics before and after plasma treatment. Results will be compared       between techniques to reflect understanding of the effects of the plasma       treatment.            Development of Low Pressure Plasma       Treatment and Cotton/Microporous Film Based Nonwovens with Enhanced       Barrier and Comfort Properties.            A hot melt adhesive will be melt blown between       the interfaces of nonwoven substrates, cotton webs, and microporous       polyethylene films, thereby enabling the layered structures to be bonded       at ambient conditions between a low pressure nip. Instead of using thermal       point bonding, the pressure sensitive adhesive will be melt blown to       produce a very light weight web of 3-5 g/m2 which can bond the laminate       layers at the interfaces as the laminate is passed between a single nip of       rubber coated rollers. At least five different fabric compositions will be       prepared at a width of one meter based upon adhering different weights of       melt blown and spunbond polypropylene nonwovens to an inner core of       microporous polyethylene filler/cotton based nonwoven. By virtue of their       unique combination of barrier and comfort properties, it is believed that       these laminates will be suitable candidates for protective apparel       (medical, agricultural and industrial) (TN, WI, GA, KY).            Kenaf/PP webs will be processed to make nonwoven       fabrics and treated with low pressure plasma treatment for surgical       sterilization wraps. Cotton in various nonwoven structures will be       produced using selected bonding mechanisms and evaluated for physical       characteristics. Testing of all fabrics for stability in water, reuse and       dyeing processes, absorption and moisture transfer properties, frictional       characteristics and sewability will be conducted (AL, AR and MS).            TN and WI will develop the appropriate conditions       for the treatments and the fabrics will be characterized using       laboratories in TN, WI, GA, AL, AR, KY, and MS. The same fabrics will be       used in Objective 3 for functional performance. Data from cooperating       laboratories will be jointly analyzed and published to reflect cooperation       of various laboratories and states.            Objective       2. To assess the environmental compatibility of selected and newly       developed, processes, materials and products from fibers of polymeric and       agricultural origin            Assessment of the environmental       compatibility of selected and newly developed processes, materials and       products.            Soil burial of newly developed textiles to assess       the effects of various soil characteristics on their biodegration will be       completed. Textiles produced from kenaf, sugarcane, recycled plastics, and       plastics containing soybean fatty acid fillers will be buried in four soil       types for a total of 128 weeks. Physical properties will be measured at       predetermined intervals to monitor their degradation. Nonwoven, woven and       knit fabrics of PET and PP exposed to the novel atmospheric plasma reactor       will also be evaluated for biodegradability in soil burial studies (AR,       KS, LA, MS, TN, GA, WI and AR). In addition, three plain woven fabrics       containing 100% organic cotton, 100% high-impact (conventionally grown),       and 100% Tencel® will be buried in two different soils of different pH       levels for 32 and 64 weeks. Because materials which are almost 100%       cellulose will decay when buried in soil, these three fabrics will be       buried along with a fourth synthetic fabric which will serve as a       statistical check. Changes in physical properties of tensile strength,       tear resistance and flex abrasion, will be measured before and after       burials. Soil analyses will be performed at these same test periods.            AR will assume leadership responsibilities for       soil burial studies, as they have had excellent success with soil burial       protocols. Textile materials made by KS, MS, TN, and LA will be used in       soil burial tests. MS will take the responsibility for soil sample       analyses for all states. Results and data will be shared with cooperating       states, so data can be jointly analyzed and published.                         Modeling the effect of absolute humidity       on durable press fabrics (release of formaldehyde) and other products.            Two different fabrics, 100% cotton print cloth       and 100% cotton twill will be finished with two current durable press       reactants: dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) and urea formaldehyde       (UF). A finish being developed at Auburn University (AL) will also be       applied. The finished fabrics will be exposed at various temperatures and       humidities. Air flowing past the samples will be collected in water, and       analyzed colorimetrically for formaldehyde using chromotropic acid.        Formaldehyde release will be determined for each fabric at each condition.            Moisture regain characteristics of cotton and       rayon fabrics sewn to a fine net structure containing solid desiccants       (i.e., silica gel beads, bacteria generated cellulose) will be measured at       more than two locations (old vs. newer building). For each sample, the       moisture regain will be determined when exposed to constant relative       humidities of 40% and 60% and at a constant temperature (to be       determined). Each sample will be dried in an infrared dryer for about 75       min. to assure essentially zero moisture content at the beginning of each       test. The dry weight will be recorded. The samples will be weighted on an       electronic balance in an environmental chamber that has been preset at the       desired humidity condition, and weighed at four-minute intervals until the       sample reaches saturation. A time series plot of the sample will be       recorded (LA, AL and NC).            LA will coordinate the efforts of LA, AL and NC       for this part of the research and assume leadership responsibilities.                   Objective       3. To evaluate the functional performance, consumer acceptance and       potential commercialization of the textile materials for human health and       safety and/or value-added products            Resistance to pesticides .            Innovative textile structures produced in this       project will be used. Since alachlor, atrazine, and methyl parathion are       widely used pesticides, they will be selected for this project.       Concentrations will be prepared for each insecticide and herbicide using       technical grade pesticides. The solution will be spiked to fabric samples       with equal amounts of 14C label Pesticides, Sorption coefficients of the       pesticides will be determined by fitting the data to the Fruendlich        equation by nonlinear regression method using the SigmaPlot graphics       package. The Sorption coefficients of the selected pesticide chemicals       will be related to textile substrate characteristics of fiber content,       hydrophobicity, swelling capacity, weave, fabric weight and finish using a       descriptive analysis method. (NC and FL)            The effects of wear abrasion on the barrier       properties of both woven and nonwoven protective apparel fabrics that are       being developed as well as for products currently on the market will be       also investigated. Fabrics will be subjected to moderate abrasion using       standard tests for abrasion and tested for changes in liquid penetration       and other liquid/fabric interactions. Results will be compared to abrasion       caused by subjects wearing the fabrics while working. (FL and NC)            NC and FL will cooperate and NC will coordinate       and assume the leadership responsibilities.            Resistance to synthetic blood, virus and       bacteria.            Newly developed and untreated fabrics will be       evaluated for water resistance and impact penetration using water and       synthetic blood; demand wettability and contact angle will be measured       also for the nonwoven textiles made in this project. (TN, GA and WI)            GA will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities.                                Resistance to solar radiation.            The problem of skin cancer is, of course, of       great interest to people with light colored skins as they get older       previous exposures start to show their results. Most of the parameters       that create sun protection in fabrics are fairly obvious and are rather       easily measured. Opaqueness to visible light, which correlates very well       to opaqueness to UV in fabrics, can be evaluated quickly. These studies       should show the degree to which tighter weaves will give greater       protection than loosely woven or knitted fabric.            A selection of new textile materials developed       and marketed for sun-protective clothing will be evaluated for       sun-protection. A wide selection of textiles that vary by fiber content,       fabric construction, and UV absorbing finishes will be evaluated for their       photo-protective effects and durability to use and care. Appropriate       standardized test procedures developed and published by ASTM and AATCC       will be followed. Durability of the products in use will be assessed by       laboratory tests including breaking strength, tearing strength, and       abrasion resistance. Durability of the photo-protective properties to       laundering will be assessed. The Comparative UV blocking abilities of the       selected textile products will be evaluated by UV-visible       spectrophotometric measurements. Because tighter weaves are known to give       better protection than loosely woven materials, research tests will       emphasize tighter woven fabrics. In addition, physical properties and       resistance to UR. will also be studied for the cellulose produced by four       strains of  Acetobacter.  (NB, AR and NC)            NB will assume the leadership responsibilities       and coordinate the efforts for this part of research.            Thermal       Comfort Studies of Plasma Treated Textiles and Cotton/Microporus Film       Based Nonwovens.            Plasma treated polyester and cotton/polyester       bonded fabric and cotton/microporous film based nonwovens will be tested       for thermal comfort on human subjects. Participants in the study would be       surveyed for potential commercialization of the protective health care       clothing products. (TN, FL and AL)            Wear assessments in a controlled lab setting as       well as using the local medical centers' employees for field-wear       assessments will be performed. In the lab setting, subjects will conduct       an exercise protocol and will be evaluated for changes in heart rate, deep       body temperature, skin temperature, and sweat rate at several intervals       during the test. Results will indicate the comparative potential for       protective garments to induce heat stress. In the field experiment (the        field in this case being the medical facility), subjects will wear the       garments during their normal work routine and will provide subjective       responses related to their comfort during the wear period. User surveys of       hospital personnel to determine components of consumer satisfaction with       currently available medical apparel will also be conducted. (TN, FL, AR       and AL)            FL will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities for thermal comfort studies.            Consumer Acceptance and Market Analysis       of Selected Value-Added Products.            It is also important to gather information from       consumers that show their interest in and willingness to accept consumer       items of kenaf blend and other newer materials/products. Therefore, a       questionnaire (Likert-type scale) used to gather responses will be       designed to help identify concerns or problem areas for consumers. These       findings may be helpful as marketing strategies are developed for       increasing consumer and retailer interest/demand. Findings will also help        identify products with most potential for being commercialized. (MS, AR       and NE)            The acceptance of the newly developed protective       clothing (gloves, aprons, surgical gowns and shoe covers) by health care       professionals through a residency program for family practice physicians       located throughout the state of Arkansas (conditional on fabric meeting       OSHA requirements) will be conducted. A survey of users of current medical       protective clothing fabrics will be conducted to determine usage and       satisfaction. (AR and AL)            An extensive market analysis of the national and       international market potential for sugar cane and kenaf products to impact       the soil erosion control market in the U.S. and abroad will be conducted.       A survey of state transportation departments and federal agencies involved       in highway and other soil erosion sites will be done to determine current       and projected usage of nonwoven and spray-on product. This information       will be used to develop a marketing strategy for sugar cane and kenaf       fiber geotextiles for presentation to sugar cane and kenaf producers and       processors (LA, MS, Southern Louisiana (SLA) and GA)            LA will coordinate the efforts and assume       leadership responsibilities for multi-state surveys which will help       identify products with potential for successful commercialization.            EXPECTED OUTCOMES            The successful production of textile consumer       products from kenaf and sugar cane will enhance the value of these       agricultural crops. Farmers growing kenaf will enjoy added income if there       are superior products that can be marketed. Other benefits will be the       creation of jobs in processing plants and farming, and the use of kenaf in       crop rotation schedules. Similarly, there are numerous nonfood uses of       soybean oils and fatty acids, wheat straw, and modified wheat starch in       textile manufacturing and wet processing that can increase the commercial       importance of these major agricultural commodities while reducing the       consumption of petrochemcials.            Development of sugar cane textiles will enhance       the profitability of cane production and processing by providing a       value-added product from what is currently a waste or by-product. The       support of work at LSU by the American Sugar Cane League has signaled the       interest of the industry in development of such products. The market       analysis to be conducted will greatly facilitate the technology transfer       to industrial processors and hasten the commercialization of these       products.            The nonwoven fabrics of kenaf and/or cotton that       are produced experimentally as part of this project will potentially       expand the market for these agricultural fibers. The collaborative work       proposed herein includes not only the production and characterization of       these fabrics but also extensive studies on biodegradability to examine       the environmental impact. Use of the nonwovens in medical disposable       products has significant environmental benefits for the U.S. In addition       the inclusion of market analysis and consumer acceptance will provide       useful information as this technology is adopted by fabric producers.            The textile auxiliaries being developed at KS and       AL can enhance the properties of current textile products and extend the       uses of agricultural commodities. Softeners and finishes that are       environmentally friendly have both economic and consumer appeal. The       plasma treatment to enhance dyeing and finishing properties is likewise a       significant advance in decreasing the environmental impact of textile       processing.            An important contribution of this project will be       the further development of analytical methodologies for textile       characterization. Methods for determination of barrier properties of       fabrics, measurement of pore size in textile structures, surface analysis,       and determination of formaldehyde release will be developed, used, and       correlated. The new knowledge about pore size, combined with the dyeing       equilibria and kinetics research, will yield critical information for the        development of commercially viable dyeing procedures for kenaf fibers and       fabrics.            Information regarding the ultraviolet radiation       transmission of textiles will be useful in developing more effective sun       protective clothing and in evaluating the influx of UV radiation       protective clothing on the market. Agricultural workers who spend many       hours outdoors will benefit from these developments. A wider range of       sun-protective clothing articles should become available as a result of       this research and increased choices should lead to reduced prices for sun        protective clothing.            In addition to the creation of new value-added       products, this work will contribute to the theoretical body of knowledge       pertaining to the physical and chemical structure of cellulose-based       fibers, polymeric materials and various treatments. It will establish       benchmark information on physical properties, dyeing characteristics,       printing capabilities, and functional end-use performance of various newer       textile products. This information is not currently available and will        make a substantial contribution to the textile literature. In addition to       many publications in research journals, all the findings will be drawn       together in one or many Southern Cooperative Series Bulletins and       Brochures.            ORGANIZATION            A regional technical committee will be organized       upon project approval. Operational procedures to be followed are according       to those outlined on Pages 19-22, and 34-37 of the CSREES  Manual for       Cooperative Regional Research  as revised in October, 1992. The voting       membership of the regional technical committee will include one       representative from each cooperating agricultural experiment station or       institution as appointed by the director and a representative of each       cooperating USDA-ARS research location/unit. The administrative advisor       and the CSREES representative will be considered nonvoting members. All       voting members of the technical committee are considered eligible for       office.            The offices of the regional technical committee       will consist of the chair, the vice-chair, and the secretary. These       officers, along with the administrative advisor and the CSREES       representative, will serve as the executive committee. Officers for the       first year will be elected at the organizational meeting for the technical       committee after the project is approved. After the first year, officers       will be elected annually at the technical committee meeting, and they may        succeed themselves.            The chair, in consultation with the executive       committee, may appoint subcommittees to facilitate the accomplishment of       various research and administrative tasks involving the cooperating       institutional representatives. Such tasks may include, but are not limited       to, research planning and coordination, the development of specific       cooperative research procedures, assimilation and analysis of data from       contributing scientists, and publication of regional or other bulletins        and reports.            The duties of the technical committee are to       coordinate work activities related to the project. The chair, in accord       with the administrative advisor, will notify the technical committee of       the time and place of the meeting and will prepare the agenda and preside       at meetings of the technical committee and executive committee. He or she       is responsible for preparing the annual progress report and coordinating       the preparation of regional reports. The vice-chair assists the chair in       all functions, and the secretary records the minutes and performs other       duties assigned by the technical committee or administrative advisor. The       technical committees will meet annually for the purpose of coordination,       reporting, sharing of procedures and analyses, and conducting project       business.            The executive committee, in consultation with the       technical committee, will make annual assessments of progress to consider       the need for realignment of research effort. In consultation with the       administrative advisor and the CSREES representative, such realignment       will be implemented as appropriate.

Summary:  Mike Cato and Hechmi Hamouda (flC State) are going to attend the 28th Microwave Power Symposium in Montreal Canada July 12-14, 1993. Hechmi will present a paper titled An Analytical Model for the Combined Convective and Radiative (IR) Drying of Fabrics. Following is an abstract from  the paper: The process of moisture removal is analyzed based on a balance of the required and supplied thermal energies during drying. The computations were implemented to investigate the process limitations to achieve efficient fabric dving or preheating. An illustrative example, requiring the removal of 70% of the initial water content from a given fabric, was numerically treated for a specific set of drying conditions.  Hechmi Hamouda and Mike Cato have submitted an abstract to the Microwave and High Frequency 1993 International Conference in Goteborg, Sweden, September 28-30. The title of the abstract is A Precise Model for RF Drying of Yarn Packages. The abstract is given below. A mathematical model of the transport phenomena involved in the radio frequency (RF) drying of yarn packages was developed to describe the simultaneousjlow of heat, liquid, water and air. The model consists of mass and energy balances of the process defined in terms of a set of nonlinear equations; empirical relationships are used to solve these equations. Evaluation and applications of the model was demonstrated through a interactive spreadsheet program. The results of the mathematical model are compared to a set of experimental radio frequency drying tests of yarn packages. These tests were investigated in terms of power, moisture content and dving mechanism.  The computer modeling of polymer properties system consisting of the Biosym software running on a Silicon Graphics workstation has been used to predict properties for several polyesters of interest as binders for xerographic printing of textile substrates. The predictions are being checked by preparing the polyesters and checking properties such as glass transition temperature, melt viscosity and initial shear and tensile moduli. Polyesters are being prepared by interfacial polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride with a number of both single and mixed dials. A number of polymer films have also been prepared by UV initiation of acrylic acid terminated monomers. Polyacrylates, polyesters, and polyurethanes have been prepared and are currently being evaluated. The initial results on the use of an HPLC pumping system with spectroscopic detection for on-line analysis of the dye stream being pumped to a continuous carpet dye range have been completed. Results show that it is possible to dilute the dye stream at least lo-fold with a gradient pumping system with a high degree of precision. A range of dye concentrations from approximately 0.001 g/L to 1 g/L can be analyzed with no dilution of the dye stream and with dilution this range is 0.001 to 1.0 g/L. This is a very conservative estimate of the analytical range. The low volume applicator for continuous dye ranges is functional and initial runs are underway. We are now evaluating the uniformity of wet pick-up and the influence of speed and pressure on the wet pick-up. Based on these experiments, conditions will be selected for uniformity and repeatability studies. Detailed information is also being collected on all existing low volume applicators to look at approaches others have taken to solution of this problem and for comparison with the system we are developing.

A dye is used to impart color to materials of which it becomes an integral part. An aromatic ring structure coupled with a side chain is usually required for resonance and thus to impart color. (Resonance structures that cause displacement or appearance of absorption bands in the visible spectrum of light are responsible for color). Correlation of chemical structure with color has been accomplished in the synthesis of dye using a chromogen-chromophore with auxochrome. Chromogen is the aromatic structure containing benzene, naphthalene, or anthracene rings. A chromophore group is a color giver and is represented by the following radicals, which form a basis for the chemical classification of dyes when coupled with the chromogen: azo (-N=N-); carbonyl (=C=0); carbon (=C=C=); carbon-nitrogen (>C=NH or -CH=N-): nitroso (-NO or N-OH): nitro (-NO 2 or =NO-OH): and sulfur (>C=S, and other carbon-sulfur groups). The chromogen-chromophore structure is often not sufficient to impart solubility and cause adherence of dye to fiber. The auxochrome or bonding affinity groups are amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and sulfonic radicals, or their derivatives. These auxochromes are important in the use classification of dyes. A listing of dyes by use classification comprises the following:       Acetate rayon dyes: developed for cellulose acetate and some synthetic fibers      Acid dyes: used for coloring animal fibers via acidified solution (containing sulfuric acid, acetic acid, sodium sulfate, and surfactants) in combination with amphoteric protein      Azoic dyes: contain the azo group (and formic acid, caustic soda, metallic compounds, and sodium nitrate); especially for application to cotton      Basic dyes: amino derivatives (and acetic acid and softening agents); used mainly for application on paper      Direct dyes: azo dyes, and sodium salts, fixing agents, and metallic (chrome and copper) compounds; used generally on cotton-wool, or cotton-silk combinations      Mordant or chrome dyes: metallic salt or lake formed directly on the fiber by the use of aluminum, chromium, or iron salts that cause precipitation in situ      Lake or pigment dyes: form insoluble compounds with aluminum, barium, or chromium on molybdenum salts; the precipitates are ground to form pigments used in paint and inks      Sulfur or sulfide dyes: contain sulfur or are precipitated from sodium sulfide bath; furnish dull shades with good fastness to light, washing, and acids but susceptible to chlorine and light      Vat dyes: impregnated into fiber under reducing conditions and reoxidized to an insoluble color.     Chemical classification is based on chromogen. For example, nitro dyes have the chromophore -NO2. The Color Index (C.I.), published by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) in cooperation with the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATC), provides a detailed classification of commercial dyes and pigments by generic name and chemical constitution.    Dyes are synthesized in a reactor, filtered,dried, and blended with other additives to produce the final product. The synthesis step involves reactions such as sulfonation, halogenation, amination, diazotization, and coupling, followed by separation processes that may include distillation, precipitation, and crystallization. In general, organic compounds such as naphthalene are reacted with an acid or an alkali along with an intermediate (such as a nitrating or a sulfonating compound) and a solvent to form a dye mixture. The dye is then separated from the mixture and purified. On completion of the manufacture of actual color, finishing operations,including drying, grinding, and standardization, are performed; these are important for maintaining consistent product quality.   Waste Characteristics   The principal air pollutants from dye manufacturing are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen chloride (HCI), and sulfur oxides (SOx).   Liquid effluents resulting from equipment cleaning after batch operation can contain toxic organic residues. Cooling waters are normally recirculated. Wastewater generation rates are of the order of 1-700 liters per kg (1/kg) of product except for vat dyes. The wastewater generation rate for vat dyes can be of the order of 8,000 1/kg of product. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of eactive and azo dyes can be of the order of 25 kg/kg of product and 80 kg/ kg of product, respectively. Values for other dyes are, for example, BOD5, 6 kg/kg; COD, 25 kg/kg; suspending solids, 6 kg/kg; and oil and grease, 30 kg/kg of product.   Major solid wastes of concern include filtration sludges, process and effluent treatment sludges, and container residues. Examples of wastes considered toxic include wastewater treatment sludges, spent acids, and process residues from the manufacture of chrome yellow and orange pigments, molybdate orange pigments, zinc yellow pigments, chrome and chrome oxide green pigments, iron blue pigments, and azo dyes.   Pollution Prevention and Control   Every effort should be made to substitute degradable and less toxic ingredients for highly toxic and persistent ingredients. Recommended pollution prevention measures are to:       Avoid the manufacture of toxic azo dyes and provide alternative dyestuffs to users such as textile manufacturers.      Meter and control the quantities of toxic ingredients to minimize wastage.      Reuse by-products from the process as raw materials or as raw material substitutes in other processes.      Use automated filling to minimize spillage.      Use equipment washdown waters as makeup solutions for subsequent batches.      Return toxic materials packaging to supplier for reuse, where feasible.      Find productive uses for off-specification products to avoid disposal problems.      Use high-pressure hoses for equipment cleaning to reduce the amount of wastewater generated.      Label and store toxic and hazardous materials in secure, bunded areas.     A dye and pigment manufacturing plant should prepare and implement an emergency plan that takes into account neighboring land uses and the potential consequences of an emergency. Measures to avoid the release of harmful substances should be incorporated in the design, operation, maintenance, and management of the plant.   Target Pollution Loads   Implementation of cleaner production processes and pollution prevention measures can yield both economic and environmental benefits.   Specific reduction targets for the different processes have not been determined. In the absence of specific pollution reduction targets, new plants should always achieve better than the industry averages cited in ""Waste Characteristics,"" above .   Treatment Technologies   Air Emissions   Stack gas scrubbing and/or carbon adsorption (for toxic organics) are applicable and effective technologies for minimizing the release of significant pollutants to air. Combustion is used to destroy toxic organics. Combustion devices should be operated at temperatures above 1,100 C (when required for the effective destruction of toxic organics), with a residence time of at least 0.5 second.   Liquid Effluents   Effluent treatment normally includes neutralization, flocculation, coagulation, settling,    carbon adsorption, detoxification of organics by oxidation (using ultraviolet systems or    peroxide solutions), and biological treatment. Exhausted carbon from adsorption processes may be sent for regeneration or combustion. Reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, and other filtration techniques are used to recover and concentrate process intermediates.   Solid Hazardous Wastes   Contaminated solid wastes are generally incinerated, and the flue gases, when acidic, are   scrubbed.   Emissions Guidelines   The guidelines are expressed as concentrations to facilitate monitoring. Dilution of air emissions or effluents to achieve these guidelines is unacceptable.   All of the maximum levels should be achieved for at least 95% of the time that the plant or unit is operating, to be calculated as a proportion of annual operating hours.   Air Emissions   The emissions levels presented in Table I should be achieved.   Table 1.

Ambient Noise   Noise abatement measures should achieve either the levels given below or a maximum increase in background levels of 3 decibels (measured on the A scale) [dB (A)].

Once a record of consistentperformance has been established, sampling for the parameters listed in this document should be   as described below.   Monitoring of air emissions should be done on a continuous basis. Liquid effluents should be    monitored for toxic ingredients at least once every shift. The remaining parameters should be   monitored at least daily.   Monitoring data should be analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the    operating standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken. Records of monitoring results should be kept in an acceptable format. The results should be reported to the responsible authorities and relevant parties, as required   Key Issues   The key production and control practices that will lead to compliance with emissions guidelines can be summarized as follows:       Avoid the manufacture of toxic azo dyes and provide alternative dyestuffs to users such as textile manufacturers.      Replace highly toxic and persistent ingredients with less toxic and degradable ones.      Control loss and wastage of toxic ingredients.      Return packaging for refilling.      Use equipment washdown waters as makeup solutions for subsequent batches.      Minimize wastage by inventory control and find uses for off-specification products.          Source : World Bank"

If spectroscopy     is restricted to the visible spectral range, differences in dye     components may remain undetected. One method of detecting additional     components is to use thin-layer chromatography (TLC). TLC is     an inexpensive, simple, well-documented technique that can be     used, under certain conditions, to complement the use of visible     spectroscopy in comparisons of fiber colorants. The principle     of the method is that the dye components are separated by their     differential migration caused by a mobile phase flowing through     a porous, adsorptive medium.          2.0.

Back to the top          4.0.          Summary of Guidelines        These guidelines are intended     to advise and assist individuals and laboratories that conduct     forensic fiber examinations and comparisons in their effective     application of TLC to the analysis of fiber evidence.        These guidelines are concerned     with the extraction of dyes from single fibers and from bulk     material, classification of the dye or colorant, application     and development of the extractants on TLC plates using an optimal     elution system, and evaluation and interpretation of the resulting     chromatograms. The protocols and equipment mentioned in this     document are not meant to be totally inclusive or exclusive.        Not all fiber type or dye     class combinations are covered in these guidelines.          Back to the top          5.0.          Significance And Use        5.1. Forensic Analysis     of Fiber Colorants Using TLC      Forensic analysis of fiber colorants using TLC should be considered     for single-fiber comparisons only when it is not possible to     discriminate between the fibers of interest using other techniques,     such as comparison microscopy (brightfield and fluorescence)     and microspectrophotometry in the visible range.        5.2. Extraction Procedures     Carried Out Prior to TLC Analysis      The extraction procedures carried out prior to TLC analysis can     provide useful information about dye classification. TLC can     provide useful qualitative information about dye components.     Similar colors made up of different dye components can be differentiated     using this technique. The application of TLC may serve to discriminate     between fibers, or it may confirm their similarity.        5.3. Situations That Preclude     TLC      TLC is not possible in some circumstances: Short lengths of fibers     or pale colored fibers do not have an adequate concentration     of colorant present to be examined, dye extraction from some     fibers is impossible, or desire to preserve evidence for possible     analysis by another examiner precludes removing the color for     analysis.        5.4. Characterizing Dyes     and Evaluating Eluent Systems      Dye from the known material should first be characterized and     eluent systems evaluated to achieve optimum separation of the     extract. Dye is then extracted from single known and questioned     fibers, using an equivalent amount of material.          5.5. Standard          Dye Mixtures Compensate for TLC's Nonreproducibility      TLC is inherently nonreproducible because of variance in eluents     and temperature conditions. Standard dye mixtures (16) should     therefore be used to check eluent performance.        Examples for the preparation     of standard dye mixtures are given in  Appendix     A .          Back to the top          6.0.          Sample Handling        6.1. Using ASTM 1492-94     Standards      The general handling and tracking of the samples should meet     or exceed the requirements of ASTM 1492-94.        6.2. Pretreatment and     Sample Preparation      Pretreatment (e.g., mounting medium and washing solvent) and     sample preparation must be identical for all known and questioned     fibers being compared on one TLC plate. For removing single fibers     from slide preparations, the following procedure is recommended:        6.2.1. Clean the Coverslip.  Any traces of marker pen ink should     be cleaned from the coverslip using an appropriate solvent (e.g.,     acetone);        6.2.2. Crack the Coverslip.  The coverslip should be cracked     all around the fiber, and an appropriate solvent, which will     dissolve the mountant but not affect the fiber or the colorant,     should be used; and        6.2.3. Remove and Clean     the Fiber.  The     fiber should be removed and washed in the solvent.          Back to the top          7.0. Analysis        The ease of dye extraction     and the particular extractant required will depend on the generic     class of the fiber and the type of dye present. The generic class     of the known and questioned fibers must be determined prior to     TLC analysis.        Dye classes are classified     into broad groups on the basis of their chemical properties or     method of application. The determination of the dye class of     the known fibers can be helpful in establishing the best extractant,     as well as to assist in the subsequent selection of the most     efficient eluent system.        Documented extraction schemes     (see  Appendix B ) can be used to determine     the dye class of fibers of known generic classes and, thus, the     optimum extractant. Dye classification is performed on single     fibers or tufts of fiber removed from the known item. A new fiber     or tuft can be used for each classification stage.          7.1. Dye Extraction          Known and questioned fibers must be extracted at the same time under the          same conditions. Single fibers can be extracted in a short length (about          25 mm) of fine capillary tube (internal diameter of about 1.5 mm) that          is sealed at one end. A fine wire can be useful in pushing the fiber down          the tube. The tube must be appropriately labeled.        About 10 µL of the     appropriate extractant (as recommended in  Appendix     C  and  Appendix D ) should be introduced     into the tube to cover the fiber sample. A fine glass pipette     or syringe can be used for this. The tube should be heat sealed     to avoid evaporation and incubated for a constant time and temperature     (as recommended in Appendix B), preferably in an oven. Periodic     checks for dye extraction should be made every 15 minutes for     up to 1 hour.        7.2. Dye Extraction for     Bulk Material      Larger fiber tufts (e.g., known samples) can be extracted in     a Durham tube or other suitable small stoppered glass tube, using     about 100 µL of solvent in a sand bath or oven heated to     100°C. Periodic checks should be made every 15 minutes for     up to 1 hour.        7.3. Nonextractable Dyes      If classification indicates that a nonextractable dye or pigment     other than a reactive dye is present, then place one known and     one questioned fiber in labeled capillary tubes. Add approximately     10 µL pyridine/water (4:3) and attempt to extract at about     100°C for one hour. If neither fiber extracts, a positive     association is noted. If the questioned extracts and the known     does not (or vice versa), it is negative. If both questioned     and known bleed dye into solution, there can be sufficient dye     for analysis.        7.4. Elution      Aluminum-backed silica gel 60F 254 plates measuring 5 cm ×     7.5 cm are recommended for normal-phase TLC of fiber dyes (16).     Plates should be stored in a desiccator. If this is not possible,     they should be heat activated before use.        Both known and questioned     dyes to be compared must be applied to the same plate. The extract     should be spotted onto the plate about 1 cm from the lower edge.     This can be done using a double-drawn capillary tube or other     suitable device. Spots should not be too near the edge of the     plate or to each other. Care should be taken to avoid scratching     the adsorbent coating layer.        Spots should be dried using     a hair dryer or hot plate, and repeated applications should be     made until the spot is strongly colored. The spot size should     be uniform and not exceed about 2 mm in size.        At least two (preferably     more) known spots should be included on each plate, on both sides     of the questioned sample or samples. It is advisable to include     a standard dye spot. A note must be made of the sample order     on the plate itself. Plates must be thoroughly dried before developing.        7.5. Development Chamber      Chromatograms can be developed vertically in a glass chamber,     which can be as simple as a covered glass beaker. Commercial     tanks are available (16). Twin trough tanks allow the solvent     to be transferred to the plate side without removing the cover,     but extreme care must be taken when doing this.        The eluent should be added     to the tank and allowed to stand in the closed container for     a few minutes before development, which allows the chamber to     be saturated with the solvent vapor. (This will not be complete     if a beaker is used, but equilibration is not critical when sample     size is very small and the elution time is short.)        The level of the eluent in     a vertical tank should be at least 0.5 cm below the origin or     application spots on the TLC plate. The plate should be eluted     until good resolution is achieved (normally 2 cm from the origin)     but not so far as to allow the spots to become diffuse, which     makes visualization difficult. The plate should be removed, and     the position of the solvent front marked. The plate should be     dried in a hot air stream. The eluent should be discarded.        7.5.1. Selecting the     Eluent.  Five     parameters must be considered when selecting the optimum eluent:      7.5.1.1. Separation of component dyes;      7.5.1.2. Sharpness of bands;      7.5.1.3. Movement from the origin;      7.5.1.4. Components traveling at or close to solvent front; and      7.5.1.5. Strength of dye extract from questioned fibers.        There are numerous published     TLC solvent systems that can be applied to the development of     particular fiber and dye class combinations (see Appendixes C     and D).        Two or more systems should     be assessed with the known fibers to determine the optimum eluent     system that can be used for comparison with the questioned fibers.        Equivalent lengths of fiber     should be used for pale fibers or short sample lengths. The extract     from known material should be applied to the TLC plate and developed     in the trial eluents as previously described.        If the eluents produce poor     separation, other eluents appropriate to the dye class are evaluated.     In exceptional circumstances, eluents appropriate to other dye     classes can be used.        After a suitable eluent system     has been found, comparison of known and questioned fibers can     be carried out. Co-chromatography can be carried out for bulk     samples.        After drying, plates should     be examined immediately in visible and in longwave ultraviolet     light. Band positions and colors should be noted.        The color and fluorescence     of the spots and the distance from the center of each spot to     the origin can be measured and recorded. The method of documentation     is a matter of individual laboratory preference.        Plates and samples must be     identifiable. Plates must be either documented by photography     or retained and stored out of direct sunlight in a manner designed     to minimize fading or both.          Back to the top          8.0.          Report Documentation        Chromatograms of dyes from     the same fibers run in different eluent systems or on different     plate types are considered mutually exclusive. The spot colors,     fluorescence, sequence, and position of the spots obtained from     the dye of the questioned fibers are compared to those from the     corresponding known fibers.        A positive association occurs     when the band colors, fluorescence, sequence, and positions are     consistent between questioned and known fibers. A negative (exclusion)     association is noted when either the questioned or known patterns     show no similarities, or where there are a number of coincident     bands, but one or more bands are missing from the questioned     or known. An inconclusive association is noted when there are     no bands on the TLC plate because insufficient colorant is present     in the extract. In cases where the amount of extract is very     small, the distance traveled by the eluent is very small, and     in some cases the spots may not be well-defined. In these circumstances,     attempts to calculate the Retardation Factor (RF) values can     easily be inaccurate and therefore meaningless.        The TLC methods applied to     the forensic comparison of fiber colorants must have been published     in a recognized forensic journal, forensically relevant textbook,     or in an accredited forensic laboratory manual.        Plates must be identifiable     with respect to case number, sample source, examiner, and date.     Case documentation on TLC must include the source of the samples;     method of dye classification; details of extractants or eluent     systems tested, used, or both; and the results. The use of standard     dye mixtures as system performance checks is strongly recommended.          Back to the top          9.0. References        (1) Fried, B. and Sherma,     J.

In the meantime, we have synthesized an analog of these dyes that possesses improved water solubility, and will be evaluating its fastness properties soon. In recent weeks, we elected to turn our attention to a family of less commonly used complex-forming monoazo dyes as targets for the synthesis of new I:2 Iron complexes. The result has been the formation of blue and violet colors for nylon and wool, in addition to brown and black shades. Needless to say, this is an exciting and quite promising turn of events. We are planning to synthesize a group of mixed complexes, with the goal of fine tuning some of the present shades. Obviously, the next step is to assess the fastness properties of this new family of dyes. The results of this determination will be outlined in our next report. Preliminary results from the mutagenicity testing of the metallized dyes prepared so far indicate that the Fe complexes are either non-mutagenic or significantly less mutagenic than both the corresponding Co and Cr analogs and the unmetallized precursors. Laura will have more definitive results for the next report.

Summary:  We completed our investigation of the utility of FeCl, as a coagulant for the removal of phosphate ions from disperse dye wastewater. Using filtrates derived from the synthesis of Disperse Red 177, we found that phosphate removal at a level of 99.999+% can be achieved when an Fe:P ratio of 2: 1 is used. This means that either Alum or FeCl, can be used as long as the proper pH is employed. For Alum the pH should be 5-6, and for the pH should be 3-4. In the coming months we will conclude the present aspect of our work in this area with a determination of the utility of the collected phosphate as a component for commercial fertilizers. This is envisioned as an alternative to either incineration or landfilling the coagulants. Technical Papers and Other Communications  A manuscript entitled ""Premetallized Acid Dyes Based on Environmental Considerations"" has been prepared for the Book of Papers for the upcoming AATCC International Conference (October, 1993). This paper outlines the results to be presented during the conference delivery, and focuses on the fastness properties and genotoxicity of the black Fe complexes synthesized as potential non-chromium alternatives to commercial premetallized acid black dyes containing Cr. The manuscript mentioned in our last report as having been submitted to Textile Research Journal has been reviewed, and was found acceptable pending our consideration of 3 points. These were handled by us immediately, and the editor has sent the revised manuscript to the reviewer for final consideration.  Joint research involving all three universities is being done to determine the effects of washing efficiency on dielectric properties and RF drying of yarn packages. Warren Perkins has determined common residuals in bleached and dyed yarn packages. With Warren's recommendations, experiments are being designed and conducted at Georgia Tech using a network analyzer which measures the dielectric properties of materials. Different solutions typically found in textile dyeing have been prepared and analyzed to determine their dielectric properties. Different types of salt had significantly different loss factors. Data is being analyzed and a final report will be compiled within two months. NC State is planning to use the information learned at Georgia Tech to design pilot plant drying studies. To better understand the network analyzer, Mike Cato, from NC State, worked at Georgia Tech for a day.  National Textib Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993  23   the tests.

Summary:  Mike Cato and Hechmi Hamouda (flC State) are going to attend the 28th Microwave Power Symposium in Montreal Canada July 12-14, 1993. Hechmi will present a paper titled An Analytical Model for the Combined Convective and Radiative (IR) Drying of Fabrics. Following is an abstract from  the paper: The process of moisture removal is analyzed based on a balance of the required and supplied thermal energies during drying. The computations were implemented to investigate the process limitations to achieve efficient fabric dving or preheating. An illustrative example, requiring the removal of 70% of the initial water content from a given fabric, was numerically treated for a specific set of drying conditions.  Hechmi Hamouda and Mike Cato have submitted an abstract to the Microwave and High Frequency 1993 International Conference in Goteborg, Sweden, September 28-30. The title of the abstract is A Precise Model for RF Drying of Yarn Packages. The abstract is given below. A mathematical model of the transport phenomena involved in the radio frequency (RF) drying of yarn packages was developed to describe the simultaneousjlow of heat, liquid, water and air. The model consists of mass and energy balances of the process defined in terms of a set of nonlinear equations; empirical relationships are used to solve these equations. Evaluation and applications of the model was demonstrated through a interactive spreadsheet program. The results of the mathematical model are compared to a set of experimental radio frequency drying tests of yarn packages. These tests were investigated in terms of power, moisture content and dving mechanism.  The computer modeling of polymer properties system consisting of the Biosym software running on a Silicon Graphics workstation has been used to predict properties for several polyesters of interest as binders for xerographic printing of textile substrates. The predictions are being checked by preparing the polyesters and checking properties such as glass transition temperature, melt viscosity and initial shear and tensile moduli. Polyesters are being prepared by interfacial polymerization of terephthaloyl chloride with a number of both single and mixed dials. A number of polymer films have also been prepared by UV initiation of acrylic acid terminated monomers. Polyacrylates, polyesters, and polyurethanes have been prepared and are currently being evaluated. The initial results on the use of an HPLC pumping system with spectroscopic detection for on-line analysis of the dye stream being pumped to a continuous carpet dye range have been completed. Results show that it is possible to dilute the dye stream at least lo-fold with a gradient pumping system with a high degree of precision. A range of dye concentrations from approximately 0.001 g/L to 1 g/L can be analyzed with no dilution of the dye stream and with dilution this range is 0.001 to 1.0 g/L. This is a very conservative estimate of the analytical range. The low volume applicator for continuous dye ranges is functional and initial runs are underway. We are now evaluating the uniformity of wet pick-up and the influence of speed and pressure on the wet pick-up. Based on these experiments, conditions will be selected for uniformity and repeatability studies. Detailed information is also being collected on all existing low volume applicators to look at approaches others have taken to solution of this problem and for comparison with the system we are developing. A trip is planned next quarter to visit the Research Center in Valence, France. is one of the leading companies in printing technology and we are interested in one of the Imaje units as a test bed for our materials development effort.

GX002-59-4119626	"Nuclear Energy   (An Overview)    Also See Our Nuclear Issues Web Page     Nuclear energy in California produced  40,417 million kilowatt/hours (GWh) of electricity in 1999, or 14.66 percent of electricity from all sources.  The total dependable capacity of California's nuclear-supplied power is more than 5,300 megawatts, including the two operating   nuclear power facilities in California  and portions of nuclear facilities in other states owned by California electricity companies.   There are two fundamental ways to release energy from nuclear reactions:  fission  and   fusion  of atomic nuclei. Electricity generating technologies based on fission are commercially available, whereas fusion is still in the early stages of research and development and is at present only a theoretical possibility for controlled power generation.  Nuclear fission is the process of splitting the nuclei of atoms, which releases energy from within those atoms.  Nuclear fusion is the process of joining, rather than splitting, such atomic particles with similar releases of energy.         FISSION   Of the several types of fission reactors, the most common type in the United States is light water reactors (so called because normal (light) water is used to cool the reactor core; some reactors use heavy water, which contains hydrogen atoms with an additional neutron in the nucleus), based on pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) technology.  PWRs and BWRs use uranium-235, a naturally-occurring radioactive isotope of uranium, as the fuel.  As the nucleus of a uranium-235 atom is hit by a neutron, it splits into two smaller atoms of other elements, and releases energy and extra neutrons.  Those neutrons hit more atoms of the original uranium-235, creating a fission chain reaction that releases more energy and neutrons.   In a PWR, water passes through the nuclear core and is heated. The power plant's primary circulating system passes water through the reactor core, where the water is heated by the nuclear reaction.  That water (under high temperature and pressure to prevent boiling) is passed through a steam generator, where it releases its heat to the secondary circulating system.  Water in the secondary circulating system is allowed to boil, and the resulting steam is used to drive a steam turbine-generator.   In a BWR, there is no need for a steam generator and a secondary circulating system, as the water in the primary circulating system is allowed to boil before exiting the reactor and is then routed directly to a steam turbine-generator.         Safety Issues   In light of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., many have raised concerns about the safety of nuclear facilities in the event of an attack by crashing a commercial jet liner.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been asked what would happen if a fully fueled airliner crashed into a nuclear power plant.  NRC officials said, ""Although nuclear power plants are not explicitly designed for the crash of a commercial aircraft, plants have inherent capability to provide for the protection of public health and safety. Pre-stressed concrete containment buildings are robust, and it is unlikely a large commercial plane could penetrate the containment structure. Furthermore, plant designs and redundant safety equipment along with highly trained operators are in place to limit the potential consequences.""   Pacific Gas and Electric Company was asked the same question, and they reportedly said that their Diablo Canyon Nuclear Plant is designed to withstand the impact of a fully loaded ""747"" aircraft.

Other Types of Fission Plants    There are several advanced reactor power plant designs being developed in the U.S. and over-seas.  These include both advanced light water reactor (ALWR) and advanced modular reactor designs.  The ALWR program is focusing on both evolutionary and passive designs, using both BWR and PWR technologies.  Each design configuration is seeking certification by the U.S. NRC as a standard design under the U.S. Department of Energy's ALWR Design Certification Program.    The evolutionary ALWRs are advancements of today's light water reactor designs and use conventional safety system concepts.  There are two evolutionary ALWR designs that are expected to be ready for commercial operation by the year 2000: the 1,356 MW Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and the 1,350 MW Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (System 80+).  Two ABWR units are being built in Japan.   As of July 1996, the first unit is ready to begin commercial operation.  The second unit is scheduled to begin operation in 1997.  In June 1996, Taiwan ordered two ABWR units.  The System 80+ PWR received its final design approval from the NRC in July 1994.   The passive ALWR designs are greatly simplified and employ primarily passive means for accident prevention and mitigation. There are two passive ALWR designs that have been considered: 600 MW Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (AP600) and the 600 MW Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR).  The AP600 Advanced PWR is expected to receive its final design approval from the NRC in September 1996.  It could be ready for commercial operation by the year 2003.  The future of the SBWR is uncertain at this time.   The Advanced Modular Reactor Program is focusing on the development of small (165 MW to 217 MW) reactors that can be grouped together as modules of a larger power station.  The two advanced modular reactor designs, which are also seeking design certification, are the 1,500 MW Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor (ALMR) and the 700 MW Modular High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (MHTGR).  These designs are expected to be ready for commercial operation by the year 2010.      Issues for Fission Power Plants   Some of the issues associated with commercial nuclear power plants include:      Nuclear plants may not be economically feasible in the United States. No American utility has proposed to construct a new nuclear power plant since the late 1970s.    Need for a spent fuel disposal facility and a decommissioning plan    Use of large amounts of water for cooling purposes (if wet cooling towers are used)    Biological impacts on the ocean due to thermal discharge (if seawater cooling is used)    Designing for seismic safety    Public safety concerns    Transportation issues associated with the development of an emergency evacuation plan    Changes in visual quality due to the power plant structures, including the reactor vessel containment structure, and cooling towers (if applicable)    Potentially significant amounts of land    Potentially significant public opposition           FUSION   A fusion reaction occurs when nuclei of light elements, specifically hydrogen and its isotopes (deuterium, or ""heavy water,"" and tritium), are forced together at extremely high temperatures and densities until they fuse into nuclei of heavier elements and release enormous amounts of energy.  If fusion is to yield net energy, the fuel must be heated in the form of plasma (a highly ionized gas) to a very high temperature and the plasma must then be held together for a sufficiently long time such that the number of fusion reactions occurring releases more energy than was required to heat the fuel.     The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory's Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) in 1996 demonstrated fusion of deuterium-tritium plasma at 510 million degrees Celsius.  That experiment produced heating equal to one-third of that needed for the fusion reaction to become self-sustaining.  Thus, there is still significant research that must be accomplished before fusion achieves a net energy output, and then even more development work to develop commercial power plant applications.  It is estimated that commercial availability of fusion is at least 20 years away.    To generate commercial energy, the neutron energy would be converted to heat in a surrounding blanket of coolant, probably containing solid lithium compounds, with the heat converted to electricity in a conventional steam generator cycle.  Although the fusion reaction does not produce radioactive fission products, the high energy neutrons do irradiate the surrounding reactor vessel and associated components.  The irradiated material poses radioactive disposal problems similar to those for the irradiated reactor vessels of fission reactors.  Thus, many of the high-level nuclear waste concerns that apply to fission reactors would also apply to fusion reactors.   The term ""cold fusion,"" as reported in the popular press in recent years, refers to the process of fusing hydrogen nuclei at room temperature.  It was allegedly demonstrated in a simple laboratory apparatus in 1989 by Fleischman and Pons.  Several experiments have been conducted to try to replicate their work, with limited success.  The phenomenon of cold fusion cannot be reproduced on demand and cannot be explained by conventional nuclear physics.  Therefore, its commercial potential as an electric generating technology is uncertain.   An excellent article on cold fusion recently appeared in  Issue 6.11 of  Wired Magazine .

According to President Clinton, the Green Chemistry Challenge was established to ""promote pollution prevention and industrial ecology through a new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Design for the Environment partnership with the chemical industry."" More specifically, the program was established to recognize and support fundamental and innovative chemical methodologies that are useful to industry and that accomplish pollution prevention through source reduction. EPA Administrator Carol Browner announced the Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program on October 30, 1995. She described the program as an opportunity for individuals, groups, and organizations ""to compete for Presidential awards in recognition of fundamental breakthroughs in cleaner, cheaper, smarter chemistry."" The Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program provides national recognition for technologies that incorporate green chemistry principles into chemical design, manufacture, and use. Entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards were judged by an independent panel of technical experts convened by the American Chemical Society. The criteria for judging included health and environmental benefits, scientific innovation, and industrial applicability. Five projects that best met the scope of the program and the criteria for judging were selected for 1997 awards and nationally recognized on June 24, 1997. This document provides summaries of the entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. The approaches described in these summaries illustrate how numerous individuals, groups, and organizations from academia, small businesses, industry, and government are demonstrating a commitment to designing, developing, and implementing green chemical methodologies that are less hazardous to human health and the environment. The approaches described in these summaries also illustrate the technical and economic feasibility of implementing green chemical methodologies and are recognized for their beneficial scientific, economic, and environmental impacts.  Note: The summaries provided in this document were obtained from the entries received for the 1997 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards. They were edited for space, stylistic consistency, and clarity, but they were not written by nor are officially endorsed by EPA. In many cases, these summaries represent only a fraction of the information provided in the entries received and, as such, are intended to highlight the nominated projects, not describe them fully.

Commercialized since 1992 in BHC's 3,500 metric-ton-per-year facility in Bishop, Texas, the new process was cited as an industry model of environmental excellence in chemical processing technology. For its innovation, BHC was the recipient of the Kirkpatrick Achievement Award for ""outstanding advances in chemical engineering technology"" in 1993. The new technology involves only three catalytic steps, with approximately 80 percent atom utilization (virtually 99 percent including the recovered byproduct acetic acid) and replaces technology with 6 stoichiometric steps and less than 40 percent atom utilization. The use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride as both a catalyst and solvent offers important advantages in reaction selectivity and waste reduction. As such, this chemistry is a model of source reduction, the method of waste minimization that tops EPA's waste management hierarchy. Virtually all starting materials are either converted to product or reclaimed byproduct, or are completely recovered and recycled in the process. The generation of waste is practically eliminated. The BHC ibuprofen process is an innovative, efficient technology that revolutionized bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing. The process provides an elegant solution to a prevalent problem encountered in bulk pharmaceutical synthesis (i.e., how to avoid the large quantities of solvents and wastes associated with the traditional stoichiometric use of auxiliary chemicals when effecting chemical conversions). Large volumes of aqueous wastes (salts) normally associated with such manufacturing are virtually eliminated. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride catalyst/solvent is recovered and recycled with greater than 99.9 percent efficiency. No other solvent is needed in the process, simplifying product recovery and minimizing fugitive emissions. The nearly complete atom utilization of this streamlined process truly makes it a waste-minimizing, environmentally friendly technology.  2   Alternative Solvents/Reaction Conditions Award DryViewTM Imaging Systems Photothermography is an imaging technology whereby a latent image, created by exposing a sensitized emulsion to appropriate light energy, is processed by the application of thermal energy. Photothermographic films are easily imaged by laser diode imaging systems, with the resultant exposed film processed by passing it over a heat roll. A heat roll operating at 250 F in contact with the film will produce diagnostic-quality images in approximately 15 seconds. Based on photothermography technology, Imation's DryViewTM Imaging Systems use no wet chemistry, create no effluent, and require no additional postprocess steps such as drying. In contrast, silver halide photographic films are processed by bathing them in a chemical developer, soaking them in a fix solution, washing them with clean water, and finally drying them. The developer and fix solutions contain toxic chemicals such as hydroquinone, silver, and acetic acid. In the wash cycle, this chemistry, along with silver compounds, is flushed from the film and becomes part of the waste stream. The resulting effluent amounts to billions of gallons of liquid waste each year. Significant developments in photothermographic image quality have been achieved that allow it to successfully compete with silver halide technology. During 1996, Imation placed more than 1,500 DryViewTM medical laser imagers, which represent 6 percent of the world's installed base. These units alone have eliminated the annual disposal of 192,000 gallons of developer, 330,000 gallons of fixer, and 54.5 million gallons of contaminated water into the waste stream. As future systems are placed, the reductions will be even more dramatic. DryViewTM technology is applicable to all industries that process panchromatic film products. The largest of these industries are medical radiography, printing, industrial radiography, and military reconnaissance. DryViewTM is valued by these industries because it supports pollution prevention through source reduction.  Imation  3   Designing Safer Chemicals Award Albright & Wilson Americas  THPS Biocides: A New Class of Antimicrobial Chemistry Conventional biocides, used to control the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi in industrial cooling systems, oil fields, and process applications, are highly toxic to humans and aquatic life and often persist in the environment, leading to long-term damage. To address this problem, a new and relatively benign biocide, tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium sulfate (THPS), has been discovered by Albright & Wilson Americas. THPS biocides represent a completely new class of antimicrobial chemistry that combines superior antimicrobial activity with a relatively benign toxicology profile. THPS's benefits include low toxicity, low recommended treatment level, rapid breakdown in the environment, and no bioaccumulation. When substituted for more toxic biocides, THPS biocides provide reduced risks to both human health and the environment. THPS is so effective as a biocide that, in most cases, the recommended treatment level is below that which would be toxic to fish. In addition, THPS rapidly breaks down in the environment through hydrolysis, oxidation, photodegradation, and biodegradation. In many cases, it substantially breaks down before the treated water enters the environment. The degradation products have been shown to possess a relatively benign toxicology profile. Furthermore, THPS does not bioaccumulate and, therefore, offers a much reduced risk to higher life forms. THPS biocides are aqueous solutions and do not contain volatile organic compounds. Because THPS is halogen-free, it does not contribute to dioxin or AOX formation. Because of its low overall toxicity and easier handling when compared to alternative products, THPS provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of health and safety incidents. THPS has been applied to a range of industrial water systems for the successful control of microorganisms. The U.S. industrial water treatment market for nonoxidizing biocides alone is 42 million pounds per year and growing at 6 to 8 percent annually. There are over 500,000 individual use sites in this industry category. Because of its excellent environmental profile, THPS has already been approved for use in environmentally sensitive areas around the world and is being used as a replacement for the higher risk alternatives.  4   Small Business Award ColdstripTM, A Revolutionary Organic Removal and Wet Cleaning Technolog y For over 30 years, the removal of photoresists with Piranha solutions (sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, or ashers) has been the standard in the semiconductor, flat panel display, and micromachining industries. Use of Piranha solutions has been associated with atmospheric, ground, and water pollution. Legacy Systems, Inc. (LSI) has developed a revolutionary wet processing technology, ColdstripTM, that removes photoresist and organic contaminants for the semiconductor, flat panel display, and micromachining industries. ColdstripTM uses only water and oxygen as raw materials. LSI's ColdstripTM process is a chilled ozone process that uses only oxygen and water as the raw materials. The active product is ozone, that safely decomposes to oxygen in the presence of photoresist. Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxygen, and water are formed. There are no high temperatures, no sulfuric acid, no hydrogen peroxide, and no nitric acid, all of which cause environmental issues. The equipment required for the chilled ozone process consists of a gas diffuser, an ozone generator, a recirculating pump, a water chiller, and a process vessel. The water solution remains clear and colorless throughout the entire process sequence. There are no particles or resist flakes shed from the wafer into the water; therefore, there are no requirements for particle filtration. Using oxygen and water as raw materials replacing the Piranha solutions significantly benefits the environment. One benefit is the elimination of over 8,400 gallons of Piranha solutions used per year per silicon wet station and over 25,200 gallons used per year per flat panel display station. Additionally, the overall water consumption is reduced by over 3,355,800 gallons per year per silicon wafer wet station and over 5,033,700 gallons per year per flat panel display station. The corresponding water consumption in LSI's process is 4,200 gallons per year and there is no Piranha use. In 1995, the U.S. Patent Office granted LSI patent 5,464,480 covering this technology. The system has the lowest environmental impact of any wet resist strip process, eliminating the need for thousands of gallons of Piranha chemicals and millions of gallons of water a year.  Legacy Systems, Inc.  5   Academic Award Professor Joseph M. DeSimone, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University  Design and Application of Surfactants for Carbon Dioxide One dilemma of modern industrial technology is that the environment's worst contaminants themselves have a technologies for the design and application of surfactants oped at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill dilemma. the solvents required to dissolve contaminating effect. Now, new for carbon dioxide (CO2), devel(UNC), promise to resolve this  Over 30 billion pounds of organic and halogenated solvents are used worldwide each year as solvents, processing aids, cleaning agents, and dispersants. Solvent-intensive industries are considering alternatives that can reduce or eliminate the negative impact that solvent emissions can have in the workplace and in the environment. CO2, in a solution state, has long been recognized as an ideal solvent, extractant, and separation aid. CO2 solutions are nontoxic, nonflammable, safe to work with, energy-efficient, cost-effective, waste-minimizing, and reusable. Historically, the prime factor inhibiting the use of this solvent replacement has been the low solubility of most materials in CO2, both in its liquid and supercritical (sc) states. With the discovery of CO2 surfactant systems, Professor DeSimone and his students have dramatically advanced the solubility performance characteristics of CO2 systems for several industries. The design of broadly applicable surfactants for CO2 relies on the identification of `CO2-philic' materials from which to build amphiphiles. Although CO2 in both its liquid and supercritical states dissolves many small molecules readily, it is a very poor solvent at easily accessible conditions (e.g., T less than 100 C and P less than 300 bar) for many substances. As an offshoot of Professor DeSimone's research program on polymer synthesis in CO2, he and his researchers exploited the high solubility of a select few CO2-philic polymeric segments to develop nonionic surfactants capable of dispersing high solids polymer latexes in both liquid and sc CO2 phases. The design criteria they developed for surfactants, which were capable of stabilizing heterogeneous polymerizations in CO2, have been expanded to include CO2-insoluble compounds in general. This development lays the foundation by which surfactant-modified CO2 can be used to replace conventional (halogenated) organic solvent systems currently used in manufacturing and service industries such as precision cleaning, medical device fabrication, and garment care as well as in the chemical manufacturing and coating industries.  6   Entries From Academia Biocatalysis/The Use of Genetically Manipulated Microbes as Synthetic Catalysts Fundamentally changing chemical syntheses, as opposed to incremental changes in currently practiced syntheses, is one strategy for ensuring that environmental improvement does not occur at the expense of global, economic competitiveness. Examples of this design principle are found in the syntheses of adipic acid and catechol created by John W. Frost and Karen M. Draths as well as in this research team's elaboration of the antioxidant activity of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). In excess of 1.9 x 109 kg of adipic acid is annually produced and used in the manufacture of nylon 66. Most commercial syntheses of adipic acid use benzene as the starting material. Approximately 2.1 x 107 kg of catechol is globally produced each year. Catechol is an important chemical building block used to synthesize flavors, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymerization inhibitors and antioxidants. Although some catechol is distilled from coal tar, petroleum-derived benzene is the starting material for most catechol production. The Frost-Draths syntheses of adipic acid and catechol rely on the use of genetically manipulated microbes as synthetic catalysts. Nontoxic glucose is employed as a starting material that, in turn, is derived from renewable feedstocks such as plant starch. In addition, water is used as the primary reaction solvent, and generation of toxic intermediates and environment-damaging byproducts is avoided. Professor W. John Frost, Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University Professor Karen M. Draths, Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University  Biomimetic Transition Metal Complexes for Homogeneous Catalytic Reductive Dechlorination of the PCBs/One-Step Extraction-Detoxification in Subcritical and Supercritical Fluids Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous in the global environment, toxic, and generally nonbiodegradable. A family of homogeneous catalysts has been developed at the University of Georgia for the conversion of PCBs to dechlorinated congeners and nontoxic biphenyl by a hydrogenolysis process known as reductive dechlorination (RD). This unique green chemistry has been demonstrated to occur at room temperature due to the high reactivity of the homogeneous transition metal catalysts used for activation of the carbon chlorine bond. The organophosphorus transition metal complexes used for catalysis also are extractable in subcritical solvents used for PCB extraction from soils, sediments, and animal and human tissue matrices. Hence, coextraction of PCBs and the transition metal catalyst has been demonstrated, leading to dechlorination and detoxification of the PCB mixture in one step. This process is compatible with chemical engineering unit operations for countercurrent continuous liquid extraction, as practiced in the chemical industry.  Dr. Charles M. King, Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia Dr. R. Bruce King, Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia  7   Professor Richard A. Gross, Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts-- Lowell Dr. David L. Kaplan, Department of Chemical Engineering, Tufts University  Biotechnological Routes to ` Tailored' Polymeric Products of Environmental and Industrial Importance Microbial polymerizations offer the potential for the discovery of important new routes to polymers and materials from renewable resources that involve all aqueous, green chemical routes. A critical problem limiting the utility of such methods is the inability to control product structural variables that ultimately determine functional properties. The work of Richard A. Gross has led to the development of a family of technologies that demonstrated unprecedented levels of control for nonribosomal mediated microbial polymerizations. Lipoheteropolysaccharides have been prepared from renewable resources, and innovative methods were developed to control the product's fatty acid structure and the degree of substitution. This has led to a diverse family of new biodegradable bioemulsifiers that have wide applicability for the stabilization of oil/water emulsions in cleaning and degreasing formulations, biocosmetics, green coating technologies, and bioremediation of organic pollutants. A second technology area has used polyethylene glycols to regulate microbial polyester molecular weight, repeat unit composition, and alter repeat unit sequence distribution. Furthermore, this strategy can be used to form microbial polyester-polyethylene glycol diblock copolymers. It is now possible, therefore, to consider the in-vivo preparation of synthetic-natural diblocks. This technology created a number of opportunities for the preparation of completely biodegradable interfacial agents for blends, the termination of chains with reactive end-groups for coupling pharmacologically active molecules, and the engineering of surfactant molecules. A third technology area has been the development of new fermentation routes to anionic -poly(glutamic acid) from renewable resources such as glucose. These routes have the potential to replace millions of pounds of anionic polymers, such as polyacrylic acid, which is nonbiodegradable and persistent in nature.  Professor Alan T. Hatton, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Stephen L. Buchwald, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Linda K. Molnar, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Derivatized and Polymeric Solvents for Minimizing Pollution During the Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals A new class of solvents has been developed that has solvation properties similar to those of solvents used conventionally in chemical synthesis, separations, and cleaning operations, but for which the potential for loss by environmentally unfavorable air emissions or aqueous discharge streams is minimized. These alternative solvents are derivatives of solvents currently used in reaction and separation processes, tailored so that they are relatively nonvolatile and nonwater soluble, thereby satisfying the criteria for pollution source reduction. The solvents can be used as neat reaction or separation media, or they can be diluted in an inert environment such as in higher alkanes. Polymeric or oligomeric solvents have been synthesized using macromonomers incorporating the desired solvent functionality. These polymeric solvents are easily recovered using mechanical separations such as ultrafiltration rather than energy-intensive distillation processes. This new concept for the design and synthesis of solvents offers the potential for significant source reductions in air and water pollution and can be considered to be widely applicable to fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis, separations, and cleaning operations. It is expected to reduce the complexity of downstream processing options considerably and lead to energy efficient reaction/separation sequences.  8   Environmental Advantages Offered by Indium-Promoted Carbon-Carbon Bond-Forming Reactions in Water In view of increasing demands to reduce emissions during the production of chemical and pharmaceutical end-products, it is imperative to consider the development of effective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in aqueous media. The work of Dr. Paquette demonstrates not only that the counter-intuitive notion of organometallic carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions performed in water is indeed workable but also that high levels of stereocontrol are attainable. The key to this safe, environmentally friendly technology is the utilization of metallic indium as the promoter. The metal indium, a relatively unexplored element, has recently been shown to offer intriguing advantages for promoting organic transformations in aqueous solution. The feasibility of performing organometallic/carbonyl condensations in water, for example, has been amply demonstrated for the metal indium. Indium is nontoxic, very resistant to air oxidation, and easily recovered by simple electrochemical means, thus permitting its reuse and guaranteeing uncontaminated waste flow. The power of the synthetic method, which often can exceed performance levels observed in purely organic solvents, includes no need for protecting groups, greatly enhanced ease of operation, and greatly reduced pollution risks.  Dr. Leo A. Paquette, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University  Environmentally Benign Approach to Chemical Processing Using Microwave Irradiation Under SolventFree Conditions An environmentally benign approach was developed by Rajender S. Varma that utilizes microwave activation of neat reactants either in the presence of a catalyst or catalyzed by the surfaces of recyclable support(s) such as alumina, silica, clay, and `doped' surfaces, namely, NaIO4-silica, iron(III)nitrate-clay (clayfen) and Envirocats reagents under solvent-free `dry' conditions, thus promoting `at source' reduction of solvents and excess chemicals in manufacture. This pollution prevention strategy has been targeted to industrially significant cleavage, condensation, oxidation, and cyclisation reactions that currently employ toxic, corrosive, and irritant chemicals, and generate hazardous waste. This technology uses material science, molecular modeling and synthetic organic chemistry expertise, and addresses the needs of the broad chemical community (e.g., polymer, pharmaceutical, and fine chemical) by efficient production of valuable intermediates (e.g., enones, imines, enamines, nitroalkenes, oxidized sulfur species, and heterocycles). Further, the technology teaches the pollution prevention theme to younger generations of scientists and extends to in situ destruction of pollutants and hazardous waste.  Dr. Rajender S. Varma, Department of Chemistry and Texas Regional Institute for Environmental Studies, Sam Houston State University  Environmentally Benign Supramolecular Assemblies of Hydroquinones in Polaroid Instant Photography This technology represents the first example of supramolecular synthesis in a manufacturing system for pollution prevention. Using the concepts of molecular recognition and self-assembly, a new technique has been developed for the control of molecules within films and coatings. This process has a number of environmental benefits including reduced synthetic steps, reduced waste generation, reduced solvent usage, and the introduction of solventless or aqueous processing. Instead of performing several time consuming, solventbased, chemical reactions in order to synthesize a series of candidate compounds for structure activity studies, this technique allows for the addition of simple, inexpensive, 9  Dr. John Warner, Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts-- Boston Polaroid Corporation   readily available `complexing reagents.' For this to be successful as pollution prevention, these assemblies must significantly reduce the number of synthetic reactions carried out. Often the formation of these assemblies involve no organic solvents. The supramolecular structures can be constructed via solid state grinding or aqueous dispersing techniques.  Professor Marc A. Anderson, Water Chemistry Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison  Green Technolog y for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics The Green Technology for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics program is dedicated to both the fundamental understanding and practical environmental applications of microporous ceramic materials. These materials are typically used as thin porous films on a variety of supports for numerous applications. Such films are composed of nano-particulate oxides (i.e., 0.5 to 10 nm in diameter) that are either randomly close-packed to form membranes (i.e., 30 percent porosity) or more loosely packed to form catalysts, photocatalysts, and thin film energy storage devices. Because the particle size, surface chemistry, and particle packing of these oxides can be controlled, so can the pore size, pore size distribution, and the physical-chemical properties of these materials. As a result, the properties of these materials can be tailored for given applications which include reverse osmosis and gas separation membranes; high temperature membrane reactors; size and shape selective photolysis membranes; low temperature deep-oxidation catalysts; room temperature photocatalysts; and energy storage devices such as thin film batteries, ultracapacitors, and fuel cells. The Green Technology for the 21st Century: Microporous Ceramics program is illustrated using three examples: an indoor air cleaner for the complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds; an inorganic photoreactor for the size and shape selective synthesis of desired compounds with a minimum of waste; and, finally, an inexpensive, thin film ultracapacitor which exceeds the U.S. Department of Energy's near-term goal for this type of energy storage device.  Professor Larry T. Taylor, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties  A Nontoxic Liquid Metal Composition for Use as a Mercury Substitute Mercury is used extensively in switches and sensors, but it is toxic to humans and animals. In addition to being an excellent conductor of electricity, mercury has significant surface tension and, unlike any other metal known, remains fluid throughout a wide temperature range which encompasses 0 C. Because of these properties, mercury is found in numerous commercial products such as automobiles, thermostats, steam irons, pumps, computers, and even in tennis shoes. In each of these cases, mercury functions as a liquid electrical switch. Since billions of mercury switches are made worldwide each year, a nontoxic replacement appears highly desirable. A nontoxic, cost-effective alternative to mercury that has comparable performance characteristics has been identified at Virginia Tech. This green technology provides a gallium alloy containing indium, zinc, and copper that conducts electricity, freezes below 0 C, exhibits high surface tension, and possesses a very high boiling point and very low vapor pressure. In addition, nonmercury switches and sensors can replace mercury switches and sensors without modifying existing technology. Mercury also is used in temperature sensors, pressure activated switches, pumps and filters, slip rings, liquid mirror telescopes, fluid unions, dental amalgam, and in medical devices such as sphygmomanometers and bougies. The nonmercury material also can serve as a substitute for elemental mercury in a many of these applications.  10   Rational Design of Catalytic Reactions for Pollution Prevention Chemical products manufacturing is a major industrial source of toxic and hazardous chemicals. Catalytic technologies hold the key to the development of more environmentally benign chemical processes and for the continued improvement of existing processes. Historically, the design of chemical synthesis catalysts was extraordinarily empirical. Yields of desired products and operational characteristics were normally optimized based on suites of experiments run on catalysts made from various manufacturing conditions and blends. The ability to correlate catalyst behavior to catalyst surface features was extremely limited. Accordingly, predicting the desired catalyst features for a given application and, from that, formulating a catalyst manufacturing strategy, was essentially beyond reach. Moreover, the concept of redesigning catalysts so as to inhibit the formation of undesired coproducts, toxic materials, and wasteful pollutants was fanciful. A methodology for Rational Catalyst Technologies was developed at the University of Wisconsin that makes it possible to design and optimize catalysts by first understanding the nature of the desired catalyst surface and, from that, formulating the catalyst. This strategy for the rational design of catalytic reactions has found acceptance worldwide and has been applied successfully to link surface science research to the development of industrially important catalytic chemical reactions. Industrial collaborations or applications include ammonia catalysis, the environmental deNOx reaction, the water gas shift reaction on magnetite, titania surface species, molybdena and vanadia catalysts for clean partial oxidation of methane, and hydrocarbon cracking over acid Y-zeolite catalysts for the clean production of isobutylene.  Professor James A. Dumesic, Chemical Engineering Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison Dr. John C. Crittenden, National Center for Clean Industrial and Treatment Technologies, Michigan Technological University  The Replacement of Hazardous Organic Solvents with Water in the Manufacture of Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals The use of water as the primary solvent is a realistic approach to green chemistry and is a very desirable approach for reducing hazardous organic solvents from plant inventories. Multiphase reactors have been developed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and other universities that use water as the reaction medium in order to avoid the use of hazardous organic solvents in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. This is the first technology to show that free radical bromination of organics can be carried out in aqueous systems. A unique semicontinuous droplet reactor also has been developed for epoxidations. Before pollution prevention became fashionable, organic chemists found that water-based reactions gave higher yields at faster rates under milder conditions than organic solvent-based reactions. This is incentive enough for process change. The fact that these methods offer a new `non-end-of-pipe' method of eliminating volatile organic compounds adds a major incentive for process modification.  Dr. Henry Shaw, Chemistry and Environmental Science Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology Dr. Daniel J. Watts, Center for Environmental Engineering and Science, New Jersey Institute of Technology  The SYNGEN Program for Generation of Alternative Syntheses The SYNGEN program attempts to survey all possible synthetic routes to a target molecule and reduce the vast number of these possibilities quickly and stringently to focus on only the shortest and cheapest routes. The program first focuses on minimizing steps and the central role of prior skeletal dissection to find the best assemblies of the target skeleton from available starting skeletons. It then presents the ideal synthesis, of construction reactions only, to create the target just by sequential constructions uniting these starting skeletons. Finally, the digital basis rigorously, but concisely, defines all possible molecular structures and their reactions. This basis allows the new SYNGEN program to propose all 11  Professor James B. Hendrickson, Department of Chemistry, Brandeis University   of the short alternative syntheses of any product from real starting materials, in terms of both their cost and environmental impact.  Professor Tomas Hudlicky, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida  Synthetic Methodolog y `Without Reagents.' Tandem Enzymatic and Electrochemical Oxidations and Reductions in the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals The prevention of pollution at its source is addressed by the replacement of currently used methods of oxidation and reduction (all based on metal reagents) with enzymatic and electrochemical techniques (all performed in water, alcohols, or other environmentally acceptable solvents). The combination of enzymatic transformations with electrochemistry, along with efficient design, yields unprecedented brevity in the attainment of important pharmaceuticals from metabolites of the arene cis-diol type. Halogenated aromatic compounds, viewed in many cases as harmful to the environment, are enzymatically converted to useful synthons and effectively removed from the hazardous waste pool. The residual mass from enzymatic or electrochemical processes is judged suitable for disposal to municipal sewers, thus further reducing the amount of actual waste. The synthesis of a homochiral cyclitol from halobenzene by several steps involving essentially no reagents serves as the illustration of the technology. The nomination describes the strategy, logic, execution, and future projection of this program, which has potential global impact with attendant benefits to the health and economy of society through managed processing of aromatic waste to valuable substances. Several patents have already been granted on more efficient synthesis of pharmaceutical entities.  Professor David E. Nikles, Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama Professor J.W. Harrell, Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama Professor Alan M. Lane, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alabama Professor I.A. Jefcoat, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Alabama  Waterborne Coating Applications for Video Tape Manufacture Magnetic tape technology is an important component of the information age and maintaining a domestic tape manufacturing capability is important to the U.S. economy. Magnetic tape is manufactured by a continuous web coating process that uses organic solvents, including tetrahydrofuran, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), toluene and cyclohexanone. MEK, MIBK, and toluene are on the list of 189 hazardous air pollutants and on the list of 18 chemicals for the EPA's 33/50 voluntary pollution reduction program. Waterborne magnetic tape coating formulations were designed at the University of Alabama and used to prepare experimental magnetic tape samples in a pilot coating trial. The formulations contained a blend of a water-dispersed polyester and an ethylene/vinyl chloride copolymer emulsion. The coatings were thermally cured with a melamine-formaldehyde cross-linker to give tensile properties that were comparable to a standard solvent-based binder composition. The pilot tape trial used existing processing equipment, including calendering and slitting. The tape had good magnetic properties and excellent adhesion between the pigmented magnetic layer and the base film, easily exceeding the 8 mm helical scan tape standard of 0.96 N peel force. An economic impact analysis for the case of using the waterborne video tape coating process in a conventional tape manufacturing plant showed an 11 percent decrease in hourly operating costs. The solvent-based process generated almost 650 kg of organic solvent per hour operation, while the waterborne process generated less than 5 kg methanol (from the melamine-formaldehyde cross-linker) per hour. In addition to pollution prevention, there was a clear economic incentive to adopt the waterborne video tape manufacturing process.  12   Entries From Small Businesses Catalytic Extraction Processing (CEP) Catalytic Extraction Processing (CEP) is a proprietary technology that uses secondary materials and byproducts (that might otherwise be considered `wastes') as raw materials in a manufacturing process. CEP manufactures commercial products (i.e., industrial gases, alloys, and ceramics) from heterogeneous organic, organometallic, and inorganic materials using a molten metal bath as both a catalyst for elemental dissociation and a solution for reaction engineering. CEP feed materials go through two stages in the metal bath: dissociation and dissolution of molecular entities to their elements and reaction of these elemental intermediates to form products. The waste minimization and environmental performance of CEP is ensured by the separation of feed from product through elemental dissociation and the predictable partitioning afforded by the control of thermodynamic operating conditions. Employed as an offsite, closed-loop process unit, CEP maximizes environmental performance for a broad spectrum of secondary materials and byproducts through pollution prevention, waste minimization, and decreased demand on ever-diminishing natural resources. Molten Metal Technology, Inc.  Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLECs) as Robust and Broadly Applicable Industrial Catalysts Enzymes are proteins that function as highly efficient and selective catalysts. Enzymes are responsible for the biochemical reactions that are essential to life, and as such, they are unique in their intrinsic compatibility with living organisms. Their potential as safe and efficient industrial catalysts has been long recognized, but to date, enzymes have not exhibited the chemical and physical stability associated with more conventional, small-molecule organic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysts. Altus Biologics has developed a conceptually simple and broadly applicable solution to this fundamental problemthe formulation of enzymes in a cross-linked crystalline formthat enables enzyme use under the harsh chemical, physical, and mechanical conditions that characterize most practical industrial processes. To date, more than 20 enzymes have been formulated as CLECs and have demonstrated their utility on a pilot scale: as industrial catalysts, in consumer products such as detergents and cosmetics, as medical and process biosensors, and in the decontamination of waste and hazardous chemicals including insecticides and nerve agents. Two applications out of this broad portfolio of uses are describedthe CLEC-catalyzed syntheses of the dipeptide artificial sweetener aspartame and of the semi-synthetic b-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic cephalexin. In these applications, an enhancement in synthetic efficiency has been demonstrated, with dramatic source reductions in the waste streams associated with these processes. In addition to the potential broad impact of the crosslinked enzyme crystal technology on source reduction, widespread application of CLECs might also serve to leverage America's investment in the area of molecular biology beyond the preeminence already established in the biotechnology industry prototype. Novel, though otherwise impractical, enzymes derived from that technological base could, through their stabilization as CLECs, lead to a penetration and dominance of the much larger and employment-intensive commodity- and fine-chemical manufacturing industry; driven by the economic benefits derived from the implementation of more efficient, competitive, and `greener' chemical manufacturing options.  Altus Biologics Inc.  13   Benchmark Products, Inc.  Development of a Nickel Brightener Solution Historically, electroplaters of duplex nickel had to use formaldehyde and coumarinbearing nickel plating solutions to obtain a nonsulfur nickel deposit, which is essential to the duplex nickel process, for maximum corrosion protection of external automotive trim and bumpers. The Watts' bath, introduced in 1916, made it possible to increase the speed of nickel deposit by a factor of ten by increasing the electrical current density. This development lead to the bright nickel plating baths known today, which use organic and inorganic additives. Organic aromatic sulfonic acid was later introduced to the Watts' bath to achieve the first practical bright nickel plating solution. In 1936, formaldehyde was added to the solution followed in rapid succession by other additives. Coumarin, along with formaldehyde, became the important ingredients in a variety of nickel plating baths referred to as `semibright'. Today, semibright nickel plating occupies an important position in plating. Benchmark Products has developed a nickel brightener solution that, while improving the performance of electroplating, also significantly reduces the environmental impact by eliminating two toxic ingredients, formaldehyde and coumarin, and substituting nonhazardous ingredients.  Circuit Research Corporation  A Nontoxic, Nonflammable, Aqueous-Based Cleaner/Degreaser and Associated Parts Washing Systems Commonly Employed in the Automotive Repair Industry Circuit Research Corporation developed an aqueous based cleaner and associated parts washing system commonly employed in the automotive repair industry that eliminates the generation of hazardous waste associated with current parts washing systems. Currently, the majority of parts washers employ a `Stoddard Solvent,' which, when spent, is manifested as a hazardous waste to a distillation facility that separates the solvent from the petroleum residue. The new technology employs a nontoxic, nonflammable, aqueousbased cleaner/degreaser that can be recycled continuously on site by employing oil/water separation and standard combustion engine filters. Both the oil separation and filtration apparati are housed within a recently developed parts washer unit, such that the aqueous cleaner/degreaser is recycled in-situ, eliminating the removal or transportation and special treatment of spent cleaner material off site. Testing results have shown that: (1) the resulting oil skimmed from the cleaner can, under current hazardous waste definitions, be managed as a `spent oil' and combined with spent engine oil for beneficial reuse as a secondary fuel, and (2) the filter can be managed under current methods used to recycle other used combustion engine oil filters. Circuit Research Corporation believes there are in excess of 7,000 parts washers in Minnesota generating approximately 1.5 million gallons of spent Stoddard Solvent annually. Circuit Research Corporation's alternative technology could significantly reduce the generation of this waste.  Radiance Services Company  The Radiance Process: A Quantum Leap in Green Chemistry The Radiance Process, a new water- and chemical-free method of cleaning surfaces, is a powerful alternative to existing wet chemical processes that use detergents; organic solvents, including CFCs and their successors; and acid or alkaline reagents. The Radiance Process employs the quantum mechanical effects of laser light and an inert gas, ordinarily nitrogen, to clean surfaces. The light lifts the contaminant from the surface and the flowing gas sweeps it away. There is no pollution and no waste besides the removed contaminant itself. The Radiance Process will lead to significant human health and envi14   ronmental benefits through source reduction by reducing toxicity, flammability, explosion potential, emissions, discharges, use of hazardous substances in reaction conditions, the transport of hazardous substances, and the creation of hazardous wastes. The process is inexpensive and readily adaptable to many manufacturing needs. The process has been demonstrated on a broad range of products including semiconductor materials, such as silicon wafers and chrome on quartz photomasks, and industrial metals such as tire molds, fuel injectors, brass fixtures, and metal beverage containers. Semiconductor International called Radiance a ""breakthrough."" Advancing Microelectronics called it ""radical."" Futuretech called it ""indispensable."" In December 1995, the Radiance Process was selected by IndustryWeek magazine as a Technology of the Year, one of only five, calling it ""revolutionary."" Radiance provides the ultimate Green Chemistry by completely eliminating the need for chemicals in cleaning while achieving equal or superior results at a lower cost.  SuperCTM, The Use of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide The process SuperCTM permanently consumes large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) to make less-expensive, more durable, fully recyclable products from industrial wastes or ordinary cements. Even earth will serve as a material. SuperCTM is an economical answer to global warming and large-scale pollution. It employs simple reactions to sequester CO2, preventing it from entering the atmosphere. It provides lower cost alternatives to forest products, steel, aluminum, plastics, composites, and ceramics by using industrial waste streams as feedstocks. It can lengthen the service life of new, and even restore existing, concrete structures and infrastructures. It can stabilize cemented mixed and high-level nuclear waste to facilitate long-term storage without further chemical evolution. Implementation/conversion requires minimal capital investment. The process uses supercritical CO2 (at greater than 88.3 F and greater than 1,071 PSI) to infiltrate fully formed products made from wastes like fly ash, blast furnace slag, dust, clay, or from common cements, to produce almost any desired properties or behaviors. In this state, CO2 behaves as a super solvent. Products made this way cost less, are equal or superior in performance to those made in traditional ways, and are fully recyclable without manual segregation. They displace products made from higher energy or ecologically sensitive materials, and reduce environmental impact, health concerns, and fossil fuel consumption.  Materials Technology Limited  Utilization of High Performance, Environmentally Compliant Chemicals: GREEN LINE Adhesive, Sealant, and Coating Technologies Astutely aware of the national strategy for protecting the environment and promoting energy efficiency in buildings, American Chemical Corporation developed the GREEN LINE, a complete stock of specialty adhesives, sealants, and coatings that utilize environmentally compliant polyvinyl acetate (PVA), acrylic, latex, and epoxy resins technologies. All methodologies meet Best Available Technology (BAT) standards for minimizing VOC exposure, health risks, and hazardous handling practices. Concurrent with the technical development of GREEN LINE products was the conceptualization of Cost Benefit Algorithms and Dynamic Labeling, which permit federal managers to determine the degree of `green' compliance of the core materials used to manufacture the products and of the environmental improvements intended by use of such materials. Federal managers and their staffs are provided with reliable information that can help them make energy-saving, water-conserving, and maintenance improvements that solve environmental problems and provide for worker safety. GREEN LINE products have been successfully used to (1) reduce both energy use and the environmental impacts of HVAC and air handling distri15  American Chemical Corporation   bution system repairs and upgrades, (2) conserve potable water resources by facilitating the repair and rehabilitation of treatment, storage, and distribution systems, and (3) repair U.S. Naval ship structures.  Klenzoid, Inc.  Zero Discharge System For Cooling Towers The Zero Discharge system is a complete packaged water treatment system to control corrosion deposition and biological fouling with no water discharge (commonly known as `bleed-off ') from the system. This bleed-off is widely used by conventional water treatment programs to dilute the concentration of natural minerals in the water to prevent precipitation. In the Zero Discharge system, the recirculating cooling tower water is filtered by a side-stream filtration system to remove suspended solids. A microprocessor control monitors the prescribed characteristic of the recirculating water through sensors installed in a sample stream. The control maintains a programmed pH in the recirculating water along with prescribed levels of chemical treatment through actuation of chemical feed pumps. With these levels being maintained and monitored, the microprocessor, using stored tabular data, calculates the calcium content necessary to maintain a zero Langelier Saturation Index. The level of calcium is adjusted accordingly by regulating the flow of untreated raw water supplied to the tower as make-up through a bypass of a calcium removal (e.g., water softener or deionizer) system on the makeup water line. The health and environmental benefits of the Zero Discharge system are the result of the water saved and the significant reduction of chemicals discharged to the environment. The Zero Discharge system was patented in the early 1990s and has since been extensively applied in the metropolitan Philadelphia area. In total, about 30,000 tons of cooling water are being treated by the Zero Discharge system, which saves about 132 million gallons of water in the Philadelphia area annually.  16   Entries From Industry and Government AGROTAIN N-(n-butyl) Thiophosphoric Triamide Urea is now the favored form of solid nitrogen-containing fertilizer and is rapidly displacing anhydrous ammonia in the nitrogen fertilizer market. The market share of world nitrogen consumption has risen from 5 percent in 1962 to 37 percent in 1986 for urea. There are many reasons for this increase. Urea is a source of nitrogen for crop fertilization that is easily handled and transported, higher in nitrogen content than other common solid nitrogen fertilizers, and can be readily bulk blended with other fertilizer components, such as potassium chloride, diammonium phosphate, and other materials, to prepare multinutrient fertilizers. While urea has many advantages over other nitrogen sources and has already captured a greatly increasing market share, a major drawback to the use of urea is its tendency to lose a substantial portion of the nitrogen values by ammonia volatilization. These losses can easily exceed 30 percent of the available nitrogen in urea under certain climatic and soil conditions. AGROTAIN is a formulation containing N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) as the active ingredient, or, more correctly, the precursor to the active ingredient, which is the oxygen analog of NBPT. NBPT is a urease enzyme inhibitor that inhibits the hydrolysis of urea by inhibiting the activity of the urease enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea. This activity is the result of an interaction between the urease enzyme and the urease inhibitor. There is no interaction with soil microbes that generate the urease enzyme. Moreover, the recommended NBPT treatment rate is only 0.4 lbs/acre, and NBPT is relatively unstable and presents no problems with long-term buildup in the soil. The use of NBPT with urea also is ideally suited for no-till agriculture applications. No-till agriculture is an environmentally friendly approach that involves little or no disturbance of the topsoil, resulting in less soil erosion and less energy intensive operation. Urea, however, has not been well suited for use with surface-applied no-till applications until the advent of NBPT because of the possibility of substantial ammonia volatilization losses. IMC-Agrico Company  Alkyl Polyglycoside Surfactants Henkel Corporation's alkyl polyglycoside (APG) surfactants are a class of nonionic surfactants that have been pioneered and marketed to the detergent and personal care industries under the Glucopon and Plantaren trade names since 1992 and 1990, respectively. APG surfactants are manufactured from renewable resources including fatty alcohol, derived from coconut and palm oils, and glucose, derived from corn starch. APG surfactants are more innocuous to the environment than petrochemical-based technologies, are readily biodegradable, and have very low ecotoxicity. APG surfactants are highly efficient cleaners and have led to a significant reduction in overall chemical consumption in cleaner formulations and ultimately the amount of chemicals released to the environment. APG surfactants also permit the formulation of concentrated cleaners that require less consumer product packaging and consequently reduce packaging waste. APG surfactants are considerably less toxic and safer to humans and the environment than other major surfactants. APG surfactants permit the formulation of less irritating and safer consumer products and significantly reduce the possible environmental impact associated with an accidental spill. Henkel Corporation's 50 million pound per year APG surfactant plant 17  Henkel Corporation   has been operating in Cincinnati, Ohio, since 1992. A second plant was started up in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1995, by Henkel Corporations's parent company, Henkel KGaA.  U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing  An Alternative Solvent, Isomet The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (the Bureau), the world's largest security manufacturing establishment, produces currency, postage stamps, revenue stamps, naturalization certificates, U.S. savings bonds, and other government securities and documents. Until 1991, Typewash, a solvent mixture, was used by the Bureau for cleaning typographic seals and serial numbers of the COPE-Pack (overprinting presses) and for cleaning of sleeves of postage stamp presses. Typewash is a solvent mixture composed of methylene chloride (55 percent), toluene (25 percent), and acetone (20 percent). The use of Typewash was no longer in compliance with the District of Columbia Environmental Law and the Federal Air Toxic Law. An alternative solvent, Isomet, was designed and developed to replace Typewash. Isomet is a mixture of isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (55 percent), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (10 percent), and isopropyl alcohol (35 percent). Isomet is less toxic, less polluting, and environmentally friendly. Isomet was found to be acceptable in the areas of (1) cleaning ability, (2) solvent evaporation rate, (3) solvent odor, (4) environmental and safety compliance, and (5) cost. Thus, a solvent discharged at the rate of 7,500 gallons per year was made environmentally friendly. The performance of Isomet is excellent and it has been used for cleaning all postage stamp and overprinting presses in the Bureau.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Application of Freeze Drying Technolog y to the Separation of Complex Nuclear Waste The nuclear industry must comply with increasingly stringent standards for radioactive material levels present in liquid effluents. Current conventional methods of decontamination include distillation, ion exchange, precipitation reactions, or chelating agents. Freeze drying technology (FDT) has been applied to the decontamination of radioactive liquids and shown to be thousands of times more effective than conventional methods. Distillation, ion exchange, and chelating agents often require multiple passes, and because additional components (e.g., resins or chelating agents, which in turn must be disposed of as radioactive) are typically required for these methods, reductions in the volume of radioactive waste are rarely realized. FDT will efficiently separate solvents and volatile acids from complex waste solutions and process liquids. The separated liquids will be virtually free of radioactive contamination and can be reused or discarded as nonradioactive. FDT will drastically reduce the volume of radioactive wastes. Volume reductions greater than 1,000 times have been achieved in aqueous solutions, but the exact volume reduction of nuclear waste will depend on its moisture content. FDT will eliminate the need for storage or destruction of the liquid component and will lower transportation costs because of volume and weight reductions. In addition, this technology can be considered safe; no high temperatures or pressures are used. The process occurs in a vacuum, so the failure of a component would lead to an inward leak and the potential for contamination outside the system is significantly reduced. Finally, the refrigerant used in this technology is environmentally friendly liquid nitrogen.  18   Application of Green Chemistry Principles to Eliminate Air Pollution From the Mexican Brickmaking Microindustry A new recirculating design for small brickmaking kilns was investigated as an alternative to conventional operations, which are a significant source of air pollution. The bricks used in building many houses and office buildings in Mexico and other parts of the third world are typically made by hand and fired in small kilns using available fuels such as sawdust, treated wood, paper, trash, tires, plastic, and used motor oil. Although these bricks cost about half of standard high-fired construction bricks, they do not meet the minimum strength requirements for commercial construction in the United States. In addition, a major byproduct of this brickmaking industry is a high level of air pollution--both particulates and toxic chemicals--that results from inefficient thermal design of the kilns and the use of cheap but readily available fuels. This industry is the third leading cause of air pollution in the El Paso-Jurez area. Redesign of the kilns to allow efficient energy recovery and to eliminate waste from over- and under-firing makes the use of nonpolluting fuels (e.g., natural gas) economically attractive. The design challenge is to use inexpensive, readily available materials and equipment to avoid significant capital outlay. Laboratory investigations and process modeling were performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and field tests are being performed at ECOTEC in Ciudad Jurez, Mexico, in cooperation with FEMAP, a private foundation in Mexico, and with the El Paso Natural Gas Company. The direct benefits of these improvements in the brickmaking process are reduced air pollution, safer operating conditions, and better bricks. In addition, process modeling indicates that fuel consumption can be reduced by approximately 55 percent and cost analyses project that this will result in an increase in profit of about 35 percent for the brickmakers.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Application of Microchemistry Technolog y to the Analysis of Environmental Samples `Green' chemistry is an umbrella term addressing such related concepts as waste minimization, pollution prevention, solvent substitution, environmentally conscious manufacturing, maximum atom utilization, technologies for a sustainable future, environmental security, and industrial ecology. Another applicable concept, microscale chemistry (or microchemistry), is the application of chemical principles and apparatus at a scale much smaller than currently employed by most bench chemists, thus reducing the volume of reagents and product by several orders of magnitude. Microscale and green chemistries both incorporate waste minimization, pollution prevention, and solvent substitution. Adoption of green and microscale methods is increasingly essential for the environmental analytical community as regulations tighten, the costs of waste disposal escalate, and public scrutiny increases. By applying green chemistry principles and using advances in separation science, instrumentation, microscale techniques, and solvent substitution, chemists at Argonne National Laboratory developed trace environmental analysis methods that incorporate source reduction. The techniques reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous solvents, decrease analysis turnaround time, and significantly reduce the generation of secondary wastes associated with analytical processing. The success of these methods exemplifies the opportunities to reduce waste generation at analytical laboratories across the country. With appropriate institutional advocacy, these principles can be applied broadly to this large chemical sector.

After the useful life of some products, the final disposition depends on various options. The products can enter the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream to a landfill, an incinerator, or an incinerator with electricity/steam production. They also can be discarded on land or at sea, be recycled by industry, or be reused for another purpose by the consumer. One growing option, which Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766 is designed to complement, is composting. This is a process that essentially mimics nature's biodegradation process (i.e., carbon cycle) and has been used over the ages to various degrees. The process is now recognized to have various benefits, one of which is the reduction of the amount of waste to landfills or incinerators (both of which are expensive to build and maintain, not to mention the problems inherent with siting a new one). In addition, the compost resulting from biodegradation is a soil amendment that adds water retention and other benefits to soils. In fact, such a compost is more beneficial to agricultural soil regeneration than chemical fertilizers. Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766, a patented aliphatic/aromatic copolyester of adipic acid, terephthalic acid, and 1,4butanediol, was engineered to decompose under proper conditions into water, carbon dioxide, and biomass. This innovative new product also exhibits such features as low cost, tensile properties similar to low density polyethylene (LDPE), and a soft feel, and is blendable with natural polymers such as starch. Extensive biodegradation and toxicity evaluations demonstrated definitively that Eastman's new product biodegrades completely at rates comparable to paper without negatively impacting the ecosystem. The material can be extruded into blown film, extrusion coated, and spun into fiber. A plethora of applications is envisioned for Eastman Biodegradable Copolyester 14766 including compost bags, personal hygiene items, medical products, and coated paper and board.  Eastman Chemical Company  Biofiltration Technolog y Biofiltration has been used for decades in the United States in towns and cities for odor control, and has also been used in Europe. American companies, however, have been hesitant to consider the natural process because it is so different from the widely accepted conventional control technologies. As part of Tennessee Eastman Division's (TED) Odor Identification and Control Program, a 1,400 cubic feet per minute gas stream was determined to be a `priority' odor source. Though the vent was, at the time, treated by a 12C-20 caustic scrubber, a hydrogen sulfide odor was detected. One obvious solution to the odor problem was to increase the frequency of the caustic changeouts. This increased frequency would greatly increase the operation expenses for the scrubber as well as expose operations to greater risks of caustic burns resulting from the increased handling requirements. As an alternative to caustic treatment, biofiltration was investigated as a possible solution. In biofiltration, micro-organisms supported on a stationary porous media bed are used to destroy pollutants from waste gases flowing through the bed. The micro-organisms commonly occur in nature, and various media are excellent candidates for sustaining the micro-organisms and harboring their nutrients. In July 1993, a pilot biofilter was set up to test its effectiveness on hydrogen sulfide removal. The pilot biofilter proved that biofiltration was a technically feasible and economically attractive alternative to the 12C-20 caustic scrubber for hydrogen sulfide removal from the vent gas stream. Due to this success, a fullscale biofilter, 12C-1022, was installed in December 1995 to replace the 12C-20 caustic scrubber.  20   CleanSystem3 Gasoline Internal combustion engines produce considerable amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx) as a combustion byproduct. NOx are an air pollutant in their own right and react with atmospheric organic compounds in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, a powerful respiratory irritant. Despite a 76 percent reduction in allowable NOx emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles over the past 25 years, U.S. motor vehicles still emit 3 million tons of NOx each year. Source reduction in the context of vehicular NOx means less NOx generated in the engine. Steps in this direction have been few (primarily exhaust gas recirculation) and, being a design feature, are not applicable to older vehicles. There is, therefore, a genuine opportunity for technology which can reduce the NOx generated in vehicle engines on the road today. Texaco has developed and introduced a patented additive technology based on novel chemistry which reduces NOx formation in gasoline engines. This additive is present in all CleanSystem3 gasoline sold in the United States. Controlled vehicle testing has demonstrated reductions in tailpipe NOx up to 22 percent. This additive fulfills the role of traditional deposit control (`detergent') additives in keeping fuel system components clean, and provides additional performance in the area of preventing and removing combustion chamber deposits. Cleaner combustion chambers retain less combustion heat from one engine cycle to the next, and the resulting lower temperature leads to the formation of fewer NOx.  Texaco, Inc.  Development and Implementation of Low Vapor Pressure Cleaning Solvent Blends and Waste Cloth Management Systems to Capture Cleaning Solvent Emissions Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems (LMTAS) (formerly General Dynamics Fort Worth Division) has developed low vapor pressure organic solvents. LMTAS patented these solvent blends and the technology is being used by the aerospace industry, the military, and various industries. Additionally LMTAS substituted one of the new solvent blends (DS-104) for a CFC-113 based general purpose cleaning solvent used in the surface wiping of aircraft parts, components, and assemblies in all aspects of aircraft manufacturing. The substitution resulted in major reductions in solvent use and air emissions, the elimination of ozone depleting compounds from cleaning during aircraft assembly, cost reductions, and improved chemical handling and usage practices. From 1986 to 1992, LMTAS produced mainly F-16 fighter aircraft at a rate of 220 to 350 aircraft per year. Throughout the 6 years, LMTAS used a general purpose wipe solvent containing 85 percent CFC-113 by weight throughout the manufacturing process. The use of the CFC-113 solvent blend resulted in the emission of approximately 255 tons per year of CFC-113 and 45 tons per year of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The implementation of DS-104 at LMTAS has reduced wipe solvent VOC emissions to 7 tons per year in 1993, 3 tons per year in 1994, and 2 tons per year in 1995, with no CFC emissions. After the LMTAS implementation, other companies and military operations throughout the United States have implemented this technology. Additionally, this technology has been implemented in several countries, such as Australia, Canada, Greece, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, and Turkey. Several other European countries will implement this technology in 1997. This technology was developed primarily for aerospace; however, it has found applications in many other industries such as automotive, various prison manufacturing operations, postal operations, electronics, building maintenance, steel, and nondestructive testing methods.  Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems  21   Rochester Midland Corporation  Development of a New `Core' Line of Cleaners Cleaning is an important practice and necessity of modern civilization. An effective cleaner must be able to penetrate through soil to disrupt and destroy the complicated types of bonding that cause it to adhere to the surface being cleaned. Most modern cleaners are comprised of surface active agents derived from petrochemical resources. While these components are effective, they tend to be environmentally harsh and depend upon a natural resource whose supply is finite and limited. The market for these products is estimated to be in the range of $5 billion, which equates to approximately 5 billion pounds of product annually. The impact of developing chemistries that are less polluting during the extraction, manufacturing, use, and disposal of these products is, therefore, quite significant, as are the human health and safety impacts. During the past few years a new family of cleaners was developed that are less toxic and have reduced impacts to both people and the environment when compared to traditional products used for the same purpose. The chemistries incorporated into these products resulted in products that are readily biodegradable, comprised of zero to very low volatile organic components and ozone depleting substances, effective in their intended purpose (i.e., cleaning), and economically competitive. In addition, these products have low human and aquatic toxicity and low corrosivity. Main molecular components of these products are derived from renewable, bio-based resources that are lower polluting and typically less toxic than their petrochemical alternatives. This new `core' line of cleaners is an innovative approach to the formulation of an important series of products and is the safest yet developed in its field.  U.S. Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  DOE Methods for Evaluating Environmental and Waste Management Samples DOE Methods for Evaluating Environmental and Waste Management Samples (DOE Methods) is a document that provides new technology and consolidated methods to analytical chemistry laboratories around the country. These laboratories are working on one of the world's most challenging environmental issues: Cold War legacy waste. Sampling and analytical technologies that minimize waste production are given priority over traditional methods. It has been demonstrated, for example, that some of the technologies produce 60 to 70 percent less hazardous and radioactive waste than other available technologies. The guidance information in DOE Methods also helps minimize the number of analyses and saves time and money. Guidelines are provided on how to (1) efficiently develop a sampling and analysis program, (2) effectively and efficiently sample waste, (3) handle radioactive samples safely, and (4) select appropriate analytical methods. Cross references allow the users to select from currently available standard methodologies. DOE Methods has been available for both DOE and commercial use since 1992. It is updated every 6 months, thereby accelerating the release of new technology to speed EM operations. The significance of the document is in its unique application to the analysis of radioactive components and highly radioactive mixed waste. The document currently contains about 65 sampling and analytical methods, many of which are focused on the mixed-waste issue. The highly challenging world of environmental problems cannot be solved without effective sampling and analytical methods. DOE Methods takes a major step in the resolution of this problem.  22   DryWashTM Carbon Dioxide Dry Cleaning Technolog y DryWashTM is a patented, Hughes-specific liquid carbon dioxide garment dry cleaning technology and is a safe, ecologically acceptable, and cost effective alternative dry cleaning process. Currently, the dry cleaning industry uses perchloroethylene (PCE) (85 percent of establishments), petroleum-based or stoddard solvents (12 percent of establishments), CFC-113 (less than 2 percent of establishments), and 1,1,1 trichloroethane. All conventional dry cleaning solvents present health risks, safety risks, or are environmentally detrimental. PCE is a suspected carcinogen, petroleum-based solvents are flammable and smog producing, and CFC-113 is an ozone depletor and targeted to be phased out by the end of 1995. Health risks due to exposure to cleaning solvents and the high costs of implementing and complying with safety and environmental restrictions and regulations, have made dry cleaning a much more difficult business in which to achieve profitability. Solvents are suspected of contaminating ground water, air, and food products (i.e., in nearby markets). For these reasons, there is an ongoing search for alternative, safe, and environmentally friendly cleaning technologies, substitute solvents, and methods to control exposure to dry cleaning chemicals. DryWashTM reuses carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring byproduct of combustion that is a readily available, inexpensive, and unlimited natural resource. It is also chemically stable, noncorrosive, nonflammable, nonozone depleting, and nonsmog producing. Performance has been demonstrated to major dry cleaning equipment manufacturers worldwide and to the EPA. Actual garments, along with International Fabricare Institute (IFI) standardized cleaning test fabrics, were used for the demonstrations. The performance of the DryWashTM cleaning process was quantified favorably against commercial perchloroethylene cleaning by Los Alamos National Laboratory, using IFI standards.  Hughes Environmental Systems, Inc.  The DUCARE `Zero Effluent' Recycle Chemistry System The printing and publishing pre-press industry is undergoing a revolutionary change driven by advances in imaging technology from a craft-based industry to one relying far more on digital imaging and printing technology. From a user perspective, this new technology is more environmentally benign than the process it replaces. Several iterations of improvements in hardware and software will be required before digital imaging completely replaces conventional chemical imaging. The DUCARE system is a `bridge' between the current and developing systems. It is designed as a `drop in' for conventional processing and enables the customer to continue utilizing their current equipment, thus avoiding a financial burden while still eliminating the adverse environmental impact. DUCARE is an environmentally proactive way for customers to prevent any film processor effluent from going down their drain. Typically, customers discharge the effluent to the drain, pay to have it hauled away and disposed, or use expensive high maintenance equipment for onsite treatment. The effluent contains hazardous chemicals (as defined by SARA Title III), very high BOD and COD, and high silver and pH extremes. DUCARE, offered only by DuPont, solves these problems using several industry firsts. A new developer was invented which has no SARA Title III chemicals and is based on a vitamin C isomer. The chemistry is designed to use 25 to 40 percent less product than conventional chemistry and is recycled at its manufacturing sites to insure high quality and `like new' performance. The wash-water recirculating unit reduces water use up to 99 percent. This system can be used worldwide, wherever a cost effective reverse distribution system can be set up.  DuPont Company  23   California-Pacific Lab & Consulting  The ECO Funnel The ECO Funnel and Container is a new product designed to prevent volatile toxic air contaminants from evaporating into the laboratory work environment and into the atmosphere through the laboratory fume hood system. Typically, a simple funnel is used in pouring waste solvent into a waste bottle or carboy. In most cases, the funnel is left on top of the bottle permanently during the day, resulting in significant emission due to evaporation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the bottle into the laborator y environment or fume hood. It may seem that contamination of the atmosphere from such sources may not be large enough to be important or significant; however, exact measurements have proven the contrary. For example, an 8-liter carboy filled with 8 liters of dichloromethane will emit 500 mL (1.5 pounds) of this solvent into the atmosphere in 5 days. The emission will vary depending on the type of solvents used. The fume hood face velocity also can affect the evaporation rate. However, for a typical fume hood at 700 cubic feet per minute and a typical 4 liter waste bottle with a regular funnel containing 1000 mL tetrahydrofuran, 1000 mL acetone, and 1500 mL dichloromethane, the emission rate was 0.09 pounds per 8 hours or 33 pounds per year. California-Pacific Lab and Consulting designed and patented a new funnel that has a lid connected to a shut-off ball that double seals the system. The funnel stem is also longer and sealed to the bottle cap in order to prevent emission from the side of the stem. Under the same conditions as described above for the 4-liter waste bottle with a standard funnel, the ECO Funnel and Container resulted in zero emissions.  IBM-Austin  Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Chemicals in the Printed Wire Board and Electronic Assembly and Test Processes IBM-Austin is a manufacturing and development facility. Operations include the manufacture of printed wire board (PWB) in the Panel Plant facility and electronic circuit cards in the Electronic Card Assembly and Test (ECAT) facility. In 1992, IBM-Austin completely eliminated the use of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances from its PWB and ECAT processes. This elimination program resulted in 100 percent reduction of CFC113 (1988 peak usage of approximately 432,000 pounds) and 100 percent reduction of methyl chloroform (1988 peak usage of approximately 308,000 pounds) from IBMAustin's PWB and ECAT processes. These accomplishments were achieved by converting to an aqueous-based photolithographic process in the PWB facility in 1989, an interim aqueous cleaning process in the ECAT facility in 1991 and 1992, and a final No-Clean process (eliminating the aqueous cleaning process) in the ECAT facility. Changing from a solvent-based photolithographic process to an aqueous-based process eliminated methyl chloroform (MCF) from PWB panel manufacturing (1988 usage of 181,000 pounds). The interim process changes to aqueous cleaning eliminated MCF from manufacturing processes in ECAT (1989 peak usage of 196,000 pounds) and were largely responsible for eliminating CFC-113 from all manufacturing processes at the IBM site. Although CFC113 was eliminated from the site in 1991 and MCF was eliminated in 1992, ECAT 's ultimate goal was to convert all ECAT processes to No-Clean manufacturing processes. This conversion was completed in 1993.  24   Environmental Improvements From Redesigning the Commercial Manufacture of Progesterone For more than 40 years, the steroid bisnoraldehyde (BNA) has been produced at Pharmacia & Upjohn because it is a key intermediate for the commercial synthesis of progesterone and corticosteroid classes of pharmaceuticals. Recently, a redesigned route to BNA was implemented. This new synthetic route to progesterone is founded on both the development of a new fermentation process which improves the utilization of a renewable, naturally derived feedstock from 15 to 100 percent, and the development of a chemical oxidation process that offers high selectivity and reduced waste streams. The fermentation employs a genetically modified bacterium to convert soya sterols directly to a new synthetic intermediate, bisnoralcohol. The new chemical process oxidizes bisnoralcohol to bisnoraldehyde, a key intermediate for the registered, commercial manufacture of progesterone. Contrary to standard chemical methods for oxidizing alcohols to aldehydes, the nominated process does not use hazardous or noxious materials and does not generate toxic waste streams. The new bisnoralcohol route exemplifies the synergism possible between biochemical and chemical process development. It eliminated a process with a running, recycled inventory of 60,000 gallons of ethylene dichloride (EDC), a known carcinogen, which needed up to 5,000 gallons of EDC input annually. The new route produces the same amount of product as the previous route with 89 percent less nonrecoverable organic solvent waste and 79 percent less aqueous waste. The new route also has the chemical selectivity required for high quality bulk pharmaceutical manufacture and can be applied to the oxidation of other primary alcohols. By implementing this redesigned, commercial synthesis of BNA, Pharmacia & Upjohn has substantially reduced the chemical waste associated with manufacturing progesterone, while simultaneously improving process economics through a dramatic increase in feedstock utilization.  Pharmacia & Upjohn  Environmentally-Driven Preparation of Insensitive Energetic Materials An innovative approach was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to synthesize 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) and other insensitive energetic materials through the use of Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution chemistry (VNS). TATB is a reasonably powerful insensitive high explosive (IHE), whose thermal and shock stability is considerably greater than that of any other known material of comparable energy. The high cost of TATB ($100 per pound) has precluded its use for civilian applications such as deep-hole oil explorations. TATB is manufactured in the United States by nitration of the relatively expensive and domestically unavailable 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB) to give 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TCTNB), which is then aminated to yield TATB. The new VNS method developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for the synthesis of TATB has many `environmentally friendly' advantages over the current method of synthesis of TATB. Most significantly, it allows the elimination of chlorinated species from the synthesis of insensitive energetic materials. The new synthesis of TATB uses unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), a surplus propellant from the former Soviet Union, and ammonium picrate (Explosive D), a high explosive, as starting materials in lieu of the chlorinated species, TCB. Several million pounds of Explosive D are targeted for disposal in the United States; 30,000 metric tons of UDMH also await disposal in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. The use of these surplus energetic materials as feedstocks in the new VNS method of synthesizing TATB allows an improved method of demilitarization of conventional munitions that also should offer significant savings in production, thereby making this IHE more accessible for civilian applications.  U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Munitions U.S. Department of Energy, Weapons Supported Research Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  25   Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems  Implementation and Verification of Aqueous Alkaline Cleaners Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems (LMTAS) was the first aerospace company to implement innovative aqueous cleaning technology for cleaning tubing and honeycomb core. Tubing is used in the aerospace industry for transferring pressurized oxygen within an aerospace vehicle. Honeycomb core is used in the aerospace industry for producing bonded structural parts. Both applications require that the parts meet stringent cleanliness requirements. These requirements were previously met by using cold cleaning or vapor degreasing with chlorinated solvents. These solvents included 1,1,1-trichloethane (TCA) and trichloroethylene (TCE). These chlorinated solvents are toxic, and TCA is an ozone depleting compound. The use of chlorinated solvents posed a threat to the environment because the solvents were commonly released into the air during cleaning operations and because the likelihood of a spill during their use was significant. These solvents were successfully replaced with aqueous cleaning technology. As of November 1993, 100 percent of tubing manufactured at LMTAS (including oxygen tubing) is being cleaned in an aqueous cleaning system. As of May 1994, 100 percent of all honeycomb core used at LMTAS is also being cleaned in an aqueous cleaning system. Implementation of aqueous cleaning technology at LMTAS eliminated approximately 360 tons of air emissions per year and resulted in a cost savings of $490,000 per year. In addition to replacing chlorinated solvents with the innovative aqueous cleaning technology, LMTAS also explored the use of environmentally safe methods for quantifying surface contaminants on parts cleaned by various cleaning technologies. Traditionally, extraction with CFC-113 followed by gravimetric or FTIR analysis has been used for quantifying surface contaminants. The use of CFC-113 is undesirable due to its ozone depleting potential. LMTAS has demonstrated the usefulness of carbon dioxide coulometry for determining the amount of residue remaining on a surface after cleaning and has used this technique for comparing the cleaning effectiveness of various cleaning technologies.  DuPont Company  The INFINITY Process The INFINITY dyeing process was developed as an alternative method to manage the dyeing cycle for nylon textiles. Over 8 billion pounds of nylon textiles are consumed each year and most are dyed to meet aesthetic and functional demands. In the United States alone, consumption of dyes for nylon exceeds 30 million pounds, much of which is left in the spent dye bath after the fabric is dyed. This waste must be treated to avoid pollution of downstream waterways. Mills are meeting regulatory requirements through conventional process control techniques and end-of-pipe treatment. The INFINITY dyeing process lets mills reduce their consumption of dyes and other chemicals by 25 percent, and, in some applications, water and steam use per dye cycle is cut in half. Conventional methods use up to 4,000 gallons of water, 20 pounds of dye, and 10 pounds of dye assist chemicals per 1,000 pounds of fabric. The INFINITY dyeing process uses only 75 percent of the dye previously required, half the water, and less dye assist chemicals to get the same fabric color. In addition, dye discharge into mill effluent streams can be reduced as much as tenfold. A mill with a 90 percent exhaust rate may discharge 500 pounds of unused dye into the mill's wastewater treatment stream each week. With INFINITY, the same mill can move to 99 percent exhaust, reducing the amount of dye discharged to 50 pounds per week; a significant step toward attacking waste at the source. The process is currently being used at nylon textile mills in the United States, and work has begun on the feasibility of using the process on wool, cotton, and polyester blend fabrics. Cost savings by most mills using this process could easily exceed $100,000 per year.  26   Innovative Techniques for Chemical and Waste Reductions in the Printed Wire Board Circuitize Process IBM produces 1.7 million square feet of multilayer circuit boards per year in a manufacturing plant in north Austin, Texas. Aqueous chemical baths and rinse water are processed at a pretreatment plant where acidity is neutralized and dissolved copper is removed prior to discharge to a sanitary sewer for further treatment in a POTW. In 1991, the treatment process produced 1,417 tons of metal hydroxide sludge, a RCRA F006 hazardous waste. In 1992, a team of environmental engineers, manufacturing engineers, and laboratory personnel was formed to reduce hazardous waste sludge generation at the water treatment plant by minimizing waste generation in the imaging line. Areas of key importance to sludge reduction were identified as acid used in cleaning operations and developing solutions used prior to etching operations. Minimizing acid in the waste water reduces the amount of lime needed to neutralize the waste water. Reducing the developing solution reduces the carbonates in the waste water that precipitate as calcium carbonate in the presence of lime. By 1994, the team accomplished a 90 percent reduction in hydrochloric acid used in cleaning for an annual savings of approximately $340,000 in chemical cost. Additional work allowed for a 40 percent reduction of developing and stripping solutions used in the imaging area, for an annual savings of approximately $75,000. These changes resulted in an approximately 75 percent decrease in use of lime at the pretreatment plant. This decrease, in combination with reduced carbonate usage in developing solutions, resulted in a decrease in sludge production of over 670 tons per year (based on first half 1994 results) and a 47 percent reduction from 1991 sludge generation, for an additional savings of $250,000 in sludge disposal costs. This project has shown that waste minimization through chemical source reduction can reduce expenses as well as reduce waste.  IBM-Austin  INVERT Solvents in Aircraft Paint Stripping Recent changes in regulations affecting the aircraft stripping industry have resulted in increased research into new, more environmentally and toxicologically friendly formulations. The Dow Chemical Company has developed a new line of solvent continuous microemulsions, which have merit in aircraft paint stripping, to aid in the reduction of regulated chemicals as well as lower flammability and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels. These solvent products are marketed under the INVERT trademark. Formulating with INVERT solvents allows for the inclusion of greater than 40 percent water in aircraft paint strippers so that worker exposure to chemicals, flammability, and VOC levels can be reduced. INVERT solvents are solvent continuous microemulsions that contain approximately 50 percent water, low surfactant levels (i.e., less than 5 percent), and approximately 45 percent solvents and cosolvents. Paint stripping formulations can easily be prepared, using INVERT as a base, through the addition of active stripping solvents along with performance enhancing ingredients such as thickeners, activators, and evaporation retardants. Hydrocarbon-based stripper formulations often have low flash points and high VOC levels. The incorporation of water significantly increases fire point, and water addition reduces VOC levels. INVERT solvents offer an economical and effective way to incorporate water into hydrocarbon-based strippers to reduce flammability and VOC concerns without sacrificing performance. When methylene chloride is used as a stripping solvent, exposure and regulatory issues may call for a reduction in use level. The use of INVERT solvent technology allows preparation of solvent continuous microemulsions with low methylene chloride content (i.e., less than 20 percent), while maintaining an excellent level of performance. The use of INVERT solvents in the aircraft stripping industry allows users to reduce worker exposure to regulated chemicals and to reduce emissions of volatile chemicals, while maintaining a high standard of performance and economic benefit. 27  The Dow Chemical Company   Praxair, Inc.  Liquid Oxidation Reactor (LOR) Praxair, Inc. has developed a unique process that allows the safe oxidation of organic chemicals with pure or nearly pure oxygen. This technology, known as the Liquid Oxidation Reactor (LOR), provides significant environmental advantages compared to conventional, air-based oxidation processes. The use of oxygen in place of air reduces the total gas throughput to the reactor, thereby reducing the compression energy and the amount of vent gas that must be treated prior to atmospheric release. In addition, the oxygen use can positively affect the chemistry of the reaction, allowing the operation of the process at lower temperatures or pressures, thereby improving selectivity without sacrificing production rate. The use of the Praxair LOR increases the overall rate of reaction and volumetric productivity of hydrocarbon oxidations while increasing selectivity and reducing the loss of solvent and reactant to carbon oxides. The increased chemical efficiency with oxygen results in substantial raw materials cost saving, and a 96 percent reduction in the quantity of waste gases. The cost of product purification and waste disposal is reduced substantially. In addition, the lower temperature operations afforded by the LOR process reduces the loss of reactant or solvent to byproducts and to waste streams that also can contribute to environmental problems and must be treated prior to release. The LOR will enable a large and important segment of the U.S. chemical industry to realize more efficient use of raw materials, reduced environmental emissions, and energy savings. Because the LOR also allows for higher productivity, lower capital costs, and, consequently, improves competitiveness, there are significant incentives for the implementation of the technology. Average operating-cost savings and productivity gains worth $5 to $20 million per plant per year have been projected.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Magnetic Separation for Treatment of Radioactive Liquid Waste High Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) is the application of intense magnetic fields to selectively separate solids from other solids, liquids, or gases. The HGMS process has demonstrated promise for the treatment of waste streams containing actinide at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The caustic liquid waste generated by operations in the LANL Plutonium Processing Facility (TA-55) can produce up to 30,000 L of liquid effluent annually, with an average alpha activity of 1010 dpm/L. Treatment and disposal of the liquid effluents at the LANL Waste Water Treatment Facility (TA-50) can ultimately produce up to 15 tons of TRU solid waste per year. In order to avoid the TA-50 treatment, the goal at TA-55 is to reduce the radioactivity in the waste streams to less than 5.8 x 105 dpm/L. Physical separation processes, such as HGMS, are particularly attractive because no additional waste is generated during processing. HGMS is capable of concentrating the actinides in process waste streams to form a low volume, actinide-rich stream for recycling, and a high-volume, actinide-lean stream for direct discard. The proposed technology has been demonstrated successfully on a laboratory scale at TA-55 where results from screening experiments on radioactive caustic liquid waste water indicate that over 99.9 percent extraction of Pu activity can be achieved using HGMS (represents decontamination levels of three orders of magnitude to about 4.4 x 105 dpm/L). The application of this technology to radioactive liquid waste effluents would eliminate radioactivity from the source, in addition to reducing the volume of transuranic solid waste that is produced with the current treatment technologies. The hazard of pumping radioactive liquid waste to offsite facilities would also be eliminated because treatment of TA-55 effluent would occur prior to transportation.  28   NAFION Membrane Technolog y Membrane technology is now recognized as state-of-the-art for chloralkali chemical production, which constitutes the second largest commodity chemical volume produced globally. NAFION membranes are acknowledged as the world leader in bringing about a technology `revolution,' which has made the membrane electrolyzer system the technology of choice over the incumbent mercury amalgam cells and asbestos diaphragm electrolyzers. While significantly reducing the environmental impact of the old technologies, membrane systems confer the advantages of a new electrolysis process with lower investment and lower operating costs. Before NAFION and membrane technology, the production of chloralkali chemicals was dependent on either mercury amalgam cells or asbestos diaphragm systems. While these systems may be operated safely, they pose health and environmental concerns in use and disposal. Membranes, such as NAFION, now offer a more environmentally friendly and economically attractive alternative, which accounts for the rapid global adoption of membrane technology. Another rapidly emerging application of NAFION is in the area of alternative energy, where electricity is produced from the `combustionless burning' of hydrogen with oxygen in air via a membrane fuel cell. Fuel cell technology, with hydrogen as a fuel, is pollution-free. NAFION membranes often are cited in the many commercial developments of membrane fuel cell systems. As membrane fuel cells mature in the commercial mass market, more global energy needs will be served by renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly sources of power.  DuPont Company  Nalco Fuel Tech NOxOUT Process Nalco Fuel Tech develops and markets air pollution control technologies worldwide. Nalco Fuel Tech's flagship technology, NOxOUT, reduces harmful nitric oxide emissions of stationary combustion sources to yield nitrogen gas and water, leaving no disposal solids. The NOxOUT process meets today's environmental challenges by using less toxic chemistry, reducing or eliminating toxic releases to the environment, converting wastes to more environmentally acceptable discharges, and reducing energy consumption. The NOxOUT process provides an economical solution for complying with the stringent regulatory requirements for NOx reduction from fuel combustion sources. NOxOUT can reduce NOx emissions by 75 percent, compared to the 20 to 50 percent reduction from existing treatment. The NOxOUT process is being used commercially. It can be used on new combustion units for small industrial units to large utility installations or it can be retrofitted to existing units. The environmental benefits are significant NOx reduction, elimination of byproduct disposal, toxic use elimination of SARA Title III chemicals, and increased energy efficiency.  Nalco Fuel Tech  Nalco TRASAR Technolog y Nalco's TRASAR Technology is impacting the way the world manages water by helping customers reduce pollution at its source and conserve energy. These applications are a complete cradle-to-grave approach to water management. The initial process consists of adding low levels of inert fluorescent `trace' to Nalco's products. The trace allows controlled chemical application instantaneously and automatically. Chemical treatment reductions of 20 to 30 percent have resulted from this process. The second stage of the process consists of the direct, automatic detection of the treatment chemical. By fluorescent tagging of the treatment chemical, users can detect the chemical's presence in systems where low-level detection was not possible. This stage allows correlation to the variations in treatment consumption and to the variations in the water system's operation. The processes' final stage is based on the desired performance, such as corrosion protection or 29  Nalco Chemical Company   the prevention of foaming in the process system. Monitoring of the desired performance allows further chemical adjustment. This technology allows less consumption and more effective use of industrial process water, reduced chemical usage, energy conservation, the measurement of the fate of the chemical additives, the detection of industrial and biocide treatment for enhanced risk management, and the minimization of environmental release.  Nalco Chemical Company  Nalco ULTIMERTM Polymer Technolog y Industrial processes require water as a raw material or processing aid. This water must be treated to remove harmful waste and contamination prior to discharge to the environment. High molecular weight, water soluble polymers are used to accomplish the solid/liquid separation in industrial water and waste treatment applications. A class of polymers, known as polyacrylamides, performs this separation. In 1996, shipments of polyacrylamides in the United States exceeded 200 million pounds. The worldwide market is $1 billion. In 1995, Nalco continued its technological innovation by introducing to the marketplace the first major innovation in water treatment flocculants since the development of inverse emulsion polymers. These new ULTIMERTM polymers of high molecular weight polyacrylamides are environmentally responsible since they eliminate oils and surfactants yielding oil-free sludge. ULTIMERTM polymers contribute nearly zero volatile organic content as compared to oil emulsion polymers. This technology is more effective than existing technology and eliminates potential human health and environmental hazards in worldwide use. Toxic use reduction and pollution prevention are achieved by eliminating environmental discharges that present environmental hazards and by reducing the amount of solid waste disposed to landfills.  Rohm and Haas Company  A New Chemical Family of Insecticides Exemplified by CONFIRMTM Selective Caterpillar Control Agent and the Related Selective Insect Control Agents MACH 2TM and INTREPIDTM The value of crops destroyed worldwide by insects exceeds tens of billions of dollars. Over the past 50 years, only a handful of classes of insecticides have been discovered to combat this destruction. Rohm and Haas Company's invention of a new class of chemistry, the diacylhydrazines, is a significant new addition to the tools available to growers. Three members of this family have been or are in the process of being commercialized to date: CONFIRMTM, MACH 2TM, and INTREPIDTM. Not only are these materials effective in controlling target pests, but, in addition, they present the grower with significantly safer alternatives than those currently available. EPA recognized these unique features by classifying the first two members of this family as reduced risk pesticides. CONFIRMTM is a breakthrough in caterpillar control. It is chemically, biologically, and mechanistically novel. It effectively and selectively controls important caterpillar pests in agriculture without posing significant risk to the applicator, the consumer, or the ecosystem. It will replace many older, less effective, more hazardous insecticides. MACH 2TM is chemically and mechanistically related to CONFIRMTM, but, unlike CONFIRMTM, it is used to control an entirely different type of insect in an entirely different setting, namely turf grubs in soil. MACH 2TM is a low use rate product that is substantially safer to humans and to nontarget organisms (e.g., earthworms, birds, and fish) than other currently employed turf and lawn insecticides. INTREPIDTM is the newest member of the diacylhydrazine class. It shares all the desirable attributes of CONFIRMTM (i.e., extraordinary caterpillar selectivity as well as excellent safety to humans, nontarget organisms, and the ecosystem) and has the additional advantage of significantly greater caterpillar potency, which translates into a wider range of use. 30   A New Process for the Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals In an effort to reduce the amount of waste generated at its East Hanover site, Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation has evaluated all site processes in order to make improvements in the utilization of solvents and minimize the waste byproduct while also improving operating efficiency. One process in particular was identified that appeared to offer significant opportunities for such process restructuring. After 2 years of research, all the essential elements of the new process have now been demonstrated. The new process uses a single new solvent for both reaction medium and separation, which significantly reduces the overall solvent requirements and permits recycling of the used solvent by simple distillation. As a result, the process waste index is reduced from the current 17.5 pounds of waste generated per pound of product to 1.5 pounds, resulting in a projected reduction of 170,000 pounds per year in waste generation. Furthermore, the amount of solvent used per batch is cut in half, thereby significantly reducing the usage of solvent with attendant lower risks of worker exposure and accidental releases to the environment. The decision to proceed with development of a new process, despite the potential problem of obtaining FDA approval of the process changes, is due primarily to the favorable economics of the new process. Conservative estimates of annual savings are around $775,000, compared to an investment of $2.1 million to develop and implement the new process, which is equivalent to a return on investment of 36.7 percent and less than a 3 year pay-back time. It is estimated that over 75 percent of the manufacturing savings are due to process improvements rather than disposal costs of unused solvent, illustrating the process optimization benefits characteristic for pollution prevention innovations.  Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation  No-Clean Soldering CTS Corporation Resistor Networks produces solid ceramic resistor networks in various single in-line, dual in-line, surface mount, and through-hole packages with standard or custom circuit designs. Through CTS Corporation's commitment to a responsible environmental policy, many of its manufacturing methods have been modified with the goal of reducing or eliminating hazardous waste byproducts. One such method to reduce waste was the implementation of a No-Clean soldering process. This No-Clean soldering process, which began in March of 1993, has eliminated the use of wave oil, soldering fluxes, and solvent cleaning. Changing to the No-Clean soldering process involved installing hoods over the solder pots. Using the hoods, an inert atmosphere is maintained over the molten solder. By using the inert atmosphere, oil and flux are no longer required. The parts are clean after solder and thus no solvent cleaning is needed. Previously, TCA (1-1-1 Trichloroethane) and TCE (1,1,2 Trichloroethylene) were used as part of a post-solder cleaning operation to remove flux and wave oil residues. Due to the elimination of flux and wave oil, these cleaning operations became unnecessary. Therefore, the amounts of waste TCA and TCE from soldering operations were reduced from 9,900 pounds and 226,000 pounds in 1992, respectively, to zero in 1995. As an added benefit of eliminating solventbased cleaning operations, air emissions due to the use of these chemicals have dramatically decreased. From 1992 through 1995, TCA and TCE related air emissions from soldering operations have been reduced from 99,000 pounds and 250,000 pounds, respectively, to zero. A cleaning operation, not related to soldering, generated a small amount of TCE air emissions in 1995. This operation was eliminated in June of 1995. The No-Clean soldering process has eliminated the generation of waste oil, flux, and cleaning solvents at the solder operation. Workers are no longer exposed to fumes from fluxes, oils, and cleaning solvents, which are typical of soldering operations. The product quality also has been improved.  CTS Corporation Resistor Networks  31   Technic, Inc. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  Noncyanide Silver Electroplating A proprietary, noncyanide silver electroplating process, Techni-Silver Cy-Less L, was developed by Technic. Cyanide based processes for electroplating have been extensively used in the United States for the last 50 years. Due to the hazardous nature of cyanide, extensive safety precautions must be incorporated when manufacturing electroplating chemicals, transporting the solutions to user sites, using the electroplating process, and disposing waste solutions. For example, if cyanide based solutions become too acidic, large amounts of poisonous cyanide gas are created. Historically, the electroplating industry has suffered many accidents due to the use of cyanide, which on a few occasions have resulted in death. Alternatives to cyanide-based solutions had been developed for all metals commercially electroplated except silver. The noncyanide silver electroplating process developed by Technic provides an alternative that is noticeably less toxic than the cyanide process and inherently safer with regard to accident potential. In addition, tests clearly show that the noncyanide formulation is capable of producing sound, thick (i.e., around 125 m) silver deposits that are extremely fine-grained and exhibit properties comparable to those produced in silver cyanide formulations. With the success of the noncyanide chemistry, Technic has made it possible to operate an entire plating facility without having to use any cyanide compounds.  DuPont Films  Petretecsm Polyester Regeneration Technolog y Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the fastest growing polymer. Becuase of their inherent thermal stability, PET-type thermoplastics lend themselves to direct recycling and serve as a raw material for the production of a number of products. For example, the success of PET bottle recycling is well known. This process annually diverts more than 600 million pounds of PET bottles per year from landfills. This technology requires waste with a high purity content and can only be used for carpeting or pillows. It usually cannot be reused to make new bottles. Additionally, there are a large number of uses for PET in which the material is dyed, coated, or mixed with a copolymer. The bulk of these materials are not suitable for direct recycling, so they are typically landfilled. However, the patented DuPont Petretecsm polyester regeneration technology provides an environmental alternative to landfills. The DuPont Petretecsm process unzips the PET molecule and breaks it down into its raw materials, dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG). The process allows the monomers to retain their original properties so they can be reused over and over again in any first-quality application. The process accepts polyester with a variety of contaminants at higher levels than other processes. The process reduces dependence on oil-derived feedstocks and diverts polyester from the solid waste stream. In the Petretecsm process, scrap PET reacts with methanol vapor at an elevated temperature (i.e., greater than 260 C) to produce a vapor stream of DMT, EG, and excess methanol. A glycol azeotroping agent, methyl p-toluate (MPT), is added, and the components are separated. Purification is accomplished by extensive fractional vacuum distillation. The products are then shipped back to PET fiber, film, and resin producers. Each kilogram of DMT made by the Petretecsm process reduces the demand for about 0.5 Kg of the traditional raw material known as paraxylene, an oil-derived basic petrochemical. The Petretecsm process is FDA approved and provides an economical way to reuse materials with higher contaminant levels than other recycling methods. DuPont converted its Cape Fear facility, near Wilmington, North Carolina, to a methanolysis plant. The new plant can handle more than 100 million pounds of scrap PET and 30 million pounds of EG annually, and is easily expandable.  32   Polycarbonate/Polydimethylsiloxane Copolymers for Thermal Print Media The process to make polycarbonates using bischloroformates and bisphenols or diols was developed and commercialized in the early 1990s by the Polymer Products Unit of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York. The original process to produce the polycarbonate of bisphenol A, diethylene glycol, and bisaminopropyl polydimethyl-siloxane was developed in 1992 and commercialized in 1993 for use in a new thermal print media product. Concerns over waste and air emissions, as well as cost and capacity issues, prompted a research and development effort to replace this polymer before production volumes increased to forecasted high levels. The new process to produce a similar polycarbonate/polydimethylsiloxane copolymer was certified early in 1994. Improvements include the following: (1) the new process is made in the solvent in which the polymer is coated, and is delivered to the manufacturing department dissolved in that solvent, eliminating the methanol precipitation, methanol washing, and vacuum drying steps; (2) in the new process, triethylamine is used as the acid acceptor instead of pyridine, making the water wash waste streams less hazardous; (3) the new process uses the commercially available diethylene glycol bischloroformate, eliminating the need to manufacture the bisphenol A bischloroformate at Kodak in Rochester (the bisphenol A bischloroformate synthesis uses phosgene as a key reactant, and its purification produces large quantities of hazardous waste containing heptane and silica gel). The new process will yield over 1.2 million pounds of hazardous waste reductions and more than 3,000 pounds of air emissions reductions from 1994 to year end 1996.  Eastman Kodak Company  PORTA-FEED Advanced Chemical Handling Systems During the 1980s, disposal of chemical residues and their containers was a potential human health and environmental risk for chemical users and the public. In 1985, Nalco developed the PORTA-FEED Advanced Chemical Handling system for chemical applications worldwide. It is the largest private fleet of returnable containers in the world at a capital cost of $220 million. These 101,000 units are owned, monitored, maintained, and cleaned by Nalco as a cradle-to-grave risk management process. The program consists of the units, a computerized tracking system, a zero defect delivery system, and a systematic maintenance and cleaning program. This pollution prevention program has prevented the disposal of more than 3 million drums and 30 million pounds of chemical waste. In 1985, 33 percent of Nalco's annual sales of $659 million were shipped in 500,000 nonreturnable drums. Seven percent of 1995 annual sales of $1.2 billion were shipped in nonreturnable drums. By the year 2000, Nalco expects to have eliminated the disposal concerns from 10 million drums and 100 million pounds of chemical waste worldwide. The system benefits are the reduction of human and environmental risk from transportation to disposal, reduced chemical inventory, and renewable resource implementation.  Nalco Chemical Company  The Production of Cumene with Zeolite Catalyst: Mobil/Badger Cumene Process Cumene is manufactured in very large volumes for subsequent conversion to phenol and acetone. The existing worldwide demand for cumene is about 7 million metric tons per year. The production of cumene by alkylation of benzene with propylene has, in the past, been carried out commercially over two catalyst systems: solid phosphoric acid (SPA) or aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Both SPA and AlCl3 present severe environmental problems; SPA catalyst is wet, corrosive, and might contain hydrocarbons, while waste AlCl3 is 33  Mobil Technology Company   a corrosive liquor that also might contain hydrocarbons. Both are classified as hazardous wastes. The Mobil/Badger Cumene process uses a new zeolite catalyst developed by Mobil, tested by Badger, and first commercialized in 1996. The environmental features of this process are many. The catalyst is environmentally inert, requires no special packaging or handling, and can be returned to Mobil at the end of its useful life. Very high yields are achieved; this results in less byproducts and waste streams and in reduced consumption of raw materials. Byproducts are LPG and a small residue stream useful as a high value fuel; neither presents an environmental hazard. High product purity results in improved yield and greater throughput in downstream phenol units, with lower production of byproducts and waste streams. Lower consumption of utilities leads to environmental improvement in their generation. Existing cumene facilities can, with retrofit, derive the environmental benefits of a new facility. By the middle of 1998, approximately 85 percent of the demand for cumene in the United States will be met by new and upgraded facilities using this technology.  DuPont Company  Reduction of Carbon Tetrachloride Emissions at the Source by the Development of a New Catalyst Phosgene is an important intermediate in the synthesis of polycarbonate plastics, high performance polymers, agrichemical intermediates, and urethane foams. Current global production is about 10 billion pounds per year. Although the process chemistry is selective, the byproduct carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is generated at a rate of 300 to 500 ppm, amounting to 5 million pounds per year globally. Since carbon tetrachloride is a carcinogen, an ozone depleting chemical, and a greenhouse gas, it was desirable to reduce or eliminate this undesirable byproduct. A DuPont team discovered a new catalyst that was produced in Siberia, Russia. After much laboratory work, it was decided to try a plant test, a scaleup of greater than 250,000 times. The catalyst was purchased, shipped from Siberia, and implemented in less than 1 year after the start of the program. After 1.5 years of commercial production, the new catalyst has consistently demonstrated high phosgene production rates and achieved a 90 percent reduction in the level of carbon tetrachloride generation (i.e., to less than 50 ppm, apparently a new global record). By conceptualizing, identifying, testing, securing from Russia, and implementing a novel phosgene production catalyst (well within the proposed 18 month deadline), the team saved the business a cost of $2 million associated with the installation of a new abatement furnace, which would have been the only other alternative. Furthermore, the resulting need for fewer catalyst changes in the reactor, as well as the prevention of maintenance costs that would have been associated with the abatement furnace, will save approximately an additional $400,000 per year. The catalyst technology is being offered for license globally, which could reduce emissions of CCl4 by up to 5 million pounds per year.  Monsanto Company  Roundup ReadyTM Technolog y Roundup ReadyTM technology is the mechanism by which crop selectivity to Roundup herbicide has been introduced into crop plants. Roundup, the world's largest selling herbicide, controls almost all weeds but shows little selectivity in crops. Roundup has excellent environmental characteristics and the active ingredient of glyphosphate has been given a category E status (evidence for not being a carcinogen) by EPA. The mode of action of the herbicide is also known precisely. A set of unique genes (Roundup ReadyTM) were discovered and introduced into crop plants to protect them from damage by the herbicide. Commercial launch began in 1996 with soybeans in the United States and will be followed by cotton and corn in 1997 to 1998. Current research and development programs will soon thereafter lead to commercialization in other oilseed crops, such as rape seed, and 34   in sugarbeet. Additional potential applications include wheat, rice, forestry, and vegetable and salad crops. Roundup ReadyTM Technology has changed the spectrum of herbicides used. Farmers who planted Roundup ReadyTM soybeans in 1996 reduced herbicide use by 10 to 35 percent with better weed control and generally did not use a preemergent or residual, post-emergent herbicide. Roundup herbicide has no `carry-over' in the soil, does not limit crop rotations, and is compatible with no-till crop production (a practice that is expanding in the United States and elsewhere). This technology extends to a wider aspect of agriculture and food production the ability to use one of the most beneficial and environmentally benign farm chemicals ever discovered.  Solvent Replacement and Improved Selectivity in Asymmetric Catalysis Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a substitute for organic solvents already represents an important tool for waste reduction in the chemical industry and related areas. Coffee decaffeination, hops extraction, and essential oil production as well as waste extraction/recycling, and a number of analytical procedures already use this nontoxic, nonflammable, renewable, and inexpensive compound as a solvent. The extension of this approach to chemical production, using CO2 as a reaction medium, is a promising approach to pollution prevention. Of the wide range supercritical carbon dioxide reactions that have been explored, one class of reactions has shown exceptional promise. Los Alamos National Laboratory has found that asymmetric catalytic reductions, particularly hydrogenations and hydrogen transfer reactions, can be carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide with selectivities comparable or superior to those observed in conventional organic solvents. Los Alamos has discovered, for example, that asymmetric hydrogen transfer reduction of enamides using ruthenium catalysts proceeds with enantioselectivities that exceed those in conventional solvents. The success of asymmetric catalytic reductions in CO2 is due in part to several unique properties of CO2 including tuneable solvent strength, gas miscibility, high diffusivity, and ease of separation. In addition, the insolubility of salts, a significant limitation of CO2 as a reaction solvent, has been overcome by using lipophilic anions, particularly tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate. These discoveries demonstrate an environmentally benign and potentially economically viable alternative for the synthesis of a wide range of specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  Los Alamos National Laboratory  Splittable Surfactants, A New Class of Surfactants Developed by Union Carbide Corporation Union Carbide has developed a new class of surfactants, `Splittable Surfactants,' that will provide a substantial reduction in emulsified organics discharged in wastewater streams generated by a wide variety of industries. The new surfactants exhibit superior end use performance, as compared to current waste treatable surfactants and other proposed treatment schemes, which have not gained widespread use due to limitations in performance. Waste streams containing Union Carbide's `Splittable Surfactants' are quickly, easily, thoroughly, and irreversibly `split' and deactivated, via a chemical trigger, into nonsurface active components, allowing separation of the oily waste components from the water stream. A more concentrated oily waste is generated, facilitating incineration for fuel value and a highly biodegradable, essentially nontoxic water stream is discharged to treatment facilities. Before splitting and deactivation, `Splittable Surfactants' have an environmental profile comparable to conventional nonionic surfactants. Upon deactivation, both the hydrophilic 35  Union Carbide Corporation   and hydrophobic components biodegrade rapidly; the hydrophilic component that remains in the wastewater is essentially nontoxic to aquatic life. The Splittable Surfactant technology is the focus of the first industry partnership under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Technology Initiative for Chemicals.  Stepan Company  Stepan Company PA Lites Polyester Polyol Stepan Company's Polyester Polyol product, manufactured using the Phthalic Anhydride Process Light Ends (PA Lites), uses a previously categorized waste as a raw material in its manufacture, thereby eliminating the material's disposal via incineration. This Polyester Polyol is the basic raw material for the manufacture of various types of insulating wallboard used in the home construction and commercial building industry. By substituting traditional raw materials with PA Lites, Stepan Company is providing the construction industry and consumer with a cost effective alternative to traditional building construction products. Benefits from this product substitution go beyond the elimination of a waste requiring disposal. With its substitution as a raw material, it has reduced the requirement for phtalic anhydride, the traditional raw material for the polyol product, and the air emissions associated with its manufacture. As part of the development of this process, the distillation operation in the phtalic anhydride facility was also improved. An estimated 350 tons per year of organic waste material has been eliminated with the development and implementation of this technology. This not only represents a significant reduction in waste requiring disposal by incineration, but also the air emissions associated with these processes. Since this previously categorized waste material is now used on site to produce Polyester Polyol, potential exposure to the general public during offsite transportation to disposal facilities has been eliminated. This project resulted in two economic benefits. The first is the savings associated with the transportation and disposal via fuel blending for energy recovery. On an annual basis the expected savings is $200,000. The second economic benefit is the raw material savings due to the replacement of the Pure PA with the PA Lites material on a pound for pound basis. This results in additional savings of $20,000 annually.  Stepan Company  STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Polyurethane Foam HCFC-Free, Environmentally Friendly, Rigid Polyurethane Foam STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Polyurethane Foam is a product that replaces CFCs and HCFCs with water as the blowing agent in rigid polyurethane foam. Due to its unique and innovative chemistry, U.S. patent applications are pending for this product. Rigid polyurethane foam is a plastic material that provides a unique combination of insulation value and structural rigidity for common products such as picnic coolers, entry doors, and water heaters. Historically, polyurethane foams used in insulating applications incorporated trichlorofluoroethane (CFC-11) as the blowing agent. However, CFCs, such as trichlorofluoroethane, have been demonstrated to play a large role in the chemical destruction of Earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which acts as a filter for harmful ultraviolet radiation. Today, most polyurethane foams have replaced trichlorofluoroethane with HCFC-141b as the blowing agent. Although it has an ozone depletion potential that is lower than that of CFC-11, HCFC-141b is also considered an ozone-depleter. The Stepan Company has remained committed to addressing these issues through the development of a lower cost, technologically advanced polyurethane foam, which replaces environmentally unfriendly and potentially hazardous blowing agents with water. STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Foam eliminates emissions of CFCs and HCFCs into the environment; it 36   ultimately reduces the mass of solid waste requiring disposal, and it offers a safer alternative blowing agent than other technologies are currently offering. The final, and perhaps most important, property considered in the development of STEPANFOAM WaterBlown Foam as an alternative to HCFC-blown products is its insulative capacity. Outstanding flow characteristics, combined with a fine cellular structure, maximize the insulation capability of STEPANFOAM Water-Blown Foam. At the same core density, the physical properties of the two systems are nearly identical. By replacing CFC and HCFC with water in its formulations, Stephan has eliminated its use of as much as 2 million pounds per year of CFCs and will eliminate as much as 1 million pounds per year of HCFCs.  Synerg y CCSTM Precision Cleaning Solvent: A Government/Industry Solution to a Complex Environmental Problem Synergy CCSTM had its beginnings at the Department of Energy's Kansas City Plant (managed and operated by AlliedSignal Inc.) when the plant began an effort focused on the elimination of toxic, restricted, or environmentally damaging solvents. Experience derived from this solvent substitution and elimination effort proved beneficial when, through its Technology Transfer Program, Kansas City Plant personnel were asked for help by a small manufacturer needing a safe, one-step cleaning solvent. Synergy CCSTM Precision Cleaning Agent was formulated to meet this need. Synergy CCSTM is a blend of environmentally derived products that forms a safe, powerful, yet distillable precision cleaning solvent capable of being heavily loaded with contaminants. Synergy CCSTM is comprised of natural components that have been in industrial use for over 45 years: dlimoene, a solvent derived from citrus byproducts, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, a solvent produced from the waste products of corn, oats, and sugar production. Individually, these materials are already used for cleaners, paint stripping formulations, and agricultural applications. The solvent was further developed and adopted by a HewlettPackard Co. division, patented, and licensed to Petroferm, Inc., a worldwide leader in sales and technical support for alternative solvents and cleaning technologies. This partnership demonstrates how government and private industry can work together to develop safe chemical alternatives to solve environmental problems while simultaneously improving America's industrial competitiveness.  Allied Signal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies  Use of Carbon Dioxide as an Alternative Green Solvent for the Synthesis of Energetic Thermoplastic Elastomers Thermoplastic elastomers based on triblock oxetane copolymers containing azido functional groups offer an improved binding material for solid, high-energy formulations. Current technology uses chemically cross-linked energetic prepolymer mixes that introduce the problems of thermally labile chemical linkages, high end-of-mix viscosities, and vulnerability to premature detonation. These materials are also nonrecyclable and generate large amounts of pollution during disposal. The use of energetic thermoplastic elastomers eliminates the need for chemical cross-linking agents, makes processing easier due to their low melt viscosities, and eliminates the need for solvents during casting. Their superior processing qualities and the ease of demilitarization and recycling make these materials a much more environmentally sound choice for energetic binders. However, their synthesis still involves the use of large quantities of toxic chemicals, such as methylene chloride, as solvents. Carbon dioxide has been proven to be a viable, environmentally responsible replacement solvent for many synthetic and processing applications. It is cheap, easily recy37  U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research U.S. Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center Aerojet Propulsion Professor Joseph M. DeSimone, Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill   clable, and available from current sources. Research at the University of North Carolina has shown that carbon dioxide is a viable solvent for the polymerization of vinyl ether monomers. Furthermore, polyoxetanes can be polymerized in carbon dioxide with molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and functionality maintained. The University of North Carolina has demonstrated the synthesis of both nonenergetic and energetic homopolymers and random copolymers.  Alliance for Environmental Technology (AET)  The Use of Chloride Oxide, the Foundation of Elemental Chlorine-Free (ECF) Bleaching for Pulp and Paper, as a Pollution Prevention Process The use of chlorine dioxide as a pollution prevention process to substantially or completely replace chlorine in the first stage of chemical pulp bleaching is a unique implementation of chlorine dioxide chemistry. It can be applied to the entire bleached chemical pulp and paper industry, both in the United States and abroad. By employing raw material substitution and process modifications, this technology has allowed the pulp and paper industry to meet the source reduction objectives of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. With this new application of sophisticated chlorine dioxide chemistry, the pulp and paper industry virtually eliminated dioxin from mill waste waters and our nation's water bodies. This technology has answered the industry's calls for a more benign chemical pulp bleaching agent. Virtual elimination of dioxin from mill waste waters and continuing nationwide ecosystem recovery provide a strong measure of chlorine dioxide's success and the industry's environmental progress. In fact, downstream of U.S. pulp mills bleaching with chlorine dioxide, fish dioxin body burdens have declined rapidly and aquatic ecosystems continue to recover. For example, the Mead Paper Company's Escanaba Mill, in Michigan, implemented pollution prevention strategies beginning with the use of low precursor defoamers in 1989. In 1990, the mill increased chlorine dioxide substitution. These process modifications decreased dioxin in final mill effluent to nondetectable levels. Consequently, dioxin body burdens declined more than 90 percent in less than 4 years. These indicators of progress toward broader ecosystem integrity demonstrate the success of chlorine dioxide as `green chemistry.'  U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research U.S. Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center Los Alamos National Laboratory Aerojet  Waste Reduction in the Production of an Energetic Material by Development of an Alternative Synthesis 1,3,3-Trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) is a promising new melt-castable explosive that has significant potential for providing environmental benefits and capability improvements in a wide variety of defense and industrial applications. Initial lifecycle inventories on various munitions revealed that up to 50 percent of the lifecycle pollution burden was associated with the demilitarization of the munitions, and in particular, the use of thermoset polymeric binders that require removal with water jet cutting. TNAZ is the only energetic material other than trinitrotoluene (TNT) that can be melt-cast in existing TNT loading plants. Demilitarization of TNAZ simply requires heating the device above the melting point and pouring the liquid out, rather than the complicated and destructive methods used for RDX- and HMX-based plastic-bonded explosives. The stability of TNAZ in the melt allows it to be easily recycled. TNAZ has performance slightly better than that of HMX, the most powerful military explosive in current use. Thus, TNAZ may offer 30 to 40 percent improvements in performance as a replacement for TNT-based formulations such as Composition-B. The alternative synthesis of TNAZ, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, allows TNAZ to be produced in a waste-free process that also eliminates the use of halogenated solvents. This alternative synthesis produces 5.3 pounds of 38   waste per pound of product compared to the original synthesis of TNAZ, which produces 1,200 pounds of waste per pound of product. The alternate technology has been transferred to industry, where it has been scaled up to production-plant quantities. Further improvements in waste reduction have been demonstrated in the laboratory that may eventually lead to a process giving little more waste than one pound of salt per pound of TNAZ.  Water-Dispersible Hot-Melt Adhesive Raw Material Current technologies make recycling and disposal of paper products difficult. The hotmelt adhesive industry has been searching for an answer in the form of a water-dispersible raw material. Previous attempts to satisfy this need were often deficient in both critical performance requirements and cost. Government regulations are not yet directly mandating improved adhesive raw materials, but the needs are real and urgent just the same. The lack of regulatory changes does not encourage adhesive manufacturers to introduce products based on expensive raw materials. Eastman AQ 1350 water-dispersible hot-melt adhesive raw material represents the best of both worlds. The water dispersibility of Eastman AQ 1350 is due to the random incorporation of sodiosulfonate groups along with polymer backbone. These ionic functionalities also facilitate the excellent adhesion of Eastman AQ 1350 to a variety of substrates. Some of the key features of Eastman's new product are low cost, 100 percent water-dispersible in ordinary tap water, nondispersible in ionic solutions, superior adhesion to polyolefin films, and comparable key physical properties to conventional formulations. Eastman AQ 1350 is part of a new family of water-dispersible polymers that provide the hot-melt adhesive industry with an innovation that addresses long-standing needs in very large, applicable areas. These products not only overcome the lack of water-dispersibility inherent to the current generation of technology but also are differentiated from the competitive generation of technologies by their ability to be dispersed into water coupled with insolubility in saline solutions. This tunable solubility mechanism also can be employed as a method for product recovery; thus, it is legitimate to call Eastman AQ 1350 an advanced technology of a `smart material.'  Eastman Chemical Company  West Fork Biotreatment Project Asarco has developed a biotreatment system for removing metals from mine water prior to its discharge to the waters of the state. Asarco owns and operates two lead mines and a lead smelter and refinery in southeast Missouri. Recent changes in the Water Quality Standards required Asarco to explore water treatment alternatives. One of the alternatives considered was biotreatment. Preliminary results from a tank test and proof-of-principle test conducted in 1993, were very encouraging and plans were made for a scale size operation to be built. In early 1994 a pilot plant biocell was constructed and filled with a substrate mixture of sawdust from an abandoned sawmill, alfalfa hay, cow manure from a dairy, mine tailings, and lime rock. All material used was acquired locally. Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) were cultivated within the anaerobic environment of the substrate. SRB are abundant in nature and are found predominantly in bogs and swamps. The SRB produce hydrogen sulfide gas as a byproduct that acts as a sulfiding agent to precipitate the dissolved metals from the mine water. The system also removes significant amounts of nitrates. The pilot plant reduced metals to below the Water Quality Standards set by the State of Missouri for protection of aquatic life. Different operation scenarios were implemented to explore the limits of the system. For 2 years, through extremes of ambient temperature, water flow rates, and metals loadings, the biotreatment system operated efficiently. The system reverses the process which put the lead in the dissolved form and returns it to a lead sulfide (PbS), an original inert form of lead ore. The PbS remains in the substrate for the life of the plant which is estimated, based on carbon consumption, to be in excess of 30 39  Asarco Incorporated   years. No chemicals were used, therefore, no chemicals must be transported on highways at risk of spilling. No daily sludges are generated that have to be disposed of in landfills, and water quality is improved. Construction of a full-scale plant was completed in July 1996. Start-up was completed in November and the full-scale plant is currently treating 1,500 GPM and is allowing West Fork Mine to comply with the NPDES permit limits.  40   Index Award winners are indicated with *. *Albright & Wilson Americas  THPS Biocides: A New Class of Antimicrobial Chemistry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Alliance for Environmental Technology (AET)  The Use of Chlorine Oxide, the Foundation of Elemental Chlorine-Free (ECF) Bleaching for Pulp and Paper, as a Pollution Prevention Process . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 Allied Signal Federal Manufacturing and Technologies  Synerg y CCSTM Precision Cleaning Solvent: A Government/Industry Solution to a Complex Environmental Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37 Altus Biologics Inc.

GX267-89-4895943	"simulations suggest that such a scheme can control exhaustion of dyes in a multiple component dyebath. Our current dyeing equipment has been modified to allow dosing of dyes and/or chemicals into the dyebath using a computer-controlled peristaltic pump. The software necessary to drive the pump was written and tested. The first system to be examined involving dosing to control the dyeing process is the dyeing of polyamide fibers with acid dyes. In addition, a new generation data acquisition system, based on industry standards, is under development, and should be online by November. This system should greatly enhance our ability to acquire and store dye-bath data. Additionally, the following hardware was purchased: 80486 based PC to control a UV-Visible spectrophotometer, a computer controllable piston pump, and a pH meter which is temperature and conductivity compensated. Technical Papers and Other Communications  Synthetic Dyes Based on Toxicological Considerations Principal Investigator: s92c2  H. S. Freeman (NC State) Objectives:  The goals outlined in the 3-year study proposed last year remain essentially intact. They are: 1) Characterization of the mechanisms of genotoxicity of hydrophobic azo dyes; 2) Synthesis and evaluation of novel metalized acid, direct, and fiber-reactive dyes; 3) Environmentally safe routes to azo dyes based on heteroaromatic amines; 4) Synthesis of azo dyes from the wastes of other reactions; 5) Improvements in the yields of coupling components for disperse dyes; and 6) Well-trained dye chemists. In addition, we intend to pursue the development of a patent application to protect the novel, lightfast black metal (Fe) complexes discovered so far in this investigation. Since the dyes developed to this point appear to be more appropriate for wool than nylon, ""environmentally friendly"" metal complexes for nylon will also be designed. The novel Fe complexes already made will also be evaluated on leather, to follow through on a suggestion by Mr. Abe Riefe (industrialist on this project). Summary:  The following papers have been submitted, presented or published during this reporting quarter to add to the numerous publications and presentations from previous quarters: l W. Jasper, E.

It is clear from the reports we received so far that perspiration fastness was good and lightfastness was especially good. Of concern was the low water solubility of the dyes and their fastness/stability to acidic media. Interestingly, both dyes continue to be of Natimal Textile Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993   interest, as one seems preferable on nylon while the other is better on leather. In the meantime, we have synthesized an analog of these dyes that possesses improved water solubility, and will be evaluating its fastness properties soon. In recent weeks, we elected to turn our attention to a family of less commonly used complex-forming monoazo dyes as targets for the synthesis of new I:2 Iron complexes. The result has been the formation of blue and violet colors for nylon and wool, in addition to brown and black shades. Needless to say, this is an exciting and quite promising turn of events. We are planning to synthesize a group of mixed complexes, with the goal of fine tuning some of the present shades. Obviously, the next step is to assess the fastness properties of this new family of dyes. The results of this determination will be outlined in our next report. Preliminary results from the mutagenicity testing of the metallized dyes prepared so far indicate that the Fe complexes are either non-mutagenic or significantly less mutagenic than both the corresponding Co and Cr analogs and the unmetallized precursors. Laura will have more definitive results for the next report.

Moser, B. Smith (NC State); W. Perkins (Auburn) [reported by Mike Cato] Objective:  1. Characterize basic dielectric infrared and ultrasound properties of textile material for a database to be used to develop these energy sources in fiber, textile, and apparel manufacturing. 2. Develop textile processing utilizing electrotechnologies for improvement in productivity and environmental safety; includes IR absorption studies; dielectric properties studies; RF fixation mechanisms; and ultrasonic dyeing. 3. Develop economic analysis of existing energy intensive manufacturing technologies; expansion of existing energy models to include economic analysis; develop non-traditional economic models (multiattribute decision) of electrotechnologies. 4. Develop new processing techniques such as an accelerated process for dyeing short runs of polyester/cotton fabric. Develop a process to quickly and economically dye short runs of polyester/cotton blend fabrics; process based on radio frequency energy. 5. Develop entirely new processes using combinations of electrotechnologies such as ultrasonic dyeing and RF drying. Summary:  We completed our investigation of the utility of FeCl, as a coagulant for the removal of phosphate ions from disperse dye wastewater. Using filtrates derived from the synthesis of Disperse Red 177, we found that phosphate removal at a level of 99.999+% can be achieved when an Fe:P ratio of 2: 1 is used. This means that either Alum or FeCl, can be used as long as the proper pH is employed. For Alum the pH should be 5-6, and for the pH should be 3-4. In the coming months we will conclude the present aspect of our work in this area with a determination of the utility of the collected phosphate as a component for commercial fertilizers. This is envisioned as an alternative to either incineration or landfilling the coagulants. Technical Papers and Other Communications  A manuscript entitled ""Premetallized Acid Dyes Based on Environmental Considerations"" has been prepared for the Book of Papers for the upcoming AATCC International Conference (October, 1993). This paper outlines the results to be presented during the conference delivery, and focuses on the fastness properties and genotoxicity of the black Fe complexes synthesized as potential non-chromium alternatives to commercial premetallized acid black dyes containing Cr. The manuscript mentioned in our last report as having been submitted to Textile Research Journal has been reviewed, and was found acceptable pending our consideration of 3 points. These were handled by us immediately, and the editor has sent the revised manuscript to the reviewer for final consideration.  Joint research involving all three universities is being done to determine the effects of washing efficiency on dielectric properties and RF drying of yarn packages. Warren Perkins has determined common residuals in bleached and dyed yarn packages. With Warren's recommendations, experiments are being designed and conducted at Georgia Tech using a network analyzer which measures the dielectric properties of materials. Different solutions typically found in textile dyeing have been prepared and analyzed to determine their dielectric properties. Different types of salt had significantly different loss factors. Data is being analyzed and a final report will be compiled within two months. NC State is planning to use the information learned at Georgia Tech to design pilot plant drying studies. To better understand the network analyzer, Mike Cato, from NC State, worked at Georgia Tech for a day.  National Textib Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993  23"

Analysis is now in progress on the toxicity of these three dyes after they have been decolorized by ozone. In another experiment, the toxicities of Cu"" in ionic form and Drimarene Turquoise K2B (a copper phthalocyanine type reactive dye) were determined. Toxicity tests were done on the dye before ozonation and after ozonation to various degrees of color removal. The EC,, toxicity of Cu'* for Lemna Minor was 2.8 ppm. Approximately 90 ppm of dye contains 2.8 ppm of copper. The results of the toxicity tests for the dye were as follows: Ozonation Time Light Transmittance Toxicity (Min) 0 48 80 105 (%) 50 77 95+ EC, mgn 422 103 93 89  40 20 100 120 140  0  20  40  60  60  Time of Treatment (minutes) - 1 g/l peroxids;SW-UV  Removal of Dyes Electrochemically from Reactive Dyeing Wastewater: Researchers at Georgia Tech continued studies  in this area. Removal of color by the electrochemical process has been completed for the four reactive dyes selected for study. The color removal is more rapid than expected based on work on other dye classes. Color in some cases was 100% removed at only 50 ppm of iron addition. Similar results have been obtained in three separate experiments so the rapid removal appears to be real. The electrochemical process may prove to be very efficient in removing reactive dyes. The reasons for this rapid decolorization of reactive dyes is now Reactive dyes can be re~f;~~e~.

Continuous Bleaching of Cotton Process Automation and Reuse of Bleaching Waste Water for Fabric Scouring: The laboratory filtration unit at Clemson has been assembled and the baseline data collected on tap and deionized (DI) water to determine the filtration characteristics of the microtilter. Laboratory experiments are currently being conducted at Clemson to determine the type of filtration that will be needed to make the bleaching wastewater suitable for recycle. This data will be compared to plant data taken from full scale operation. Additional samples of the bleaching and scouring wastewater continue to be taken for wastewater characterization. Bleaching formulation data continues to be gathered so it will be available if it becomes necessary to make modifications to the plant formulation to make it compatible with the conditions of the scouring process from a reuse perspective. The selection of the software for simulating the bleaching and scouring process and for modeling the recycle process is underway and should be completed during the next quarter. The engineering plans have been developed for the full scale plant scale recycling system and plans have been made for its installation early in the next quarter. In addition, the process design changes for both the Open Width Preparation Range and the Combination Open & Rope Preparation Ranges in 27  lyzer for complex dye mixtures. The computer interface has been programmed and is operational. The light source was damaged in transit and had to be returned to the manufacturer. It has been repaired and has been received. Moditications to the fiber optic cable system had to be made to interface with the dual beam flow cell. These modifications are underway. Initial evaluations on the unit are planned for next quarter. Metals Removal and Toxicity Studies-  A study was conducted to determine the toxicity of three vinyl sulfone type reactive dyes to Lemna Minor (duckweed). The results were expressed as EC,, values. The EC,, value is the concentration of dye which inhibits growth of Lemna Minor to 50% of that of controls without dye in a seven day period. The higher the EC,, value, the less toxic the material is. The following results were obtained.

Develop and evaluate dyes that require less salt for application and optimized dyeing 1 procedures for existing dyes. The initial work was proposed at a cost of over $200,000. Due to budget limitations, two of these areas, trace impurity analysis (#3) and color removal (#4), were chosen as project initiation tasks. The remaining projects were deferred until later. Summary: Decolorization of Waste Water  fort during this quarter has been directed toward understanding the differences between the commercial scale trials on hydrogen peroxide bleaching of hosiery and the laboratory experiments. Several possible sources of difference have been ruled out by subsequent experiments. Differences in water between the lab and the plant and differences in the addition of optical brightener do not appear to be the sources of the different results. Level of sodium hydroxide and temperature differences are now under investigation. A number of new surfactants have been investigated this quarter in an attempt to find a substitute for the ethoxylated phenol in the current recipe. It was surprising to find that none of the alternatives give whiteness values as high as the current surfactant. Several other candidates will be investigated next quarter as the surfactant is clearly a key ingredient in the whiteness level that is obtainable. Technical Papers and Other Communications l  A sorption unit that utilizes chitin and chitosan was built and tested in the previous quarter. This quarter considerable data was collected on a number of dyestuffs. In particular a number of studies on Acid Red 1 dye were obtained. The decolorization unit consists of four chambers that can be independently operated or with the others in series or parallel flow. Each chamber can accommodate approximately 1 liter of absorbent or approximately 100 grams of chitin. The unit has been successmlly tested up to a flow rate of 900 mL/min and pressures of up to 22 psi. Nine different dyes were tested on the sorption unit using chitosan as an adsorbent. These dyes were: Acid Red 1, Acid Blue 25, Acid Blue 193, Mordant Black 17, Direct 81, Direct Blue 86, Direct Green 26, Reactive Red 120, and Reactive Violet 5. As noted above Acid Red 1 was used for a number of different studies, For all of the above isotherms were obtained. A monolayer capacity of Acid Red 1 dye onto chitosan was found to be as high as 242.6 g per kilogram of chitosan. A surprising result was the discovery of an ""overdyeing effect"" for Acid Red 1. Overdyeing is the unexpected sorption of ionic dyes onto a substrate beyond what is expected for a langmuir type isotherm. This unexpected feature of chitosan has not been reported before. Future studies will exploit this observation and is expected to lead to a more fundamental insight on the sorption of ionic dyes onto ionic polymers. Detection of Trace Toxic Impurities in High Volume Raw Materials  l  A paper on Decolorization of Continuous Dyeing Wastewater by Ozonation was accepted for publication by Textile Chemist and Colorist. A paper on the new hosiery bleaching system was presented at the annual Institute of Textile Technology TAC meeting in April. A Master's thesis on this system will be issued next quarter.  Wastewater Decolorization using Chitin and Detection of Trace Toxic Impurities in High Volume Raw Material Principal Investigators: SQZCl  C.D. Livengood, C. Smith, S. M. Hudson (NC State) Objectives:  Long term four major areas of work were initially proposed last year. 1. Develop a simple comparative rating system for assessing treatability of textile chemicals and waste streams. 2. Develop improved methods of identifying/reducing specific pollutant sources (e.g. textile dyes, chemicals and processes.) 3. Identify offensive trace impurities in high value raw materials (dyes, salt, water, alkali, fiber). 4. Develop and evaluate color measurement and chitosan sorption treatment systems for textile wastewater.  The primary goal of this quarter was to complete the pretrial C.O.D. and B.O.D. experiments, so that fiber samples can be run routinely. This task was accomplished. The main task was to determine the concentration of the fiber sample in order to apply the appropriate standard C.O.D. range for the C.O.D. reactor digestor method. B.O.D. can not be run unless the C.O.D. experiment is finalized in order to determine the correct concentration level to be applied in the B.O.D. experiment.  28  Natinnal 7-extile Center Quarterly Report: April - June 1993"

PLA is a new biodegradable plastic that’s derived from corn and replaces nonrenewable fossil raw materials. This culminates years of R&D by Cargill and others whose efforts were supported by the  Agriculture  Team, as well as other parts of DOE and other Federal agencies. The PLA market could eventually exceed 8 billion lb/year–saving 190 trillion Btu of energy. “PLA represents one of the single largest impacts we have in the Agriculture Team on energy savings,” said Team Leader Mark Paster (202-586-2821).                      Succinic acid is another plant-based raw material that could compete with fossil fuel-derived feedstocks used to manufacture paints, plastics and other products. High production cost has kept succinic acid from being widely used. “But we’ve had incremental successes in this area for several years and two recent R&D projects have forwarded technology to the point where succinic acid is financially attractive,” said Paster. He expects commercial-scale production of lower cost succinic acid to soon begin.                     A “Clean Fractionation” project co-supported by OIT’s  Agriculture  and  Chemical  Teams is being scaled up to pilot stage. The technology enables manufacture of high purity cellulose using significantly less energy than incumbent processes. Projected potential energy savings are 13 trillion Btu/year by 2020.                                           Chemicals Turning waste carpeting into commercial raw materials            The Chemicals Team is proud of its “pipeline of successful projects moving toward commercialization,” said Team Leader Paul Scheihing (202-586-7234). One commercial success is the “Nylon 6 Recycling” project, which recently earned both the Society of Plastic Engineers “Recycler of the Year,” and The Design for Humanity Award. Honeywell and DSM Chemicals use the technology at their Evergreen Nylon Recycling plant in Augusta, GA—the largest commercial-scale nylon recycling plant in the world. The plant can convert waste carpeting back to virgin-quality monomers keeping an estimated 200 million pounds of carpet out of landfills, annually, and saving 4.4 trillion Btu.                      About to enter the pilot stage is another Team-sponsored technology, “Catalytic Hydrogenation Retrofit Reactor.” It improves the commonly-used hydrogenation process by replacing a slurry catalyst system with a monolith catalyst reactor. The new process uses less energy and reduces environmental and safety concerns of the incumbent method.                     The Team is also supporting the Multi-Phase Fluid Dynamics Research Consortium which brings together the country’s leading chemical companies, engineering universities and DOE Labs in an unprecedented partnership. The group is developing new techniques that will lead to better understanding of gas-solid flow. This will lead to improved chemical process yields and provide very large energy savings due to the widespread prevalence of gas-solid flow in the chemical industry.                                           Forest Products Burning sludge without NOx emissions           Forest Products  Team Leader Valri Robinson (202-586-0937) identified three especially promising technologies recently supported by the Team that are now being demonstrated at partner facilities. “Perhaps the most successful is the ‘Methane de-NOx Reburning Process’ being demonstrated at a Boise Cascade (BC) plant,” she said. “Natural gas is injected into the combustion zone to create an oxygen-deficient environment that reduces NOx formation. Mills are interested because it could allow disposal of sludge by burning rather than landfilling without increasing emissions. BC reports they can burn 400% more sludge than before, while maintaining NOx levels. Other benefits include a reduction in overall gas use and an increase in boiler efficiency, saving nearly $700,000/year on equipment that costs just $400,000 to install.”                     In another demonstration at a Visy Paper facility in Georgia, mechanical rather than chemical means are employed to detackify “stickies” that lead to excessive costs and downtime for recycling mills. The new process reduces the cost of chemicals and their environmental impacts, and could save more than 1 billion kWh/year.           Another successful technology, “On-line Fluidics Controlled Headbox,” is being demonstrated at a Smurfit-Stone mill in Florence, SC. It allows a mill to process 10-15% less fiber per sheet which could save up to 60 trillion Btu/year by 2020.                                           Aluminum Revolutionizing the way aluminum is made            The  Aluminum  Team is partnering with Northwest Aluminum Co. on a project that will change the way aluminum is made and could reduce the energy required for smelting by 25-30%. The process uses a new cell design with a non-consumable inert metal anode to produce aluminum. It has lower energy intensity, lower cost and lower environmental impacts than the traditional Hall – Heroult technology.                      Another team project, led by Secat, Inc., addresses the oxidative melt problem that accounts for a loss of up to 4% of secondary aluminum during the melting process. “This project is a model partnership, bringing together representatives from industry, universities and DOE Labs,” said Aluminum Team Leader Sara Dillich (202-586-7925). “It will help solve a long-standing plant floor problem while enhancing our understanding of the oxidation process. Best of all, it will reduce energy losses by up to 50%.”                     In a partnership with DOE’s Office of Transportation Technologies and the auto and aluminum industries, the Team is championing an “Automotive Aluminum Scrap Sorting” technology that will likely achieve fast commercialization. Using laser induced spectroscopy, the new process will allow rapid separation of cast and wrought aluminum and aluminum alloys, thereby facilitating the use of recycled rather than primary metal.                                           Steel New electronic technologies saving energy in demanding steel environments            A  Steel  Team project is developing a model to better control pre-heated air in blast furnaces. The model will allow tighter control over temperature and flow rates thereby reducing fuel use. Overcoming a number of obstacles, the project partners began using the model on a blast furnace at Inland Steel where natural gas use was subsequently cut by about 7%. The model is now being used on all three of the mill’s blast furnaces.                      An electric arc furnace optical sensor developed in a Team partnership was recently proven successful in a prototype trial at The Timken Company’s Faircrest Steel Plant in Canton, OH. The laser-based system measures the composition of gases exiting a steel-melting furnace, facilitating real-time process control. Timken projects a 10% improvement in productivity and a 2% increase in energy efficiency. An extended trial is now underway.                     A third project is helping more accurately control the properties of hot rolled steel, yielding a more refined product with less variability. In use at several AISI-member mills, the hot strip mill model runs on a PC, and has shown the ability to reliably correlate operating parameters to resulting properties of hot rolled steel.                     “These three successes provide a broad spectrum of value to the steel industry,” said OIT’s new Steel Team Leader Isaac Chan (202-586-4981). “They help save energy in an integrated steel mill, in electric arc steelmaking, and downstream in the rolling area.”                                           Metal Casting Doubling of steel die lifetimes sought            “The Metal Casting Team’s R&D portfolio has been making important contributions to industry-identified roadmap priorities and OIT’s energy efficiency goals,” said Team Leader Harvey Wong (202-586-9235). One project led by The Materials Technology Laboratory is helping industry to better understand copper alloys. It has created the first-ever comprehensive database on these materials, and details the mechanical, fracture toughness, impact, and fatigue properties of 13 copper alloys. Use of this information is expected to contribute to processing efficiencies saving 1.2 trillion Btu and reducing CO2 emissions by 120,000 tons.                     Led by the Univ. Alabama/Birmingham, “Lost Foam Casting,” is improving process controls for this casting method. It offers significant cost and environmental advantages, and enables metal casters to produce complex parts that are often not possible using other methods. Compared to traditional green sand or resin-bonded sand molding methods, potential energy savings of “lost foam” amount to about 27% (4.7 trillion Btu/year by 2020) with a 46% improvement in labor productivity. The Team’s work has made lost foam a practical reality, and its use is increasing by as much as 20% per year.                     Steel dies can take months to manufacture and cost over $1 million. Moreover, die testing and manufacturing can be energy intensive. A team led by Case Western Reserve Univ. is identifying composition and processing techniques that lead to improved thermal fatigue resistance, increased die           life and reduced die cost. Die life improvements of 50-100% have been seen, resulting in considerable energy savings.

GX032-45-12513344	Final Report: Electrochemical Treatment of Textile Effluents with Simultaneous Recovery of Toxic Metals      EPA Contract Number:   68D98114     Title:   Electrochemical Treatment of Textile Effluents with Simultaneous Recovery of Toxic Metals      Investigator:   Dr. Charles L.K. Tennakoon      Small Business:       Lynntech, Inc.    7610 Eastmark Drive, Suite 105                  College Station, TX  77840                      Telephone Number:  (409) 693-0017                EPA Contact:   SBIR Program Manager     Phase:  I   Project Period:    6 months    Project Amount:   $70,000     Research Category:   Wastewater      Abstract:    Currently, the textile dyeing industry is under considerable pressure to reduce the color of process waters directly discharged to municipal water treatment facilities. While the color issue has received considerable attention, more recently heavy metals (copper and chromium in particular) found in some dyes, and the toxicity of organics formed by the degradation of dyes and dye auxiliaries are being considered within the framework of pretreatment regulations. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting to reduce the hazards associated with waste sludges disposed of in landfill sites through the requirements of the Toxicity Characteristics Leachate Procedure (TCLP). Metals such as chromium and selected organics, including some acknowledged dye breakdown products, e.g., aromatic amines, are the focus of concern. Additionally, under federal mandate, states are establishing stream water quality standards which will tighten National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.   In this Phase I effort, two approaches were investigated to treat textile effluents. The electrochemical treatment by anodic oxidation using anodes with catalytic coatings effectively oxidized the dye wastes. However, three industrial effluents tested generated chlorine gas during anodic oxidation making the process, limited in its applicability due to the possibility of forming chlorinated byproducts. Cathodic treatment using electrochemically assisted Fentons reagent also effectively oxidized the dye solutions. However, this method required initial pH adjustment to between 2 and 4, before the electrochemical step, making the process unattractive.   The other method tested using ion-exchanged zeolites together with hydrogen peroxide, was a very attractive process. Several synthetic zeolites and a natural zeolite were ion-exchanged with different cations, e.g., Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II). Out of the synthetic zeolites, Fe(II) exchanged ZSM-5 was superior. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, ion-exchanged with Fe(II) was found to be even more effective than Fe(II)-exchanged ZSM-5. Since the catalytic Fe(II) sites are bound to the zeolite structure, no sludges are formed and the cations released to the solution during organometallic dye degradation were found to absorbed by the zeolites. Thus, toxic metals like copper or cobalt released during dye degradation can be easily recovered using this process. Similarly, the process is amenable to scale-up as packed columns of Fe(II)-exchanged zeolites can be used for waste oxidation. Similarly, the toxic metals ion-exchanged onto zeolites can be easily leached out using dilute acids. In addition, it was also found that spent zeolite columns loaded with organic dyes can be regenerated by using 30% hydrogen peroxide solutions. This allows the effective regeneration of the columns.   The hydrogen peroxide decays to oxygen and water, so the entire system is environmentally friendly. Zeolites are non-toxic aluminosilicates and pose no disposal problems. Natural zeolites and the chemicals required (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate) are inexpensive making the process economical. All these advantages makes this advanced non-photoassisted catalytic oxidation process using Fe(II)-exchanged natural zeolites, a very attractive process for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. The feasibility of this process has been amply demonstrated to recommend further studies under a possible follow-on Phase II project.     Original Abstract         Last Updated:  September 8, 1999

Sewell     PROGRESS OF WORK AND PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS:    Objective 1: To develop and characterize innovative textile and related materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis on agricultural fibers and by-products.    Participating stations continued the development and characterization of value added products from agricultural crops including kenaf, sugar cane, cotton, soybeans, and wheat straw. Woven fabrics were constructed with 100% cotton warp yarns and filling yarns of 50% chemically retted kenaf/50% cotton [MS]. These new fabrics, that are lighter weight than the previous kenaf fabrics, were treated with a fluorocarbon finish to improve water, oil, and stain resistance. Twill weave treated fabrics were weathered, industrially laundered, and abraded to determine surface wear [KS, KY]. Weathering did not affect abrasion resistance, while laundering increased the resistance, probably due to shrinkage that produced a thicker fabric. Washing increased warp flex abrasion, the direction with all cotton yarns, but decreased the flex abrasion of the kenaf blend yarns in the filling direction. The kenaf/cotton blend fabric was dyed with natural dyes, and used in a fashion garment [KS]. Two kenaf cultivars, Everglades 41 and Tainung #2, were water retted to extract fibers [AR]. Dyed fibers were ground in a Wiley mill and used to produce flocked designs on wallpaper.  Sugar cane fibers were extracted from bagasse directly by sifting the bagasse and treating the larger pieces in a continuous reactor with 0.1N NaOH [LA]. Fibers were formed into erosion control mats from a water slurry and evaluated for biodegradability [LA, AR]. Bagasse fiber bundles were also carded on a laboratory card [LA]. Carding decreased the tex from 350 to 50 and the length from 25 to 15 cm.   Laminated nonwovens with cotton/polypropylene (PP) webs on one or both sides of a PP spunbonded core were produced and evaluated. The two and three layered laminates were soft and strong, with a hand similar to cotton knits or hydroentangled nonwovens. A patented post treatment process was applied to increase the stretch of the experimental products, yielding elastic recoveries of 83-93% after 50% extension.  The effect of cellulase enzymes as a pretreatment on cotton denim fabrics was investigated [IN]. The treatment decreased fiber surface area and pore volume but did not significantly change direct dye yield. Glucose concentration, weight loss, and strength loss all decreased with increasing treatment time and enzyme concentration. Plasma treatment was investigated as a method for immobilizing enzymes on surfaces using films as models for fabrics [WI]. The plasma formed carbonyl groups that reacted with the enzyme amine functionalities.  Layered strawboards were produced from wheat straw [KS]. Bleaching of wheat straw was optimized and straw fibers were dyed with basic dyes which had greater substantivity for the fibers than did acid or basic dyes. Alkyd resins were produced as a by-product of soybeans and used for pigment printing of cotton and cotton blend fabrics [KS].     Objective 2: To assess the environmental compatibility of selected and newly developed processes, materials, and products from fibers of polymeric and agricultural origin.    Treatment of polyester and PP spunbonded nonwovens with plasma at near atmospheric pressure improved the dyeability of these fabrics [TN]. The treatment produced a skin-core fiber structure in which a skin of functional groups, approximately 1.8 µ thick, was easily colored with environmentally friendly water soluble acid dyes.   The biodegradability of cotton, rayon, lyocell, and polyester fabrics was tested by burial in both neutral and acid soils [AR]. All fabrics except polyester were completely degraded in the neutral soil in 26 weeks, but degradation was somewhat slower in the acid soil. Sugar cane fiber mats produced in LA were also submitted to soil burial [AR]. After eight weeks all of the buried samples had lost over 80% of their weight, with a higher rate of degradation in the neutral soil.  Laundry disks, that were developed to replace detergents, were evaluated and determined to perform no better than water alone in removing stains [KS].     Objective 3: To evaluate the functional performance, consumer acceptance, and potential commercialization of textile materials for human health and safety and/or value added products.    The distribution of pesticide residues on protective clothing (PC) was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and image analysis [NC]. Pesticide residues were identified on contaminated fabrics and the higher the fiber surface area, the fewer were the number of pesticide crystals formed on the surface. Physicians' scrub suits were constructed of a nonwoven protective fabric and are being evaluated by medical personnel [LA]. The transmission of bacteria through PC fabrics was studied using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and SEM [GA]. Of several bacterial species investigated, only  e. coli  could be located. Fabric structure and fiber content were the primary factors affecting transmission.  The effectiveness of clothing fabrics for sun protection is being investigated [NE, AU]. Laundering with detergents containing an optical brightening agent improved the ultraviolet (UV) blocking ability of cotton and cotton/polyester fabrics, but not that of 100% nylon and 100% polyester [NE]. Differences in protection from UV radiation were found among a number direct dyes studied [KS]. Black dyes did not necessarily provide the best protection. The rate of degradation of titanium dioxide treated fabrics was studied to assess the effectiveness of this compound in enhancing UV protection [AU]. A study of the sun exposure of children and of parents' attitudes toward clothing protection is underway [FL].  Nonwoven fabrics for surgical gowns and drapes were treated with two fluorochemical and antimicrobial finishes in a one-step process and evaluated for repellency and antimicrobial activity [GA]. Polyester fabrics with an experimental finish to improve moisture transport were wear tested by exercising subjects [FL] and preliminary analyses suggest that the finish is effective in reducing skin wetness. Moisture transport through PC fabrics was evaluated under low and high temperature/humidity conditions [AU].  The aesthetic and performance properties of polyester microfiber knitted fabrics was studied [NC]. Fiber fineness affected subjective and objective hand measurements, but treatment with silicone fabric softeners did not.  A survey of Louisiana consumers was conducted to determine the indicators used to assess apparel [LA]. Fiber content was an important indicator, with natural fibers perceived as being of better quality than synthetics.     USEFULNESS OF FINDINGS:    Processes for making value added textile products are being refined and applications are becoming more focused. As process economics are considered and product properties determined, end use markets can be developed. The appropriateness of kenaf for tents and awnings, as well as for craft products, was demonstrated. Sugar cane bagasse can be economically converted to biodegradable erosion control mats and strawboards from wheat can be produced. Assessment of the environmental impact of processing and use of current textile products, being investigated in this project, will yield benefits as well.  Protective clothing that provides the necessary safety margin along with an acceptable comfort level is an important effort. Methods for evaluating comfort and safety of new and modified textile products are being developed to help producers and consumers, and consumer perceptions and market potential of these fabrics are being determined. Use of cotton in nonwoven products will considerably improve their comfort properties. Provision of information on selection of clothing for maximum protection from UV radiation will also help consumers.     WORK PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR:    Development and evaluation of cotton nonwoven, kenaf, sugar cane, wheat straw textiles will continue, with pooling of resources in the participating stations to more effectively characterize the products. Polyester microfibers will be blended with fine cotton fibers and fabrics for greater comfort. Gathering and analysis of subjective data on fabric comfort and safety and on consumer perceptions of new products will be completed.

Welch           S-272 Administrative Advisor : B. Brown           PROGRESS OF WORK AND PRINCIPAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS:            Objective 1: To develop and characterize innovative textile and       related materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis on       agricultural fibers and by-products.            Many newer products were created and tested for performance. A joint       project resulted in a nonwoven blanket produced from cotton and recycled       polyester. The experimental blanket was comparable to commercial nonwoven       blankets in comfort, quality, and thermal covering. Polymers from waste       were recovered and recycled into thermoplastic composites for food       packaging, wound dressings and hygiene products. Cotton and glass fabrics       were grafted with linking compounds and TiO2 and evaluated for their       ability to destroy low concentrations of gaseous organic compounds in the       presence of UV light. The treated glass fabrics may have application in       removing air borne organic contaminates. Wheat gluten was modified with       methyl acrylate, sodium hydroxide, and ethanol and characterized by dye       binding techniques and NMR and the films made were evaluated for       performance properties.           Alpha-chymotrypsin was successfully deposited on RF-plasma treated PET,       PP and PS substrates. Computer-aided conformational modeling was used to       study the mobility of the enzyme. Stability of the enzyme was good and it       retained it’s activity even after several washing/assay cycles. A       nonwoven fabric with a cotton surface was developed with increased       resistance to pilling and linting. This fabric was tested for fabric hand       and comfort in a wear study conducted in an environmental chamber.            Fabric softeners developed by Albemarle were evaluated on cotton and       50/50 cotton/polyester using the new data acquisition system for the       Kawabata instruments. The most important fabric properties were shear       rigidity and shear hysteresis. Attempts were made to improve the softness       and wrinkle resistance of kenaf/cotton fabrics using softeners,       formaldehyde, low formaldehyde and non-formaldehyde resins. Experimental       kenaf/cotton fabrics in shirt weight were developed for apparel.           A research grant (LEQSF) from the Louisiana Board of Regents was       obtained by LSU scientists to install a narrow weaving machine (Jacob       Muller NF42 2/130). This allowed the processing of non-conventional       fibers, such as sugar cane rind, kenaf, ramie, and flax, into yarns and       fabrics. Bagasse treated- with caustic, water etc., was evaluated for       possible use as a yarn forming fiber source. Fibers were stiff and further       modifications of the processes is being researched.            Dyeuptake and colorfastness studies on polylactic acid (PLA) fabrics       suggested that small linear dyes provided good color, however,       anthraquinone dyes and other dyes with carbonyl groups should be avoided.       Washfastness, lightfastness and resistance to fume fading was acceptable.           The dyeability of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthallate       (PET) with water-based dyes was enhanced by treating them with near       atmospheric plasma treatment.            The formulation for print paste with soybean alkyd binders are still       being optimized to obtain the best color, softness and colorfastness. The       bleaching procedure for wheat straw was optimized to obtain a bright,       creamy white color that will be used to increase the value of strawboards.       The performance of bleached straw boards was compared with regular wood       particle board. High resin composites (bioplastics) with wheat straw were       successfully made for injection molded products. Cellulose was extracted,       purified and characterized for use in various products.           Starch (both native and treated) were characterized by ESCA, FTIR, and       SEM and grafted using the plasma treatment for applications in       biodegradable plastics. Results showed that plasma treatment was       successful in functionalizing the surface of starch.           Objective 2: To assess the environmental compatibility of selected       and newly developed processes, materials, and products from fibers of       polymeric and agricultural origin.            The soil burial study has been continued to include outside burial. The       previous study related to biodegradation in compartmentalized trays housed       within a constant temperature chamber. For this new study, cotton,       rayon,Tencel, kenaf , hemp and cotton canvas and hemp and cotton            denim have been included in the outside burial study. End result will be       a comparative analysis of biodegradation properties for fabrics buried       outside and in the constant temperature room.            The fungal and termite resistance of wheat, barley, and oat straw fiber,       and kenaf, corn husk, sugar cane baggase, and soybean hulls were evaluated       in both no-choice and choice feeding tests.           Objective 3: To evaluate the functional performance, consumer       acceptance, and potential commercialization of textile materials for human       health and safety and/or value added products.            Since cotton is competing with microdenier polyester fabrics, a database       for the properties of microdenier polyester fabrics was developed. The       effect of silicone finishes on aesthetics and hand of the fabrics were       studied. The correlation between instrument measurements of hand and       actual subjective ratings were also determined. Nonwoven fabrics, produced       by Tennessee, containing cotton fibers on the surface were evaluated for       hand related properties using a ring friction apparatus which is capable       of distinguishing small differences in fabric hand.           To determine consumer acceptance and market analysis of non-coventional       textile fibers in value-added products, a national survey was conducted.       The preliminary results indicated that the respondents: were unfamiliar       with non-traditional fibers such as kenaf, hemp, and jute;            did not feel that textiles contributed significantly to environmental       pollution; and biodegradability was not a factor influencing their       purchasing decisions. National study will be path-analyzed using LISREL.           Two nonwoven fabrics commonly used in surgical gowns and drapes were       treated in a one-bath application with a fluorochemical and antimicrobial       finish. The application was found to be successful and adequate repellency       and antimicrobial activity were achieved. Two plain woven fabrics commonly       used in hospital bedding (sheets) were treated in a one-bath application       with a durable press and antimicrobial finish. The durable press property       of treated fabrics after 50 launderings was satisfactory but antimicrobial       activity was not apparent after the launderings.           Cotton, kenaf and a 50/50 cotton/kenaf blend fabrics/yarns were examined       for differences in zeta potential using direct dye solutions. Zeta       potential was dependent on fiber make-up.            A study examining the influence of fiber type, thickness, thread count,       and porosity on UVR transmission was conducted. Results showed that fabric       porosity was the single best predictor of an undyed woven fabric's       UVR-blocking properties. A detailed study on the influence of chemical       constitution of dyes on the extent of UV protection was evaluated using       cotton and cotton/polyester fabrics.           USEFULNESS OF FINDINGS:            Many innovative products and techniques are being created that will       impact the quality of life. As process economics are considered and       product properties determined, end use markets will be developed.       Assessment of the environmental impact of processing and use of current       value-added textile products, being investigated in this project, will       yield benefits as well.           Protective clothing that provides the necessary safety margin along with       an acceptable comfort level is an important effort. Methods for evaluating       comfort and safety of new and modified           textile products are being developed to help producers and consumers.       Consumer perceptions and market potential of these fabrics are being       determined. Use of cotton in nonwoven products will considerably improve       their comfort properties. Provision of information on selection of       clothing for maximum protection from UV radiation will also help       consumers.           This research project has proven the potential to produce low- cost       nonwoven products using recycled synthetic fibers. This research provided       industry with a new technique of objective evaluation for fabric       softeners. The acquisition of narrow gauge loom not only enhanced the       Louisiana agricultural economy, but also benefited the ongoing regional       research project.            WORK PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR:            The focus of the research during the next year will be to finalize the       optimization of all conditions for producing products and processes that       enhance the quality of life. Development and evaluation of newer cotton       nonwovens, kenaf, sugar cane textiles, wheat straw composites, grafted       starch for biodegradable plastics will continue, with pooling of resources       from the participating stations to more effectively characterize and test       the performance of these products. Gathering and analysis of subjective       data on fabric comfort and safety and on consumer perceptions of new       products will be completed.

Research     activities in this reporting period are continuously focused on the three     research objectives: development and characterization of innovative textile     and related materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis     on agricultural fibers and by-products; assessment of the environmental     compatibility of selected and newly developed processes, materials, and     products from fibers of polymeric and agricultural origin; and evaluation of     the functional performance, consumer acceptance, and potential     commercialization of textile materials for human health and safety and/or     value-added products. Achieved research progress under these directions is     summarized in the following aspects.       1.To develop and characterize innovative textile and related     materials from natural and synthetic polymers with an emphasis on     agricultural fibers and by-products       Development of Value-added Products from Renewable/Recyclable     Resources       New Lyocell and Composite Fibers and Fabrics Derived from Biomass .     The formation of lyocell fibers from N-methyl morpholine N-oxide     monohydrate, NMMO.H2O, solutions in conditions allowing a tailored     fibrillation was investigated at KS, TN, and LA-LSU. This was achieved by     controlling rheological parameters in the liquid crystalline phase preceding     fiber formation or by using an electrical discharge (cold plasma) radio     frequency technique, developed by WI and LA-LSU. Work also was done on     spinning lyocell fibers from kenaf, steam exploded bagasse, and wheat straw.            Cellulose sources investigated at TN were: bleached and unbleached     hardwood, bleached and unbleached softwood, bleached and unbleached “in-house”     recycled newsprint paper, and bleached and unbleached thermal/mechanical     (TM) cellulose paper pulps, all obtained from a newsprint paper mill. Other     non-wood cellulose sources for preparation of lyocell solutions were kudzu     vines and bagasse, a by-product of sugar cane processing. Standard lyocell     solutions for comparison were prepared from as-received commercially     available dissolving pulps with two difference degrees of polymerization     (DP): 670 and 1720. The NMMO monohydrate was obtained by distillation of a     50% solution obtained commercially. For each solution, the NMMO monohydrate     was combined with 1% (wt) propyl gallate (a common cellulose preservative)     and the appropriate weight of cellulose in the internal mixer of a Brabender     extruder. Four solution concentrations were prepared for each cellulose     source: 4%, 6%, 8%, and 14% (wt). Commercial dissolving pulps were used to     prepare 14% standard solutions from the different DP pulps and three blends.      Rheological behavior of the solutions was measured on an Advanced     Rheometric Expansion System (ARES).       Higher concentration and DP solutions are more elastic at typical     processing strain rates than are lower concentration solutions. The elastic     behavior at these strain rates increases the relaxation time of the polymers     and results in more orientation in the fibers. Several undervalued cellulose     sources exhibited similar flow behavior to the industry standards indicating     the potential of the undervalued cellulosic sources as starting materials     for lyocell fibers. The bleached and unbleached hardwood and softwood paper     industry pulps had the lowest viscosity values of all of the cellulose     sources and these values were even lower than lowest dissolving pulp     standard. The bleached and unbleached hardwood and softwood cellulose     sources would not be suitable for lyocell unless blended with a higher     viscosity cellulosic source. Bagasse was also similar to the low DP pulp.     Recycled and TM paper pulps exhibited flow behavior similar to the bleached     commercial pulps. Since blended pulps are used commercially, these sources     are candidates for further study to determine their fiber forming     capabilities. Kudzu had a higher viscosity than the highest industry     standard (DP1720) indicating it might be used as a blend with a lower     viscosity undervalued cellulose source to lower the viscosity to an     acceptable range. However the kudzu was extremely difficult to dissolve.       High Performance Degradable Cotton-core Nonwovens.  Scientists at     TN developed this innovative nonwoven product. A more biodegradable and     highly absorbent Cotton-Core Nonwoven (CCN) was developed by laminating a     totally biodegradable melt blown (MB) web on one side, as the thermal binder     component, and a spunbond polypropylene (PP) on the other side of a carded     cotton/PP staple fiber blended web. It was found that infrared (IR) bonding     effectively bonded the new CCN laminate without thermally damaging the     biodegradable web, as did calendaring. The absorbent cotton-based cores had     a weight of 51 g/m2 and consisted of carded 75/25 and 50/50 cotton/PP staple     fiber blends. The new CCNs containing a biodegradable MB web as the thermal     bonding component had excellent tearing strength and tenacity, as well as     exceptionally high water absorbency. In the coming year, the PP in the core     and in the SB web will be replaced with completely biodegradable polymers     with acceptable strength and absorbency.       Development of Pigment Printing Systems with Soybean Alkyd Binders .     Approximately 50% of all textile printing worldwide and 80% of the textile     printing in the U.S. is currently done with pigments. Traditionally, the     binders used in pigment printing are based on acrylic resins obtained     primarily from petrochemical raw materials. Alkyd resins made from soybean     oil represent a major use of this agricultural commodity in the midwestern     United States. Utilizing resins and polymeric materials, such as alkyds,     made from agricultural derivatives and byproducts will decrease our     dependence on petrochemicals and increase the commercial benefits for     farmers. Alkyd resins are fatty acid modified polyester resins formed by the     reaction between a dibasic acid and a polyhydric alcohol, which is then     modified with a triglyceride (soybean oil).       A comprehensive study was completed on the potential use of commercial     available, water reducible soybean-based alkyd resins for pigment printing     100% cotton and 65/35% polyester/cotton blend poplins. Various printing     trials were performed to determine the influence of curing conditions and     selected products (catalysts, softeners, lowcrock agents, and plasticisers)     on the quality of the prints. The pigment prints containing the alkyd     binders also were compared with fabrics printed with commercial     ready-for-use print pastes. All of the print pastes contained C.I. Pigment     Blue 15:3 – a widely used phthalocyanine pigment. The quality of the     prints were evaluated for color yield, stiffness, and colorfastness     properties        Among the eight temperature-time variations evaluated in Printing Trial     #1, curing conditions of 160oC for 4 min. gave the best balance of     properties and was used in the subsequent printing trials. In all of the     printing trials performed, the prints containing the soybean alkyd binders     were consistently brighter and more intense than the prints containing the     acrylic binder. In addition, the shades were brighter on the 100% cotton     poplin as compared to the 65/35 polyester/cotton poplin fabric. The     concentration of the pigment influenced the depth of shade as well as the     colorfastness properties. However, pigment concentration had little effect     on stiffness. Among the softeners types evaluated, it was shown that the     chemical nature and concentration of the softener can significantly     influence print quality. The cationic softener gave comparatively lower     colorfastness properties as compared to the silicone emulsions, but improved     the depth of shade. In most of the printing trials, the colorfastness     properties (i.e., to dry crocking, washing, and dry cleaning) reached the     minimum performance specifications in ASTM for textile fabrics based on     end-use, except for wet crockfastness. Hence, a commercially available, low     wet crock agent containing a latex binder was evaluated, but it did not     appreciably improve the wet crocking. In general, the medium oil, chained     stopped, water reducible alkyd used in many of the printing trials gave     performance properties that were comparable to the RFU prints. This shows     that the alkyds do have potential to be marketed in the RFU market.        Based on the cumulative results of this study, two formulations     containing alkyd binders are recommended for use in textile printing. Even     though the alkyd binders have potential use in unformulated and     pre-formulated products because of their performance and good shelf     stability, they do not out perform the acrylic binder used in this study.     Another potential area of research is developing alkyd polymers that out     perform the acrylic resins or developing 100% soybean resins for the pigment     printing area.       Chemical and Morphological Studies of Lignocellulosics for Composite     Applications . Wheat straw boards are produced in many of the major wheat     producing countries, but with limited success. One of the major limitations     in making wheat straw boards is that conventional phenol-formaldehyde (PF)     resin systems are not suitable for bonding together the straw particles. The     most widely used resin for making wheat straw boards is isocyanates, which     are about 50% more expensive than PF resins. In addition, isocyanates     present health and environmental hazards. Strawboard manufacturing could be     more economically viable if a suitable PF resin system could be developed.     The KS researchers investigated the effectiveness of various mechanical and     chemical treatments on the quality of the straw boards produced with     selected resin types. Obtained results help promote agriboards and related     products made from wheat straw fiber as a timber substitute. The replacement     of particle and fiber board with wheat straw board has potential to add     value to wheat - an important agriculture commodity in Kansas and other     Midwest states.        Kenaf Composites . The KS researchers also investigated the     feasibility of using kenaf fiber for producing laminating materials. Kenaf     and it's blends make an excellent fiber-source for nonwoven underlay for     laminated products because of their excellent mechanical properties.     Potential uses for kenaf nonwoven substrates include wallcoverings,     upholstery covers, furniture underlay, edgebanding materials, and     architectural panels. They investigated the feasibility of using kenaf     fibers blended with polypropylene at a ratio of 80:20, to form carded batt     (dry laid nonwoven structure). Kenaf fibers were carded on a modified cotton     card. The batt were either calendered or needlepunched and cured in an oven     to make the substrates. These substrates were then laminated with various     kinds of overlays, such as polyester woodgrain, phenolic resin impregnated     kraft paper, and decorative vinyl. Kenaf was shown to be feasible for making     nonwoven textiles for use in laminated products. In addition to providing a     new natural-fiber source for nonwoven textiles, kenaf fibers can also     provide better mildew resistance than cotton and other bast fibers such as     jute and ramie.        Bagasse Composites . Sugarcane refining generates a large volume     of residue, bagasse. Converting this residue into value-added products     benefits both the agricultural industry and environmental protection.     Researchers at LA-LSU and USDA-SRRC developed bagasse/kenaf/polymer fiber     composites. Bagasse fiber was extracted by a chemical method and blended     with polymer binding fibers for nonwoven processing. The fiber composites     were finally formed by a hot-press procedure. These bagasse composites weigh      between 186 ~ 2600 g/m2, with different thickness ranging from 0.08 inch to     0.25 inch. Engineered nonwoven structure included multi-component and     multi-layer structure, sandwich structure, and laminating structure. These     biobased composites have great potentials for diverse end-uses in     furnishing, housing, agricultural, and other industrial sectors.        New Use of Kenaf Fiber . Kenaf is now a market-ready commodity     used in making paper, cordage, fabric blends, etc. Considerable work has     been done on fiber preparation and end-use promotions. Researchers at KS     extended the kenaf end-use to apparel application. To enhance fabric     aesthetic performance, effective processing method of kenaf extraction and     enzyme treatment for fabric softness were developed. Research conducted at     AR introduced kenaf to the craft industry for producing various types of     value-added products - baskets, hats, etc. This initial work has made a     formidable influence on the craft industry in AR and other states.        Improved and Innovated Processing Technologies for Textile Applications       Significant progress was achieved in this research area. Improvement and     innovation of processing technologies for raw material preparation, fiber     extraction, and fabric wet processing is highly desired for the textile     industry that is facing global competition and seeking upgraded technologies     to advance end-use performance of textile products.       Bioprocessing . Research at CO extensively studied the     biopreparation of cotton and enzyme kinetics using alkaline pectinases.     Other enzymes used in biopreparation of cotton were amylases for warp     desizing and cellulases for improving surface properties. KS scientists     studied the use of enzymes for biofinishing kenaf and kenaf/cotton fabrics.     Experimental kenaf/cotton fabrics in shirt weight were developed for     apparel. The fabrics were finished with various non-formaldehyde durable     press finishes and evaluated for performance. The improvement in aesthetics     and softness of kenaf/cotton fabrics were evaluated using enzymes     (cellulase, xylanase and pectinase). The improvement in softness was     evaluated using the tester developed at Texas Tech. Xylanases and pectinases     have been used either alone or in combination to obtain compatible pH and     temperature conditions for optimum softness. The use of suitable enzyme     systems in the bioscouring of kenaf/cotton fabrics provided an alternative     to the conventional chemical preparation of these fabrics and enhanced the     aesthetics of the kenaf/cotton fabrics.        The KS scientists also focused on developing enzymatic methods for     purifying/biofinishing of wool and specialty hair fibers using xylanases and     pectinases. All these fibers were obtained from growers. Each fiber type was     treated with combinations of these enzymes at two different temperatures.     All processes were conducted at a fiber to liquor ratio of 1:30, temperature     of 600C and 960C, pH 9.32 and time periods of 60 or 30 minutes. Each     treatment was replicated three times. The resultant fibers from each     treatment were dried, brushed gently and characterized. The single fiber     strength and elongation was measured on the Instron Tester, diameter of     fibers were detemmined using the Projectina, physical structure (length,     width and topical surface) was examined with SEM, and the chemistry of the     resultant fibers were done using FTIR spectroscopy using the KBr. pellet     technique. Obtained data showed that the wool subjected to chlorination and     isomerases was less prone to insect attack.        Scientists at AL investigated the effectiveness of five proteases from     plant and microbial sources on wool fabrics. The AR researchers explored an     enzymatic retting method for extracting kenaf fiber. Comparative analysis     between biological, chemical, and enzymatic retting methods was also     accomplished. Research results indicated the following advantages by using     this particular enzymatic retting method: effectiveness in fiber/core     separation, shortened processing time, and problem-free for environment.            Plasma Applications . Research at WI was focused on     plasma-enhanced synthesis of maltodextrin-polydimethylsiloxane     graft-copolymers. Plasma modification methods served as a pivotal     contribution to the research work at the other contributing institutions in     this project. Ether-extracted Maltodextrin powder was surface functionalized     under 13.56-MHz-RF-SiCl4-plasma conditions, and consecutively  in situ      aminated and grafted using dichlorodimethylsilane. Survey and high     resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR evaluations,     fluorescence-labeling technique, SEM, and DTA/TG analyses prove the presence     of a graft-copolymer layer on the modified starch-granule surfaces and the     existence of a significantly changed surface morphology of the starch     granules, as a result of the grafting reactions. The hydrophobic nature of     the polydimethylsiloxane-grafted starch and its significantly changed     thermal behaviors were also evaluated. It was suggested that     maltodextrin/starch- and polydimethylsiloxane-based block-copolymers might     find their applications as reinforcing components in silicon rubber     materials       Non-conventional Material Dyeing and Digital Printing . Research     at NE investigated application and performance of disperse dyes on     polylactic acid (PLA) fabric. The NE scientists also launched the study on     modifications of wheat gluten film properties using ethylene glycol and     hexamethylene diamine. They also investigated solubility of the wheat gluten     and approach to quantifying carboxylic acid groups in the wheat gluten. The     KS researchers focused on adding value to agri-composites through bleaching,     dyeing, and controlling particle size. An H2O2 bleaching system with an     acetic acid rinse substantially improved the whiteness of the straw.     Scientist at LA-SU launched research on digital printing by an outstanding     funding support from industries.        2.To assess the environmental compatibility of selected and newly     developed, processes, materials and products from fibers of polymeric and     agricultural origin       Enhanced Biological Resistance for Protein Fibers . Researchers     at KS and WI focused on the biological resistance of wool. A recent study     has shown that most wool and specialty hair fibers are readily attacked by     webbing clothes moth and black carpet beetle larvae, but the extent of     degradation is influenced somewhat by animal type, fiber fineness, and     chemical treatments. Current work at KS and WI is evaluating multifunctional     reactive dyes and plasma treatments for imparting insect control.       Development of Biodegradable Textiles . Cotton has many     outstanding properties suitable for constructing effective capillary control     in absorbent nonwovens. Internal microscopic pore spaces of cotton     contribute to its ability to swell during the transition from the dry to the     wet state. The excellent absorbency and water retention properties of     cotton-core laminates with melt-blown polypropylene webs have been     demonstrated, but these nonwovens are not biodegradable. Nonwovens made of     PLA or polyesterimide at TN could further expand the use of cotton in the     large absorbent cores market and make the products completely biodegradable     to further increase consumer appeal. Cooperating with USDA-SRRC and LA-LSU,     the AR researchers conducted soil burial study to investigate     biodegradability of color cottons.        Biodegradability and Mildew Resistance of Kenaf Fibers and Fabrics .     Researchers at KS conducted this study under three exposure conditions,     namely, soil burial, atmosphere and pure-culture media tests. Kenaf has to     be bacterially and/or chemically retted for extraction of textile quality     fibers. The retting process affects the extent of removal of lignin,     hemicellulose, pectins and waxes, which may influence the rot and mildew     resistance of kenaf fibers and fabrics. Therefore, biodegradation of kenaf     fibers and kenaf-incorporated nonwoven fabrics, and mildew resistance of the     kenaf/cotton fabric was studied under different exposure conditions. Fiber     retting method for fibers did not influence biodegradation in soil. Adding     kenaf to nonwoven fabrics did enhance biodegradation of nonwoven fabrics and     kenaf/cotton fabric was better than cotton at resisting mildew.       To evaluate the functional performance, consumer acceptance and     potential commercialization of textile materials for human health and safety     and/or value added products       Evaluation of Fabric UV Transmission . Recent studies by AU, NE,     and KS have focused on quantifying the degree of UV protection afforded by     textile materials and in identifying the various factors that affect it. NE     and KS have generated databases of Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF)     values for a range of fiber and fabric types. Researchers at NE investigated     the influence of fiber type, fabric structure, water type, artificial light     exposure, and laundering on a fabric UV transmission. Results showed that     fabric porosity, as estimated by image analysis, was the single best     predictor of an undyed woven fabric’s UVR-blocking properties. Fiber     type and thickness also proved to be important determinants. Polyester,     silk, and wool fabrics exhibited better UVR-blocking properties than cotton     or rayon when porosity and thickness were taken into account. The results     also showed that water type does not significantly influence UVR     transmission properties of fabrics. These findings indicated that AATCC and     ASTM committees responsible for developing standard test methods for the     preparation of test specimens and measurement of UPF in wet fabrics may     simply specify distilled water for the protocol, which is the simplest and     least expensive water type to include in standard test methods.       The KS researchers investigated the influence of 95 dyes on the UV     protection provided by cotton and nylon fabrics and the relationship between     chemical constitution and UV absorption. Most of the dyes caused a     substantial reduction in the UV transmission, and the reduction was linear     with concentration up to a point. The interpretation of the absorption     spectra of the dyes with respect to their chemical structure indicated that     in most dyes, UV absorption depended on specific structural attributes     rather than the chemical class to which they belong.       These findings have proven useful to manufacturers of sun-protective     clothing who supply clothing to skin cancer survivors and patients     undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. This research assists textile and     apparel manufacturers in developing and properly labeling fabrics for sun     protective clothing. The findings of this research helped shape ASTM     standard practices for preparation and measurement of UVR transmission in     fabrics. This research also contributed to the development of computer     software for measuring and calculating UPF in fabrics.       Evaluation of Fabric Protective and Comfort Properties . Studies     accomplished by WI, TN, GA and KS have addressed the barrier properties of     textile substrates for human health and safety. Growing concern about HIV     and other infectious diseases attributed to blood borne pathogens has     resulted in the development and testing of the barrier properties of     textiles to fluids and microorganisms. Researchers at WI and GA have shown     that fabrics treated with low surface tension liquids (fluorochemicals) have     enhanced barrier properties. They also have identified parameters critical     to barrier properties. Researchers at GA studied the mechanism of small     particle transmission through surgical face masks. Porosity, liquid     permeability, and moisture vapor transport rate (MVTR) of the mask samples     were measured using a PMI automated porpmeter. The mechanism of particle     transmission was studied using latex microspheres and Laser Scanning     Confocal microscopy. Work continues on developing moisture permeable fabrics     that provide barriers to liquids and microorganisms. The FL scientists have     focused on the comfort of protective apparel by objective and subjective     methods. Correlations were found between objective and subjective data,     comfort and barrier efficiency, and specific fabric characteristics.       Analysis of Fibers and Finishes by IR Microspectroscopy .      The KS scientists conducted this research. Infrared microspectroscopy     has been used in the forensic analysis of fiber using both transmission and     internal reflection methods. However, the usefulness of transmission     techniques often is limited by the inherent thickness of fibers. Conversely,     attenuated total reflection (ATR) microspectroscopy can be used to     investigate the presence of textile surface treatments, the evenness of the     treatments on the fiber surface, and retention after consumer use or     processing. The outstanding features of ATR microspectroscopy, according to     Wetzel and Cho, are: 1) it is a nondestructive, surface analysis technique,     2) it requires minimal sample reparation, and 3) the depth of penetration     can be controlled. This study demonstrated that nylon, acrylic, cotton,     polyester, and olefin fibers too thick for transmission analysis could be     readily analyzed by ATR. In addition, the ATR spectrum of surface-treated     fibers revealed spectral features of the surface treatment chemicals. ATR     was also useful in identifying the core and sheath portions of a bicomponent     fiber.        Development of Dual Prupose Reactive Dyes for Wool with Coloration     and Insect Control Properties . Researchers at KS evaluated the     effectiveness of commercial and experimental growth inhibitors in reducing     the attack of clothes moths and carpet beetles on wool and to develop a     dual-purpose reactive dye that has both coloration and insect control     properties. All of the dyestuffs and treatments evaluated in this study were     applied to prescoured 100% wool flannel (style #527). Ten reactive dyes were     selected for preliminary evaluation to determine if chromophore type or     reactive group influenced the susceptibility of wool to insect attack. C.I.     Reactive Red 1, 4, and 41, C.I. Reactive Orange 4, and C.I. Reactive Violet     5 where monofunctional disazo dye with dichlorotriazine, monochlorotriazine,     dichloroquinoxalinyl, ""-bromoacrylamidyl, and vinyl sulphone reactive     groups, respetively. C.I. Reactive Red 84 was similar to C.I. Reactive     Orange 29, except it contained an additional functional group. C.I. Reactive     Green 19 and C.I. Reactive Black 5 were disazo dyes with two reactive     groups, e.g., two dichlrotriazine and two vinyl sulphone groups,     respectively. C.I. Brown 10 had a chromium-complexed phthlocyanine     chromaphore with two dichlorotriazine groups. All the dyes were applied to     prescoured wool at a concentration of 2% owf (on weight of fabric) using a     40:1 liquor-to-goods ratio and 1.0% Albegal in an Atlas Launder-Ometer. Dye     exhaustion (%) was measured using absorptiometric readings on the spent     dyebaths.       Three hydrazide growth regulators (tebufenozide, methoxyfenozide, and     halofenozide) and 14 experimental compounds were evaluated for their ability     to reduce the attack of webbing clothes moths and black carpet beetles.     These growth regulators were preformulated by the manufacturers and further     diluted to 0.1% solution with water than applied to the samples with a fan     spray at a 100% wet pick up, thus giving a 0.1% owf add-on. After air drying     and conditioning, the treated samples weighed to the nearest 0.00001 g.        Susceptibility of the wool to webbing clothes moths and black carpet     beetles was evaluated following the procedures in AATCC Test Method 24-1994,     Insects, Resistance of Textiles to. The carpet beetle larvae were 3-4 months     old, average weight 6-7 mg, and retained on a No. 16 screen. The clothes     moth larvae were 25-27 days old as measured from the date of egg deposition.     All of the specimens were incubated for 14 days in a Hot Pack Environmental     Chamber maintained at 27±1·C and 55% .  The extent     of damage caused by carpet beetles larvae was determined by both the     Excrement Weight Method and the Fabric Weight Loss Method, whereas only the     Fabric Weight Loss Method was used with the webbing clothes moth.       The research activities conducted under this technical committee have     made a significant impact in the overlapping area of agriculture, textile     manufacturing, and textile wet processing industry. An important feature of     this impact is the development of environmentally-friendly textiles,     innovative textile processing technologies, and advanced methods of     evaluating textile products. These research accomplishments can be measured     by published papers, received awards, and recognitions by those industries.     Beginning in October 2001, a new 5-year research plan has been activated.     The research committee will continue focusing on those promising research     areas and target the four main objectives: (1) value-added products from     renewable and recyclable resources; (2) bioprocessing and related new     technologies for textile applications; (3) textile systems for protective     and medical applications; and (4) textiles with enhanced resistance (or     susceptibility) to environmental degradation.

GX090-33-2388951	Search Magazine                                                                                                                                             ORNL is doing              its part to make nuclear energy for power production safer, less expensive,              and more efficient.                           Nuclear          Energy:          Assuring Future Energy Supplies         Nuclear power produces one-fifth          of our nations electricity. However, no nuclear power plants have been          ordered in the United States since 1978 because of concerns about waste          storage, radiation, accidents, and costs. Yet, nuclear power is poised          to make a comeback, partly because of concerns about a possible shortage          of power plants (suggested by the inadequate power supply in California          in early 2001) and the long-term effect of coal-fired power plants on          world climate. (Replacing coal plants with nuclear plants will reduce          greenhouse gas emissions.) Also, the nuclear industry surpasses the coal          power industry in lowering electricity production costs and boosting actual          output compared with potential output.                                                                 One              of 103 nuclear power plants in the U.S.                           Whether the nuclear power          industry will experience a resurgence will probably depend on three factors.          First, our nation must find an acceptable way to isolate nuclear wastes          from the environment, including the growing amount of radioactive spent          fuel stored under water at commercial nuclear power plants. The U.S. government          now sees this problem as an energy security issue. ORNL researchers have          analyzed the environmental impacts of nuclear waste disposal at two proposed          sites. Second, the public must be convinced that reactors are essentially          safe. Third, nuclear power must become economically competitive with natural          gas, the fuel of choice for most new power plants. If new reactors are          designed to cost only $1000 for each kilowatt of generating capacity,          then nuclear power may enjoy a revival in our nation.         Three American companies—Exelon,          Entergy, and Dominion Resources—are seriously considering building          new nuclear power plants, ranging from pebble-bed modular reactors (PBMRs)          to gas-turbine modular-helium-cooled reactors (GT-MHRs)—both advanced          reactor concepts on which ORNL will be working. Also, the licenses of          some of the nations 103 nuclear power plants are likely to be renewed,          allowing them to operate for another 30 years.         ORNL, which pioneered the          design of the core, fuel elements, and helium coolant systems for high-temperature          gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), is already playing a role in engineering          nuclear energys comeback. In February 2002 the Department of Energy designated          ORNL and the Idaho National Energy and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL)          as the lead laboratories for gas-cooled-reactor technology.         SECURE NUCLEAR          PLANT DESIGN                                                                 The              diameter of the IRIS containment is 25 meters, compared with 40 meters              for todays pressurized-water-reactor containment. An IRIS power plant              could be expanded through the addition of modules.                           Recognizing the importance          of nuclear power as part of a diverse energy portfolio that will allow          us to reduce dependence on imported fuels, DOEs Office of Nuclear Energy          is leading a road-mapping activity involving 150 persons from industry,          universities, and national labs. The goal is to draw up and select the          best designs for next-generation nuclear power plants that will be built          over the next 30 years. DOE has declared that these designs must provide          improvements in economic competitiveness, safety, and proliferation resistance,          while showing a reduction in radioactive waste production. In February          2002, DOE announced its Nuclear Power 2010 initiative—a new public-private          partnership aimed at building and operating new nuclear power plants in          the United States before the end of this decade.         In the quest to design a near-term          advanced reactor that is cheaper to build and quicker to license, an international          consortium of researchers from universities, industrial firms, utilities,          and laboratories in nine nations is developing the International Reactor          Innovative and Secure (IRIS) nuclear power plant. ORNL is the only DOE          national laboratory participating on this team led by Westinghouse Electric          Company.         IRIS is a pressurized-water          reactor with safety features that have eliminated five out of six most          extreme possible nuclear accidents, says Gordon Michaels, manager of          ORNLs Nuclear Technology Program. Our researchers are developing computational          methods and assessing options for the safe and efficient control of the          reactor core and for plant surveillance and diagnostics. They are also          preparing a probabilistic risk assessment tool to determine the safety          of the conceptual design.         According to Dan Ingersoll,          leader of the Radiation Transport and Physics Group in ORNLs Nuclear          Science and Technology Division (NSTD), the IRIS concept meets DOEs strategic          goals in several ways. It will be more economical because it is more          compact, he says. Whereas todays large nuclear power plants generate          1500 megawatts of electricity, a single IRIS module would generate 100          to 300 megawatts. IRIS is small and simple enough that it could get the          reactor operation cost down to $1000 per kilowatt and may be built in          developing countries.                                                                 This              schematic of the innovative and secure reactor, or IRIS, design shows              the components of the reactor and steam generator in a single vessel.              ORNL plans to seek funding to build a first-of-a-kind, power-producing              IRIS reactor in East Tennessee in 10 to 12 years.                           IRIS is an integral reactor,          which means that the steam generators will be inside the reactor vessel          rather than outside, as is the case with conventional light-water reactors.          This design avoids the risk of a large pipe break because the large pipes          that typically connect the vessel and the steam generators are eliminated          entirely. The small pipelines that carry steam from the reactor vessel          to the turbine are inside a pressurized containment.         If a small pipe were to break          and release steam and water, the water pressure in the reactor vessel          would drop and the air pressure in the containment would rise until the          pressures were equal inside and outside the vessel. As a result, the reactor          core stays covered with enough water to keep it cool, despite the earlier          water loss. Also, the vessel is designed so that natural circulation of          water occurs even if the power to the water pumps is lost, making this          reactor even safer.         IRIS will be more resistant          to proliferation because potential terrorists would have much less access          to the fuel. Todays reactors are opened up every 18 months to remove          and replace fuel. This shuffling of fuel makes it more susceptible to          theft. In an IRIS reactor the fuel residence time is 5 to 8 years. Then          the fuel will be pulled out and sent to a repository or reprocessing plant.          Because IRIS is designed for high burnup of fuel, the spent fuel will          contain less usable fuel and thus be less attractive for diversion.         CHEAPER          NUCLEAR PLANT CONCEPT         One way to reduce nuclear          power plant costs dramatically is to build a reactor that more efficiently          converts its heat into electricity. The route to efficient energy conversion          is to operate a new reactor at higher temperature than current reactors.          Two industrial teams, backing two different reactor concepts, propose          to do just that. An international consortium involving British Nuclear          Fuels and Eskom plans to build the worlds first pebble-bed modular reactor          in Koeberg, South Africa, using technology developed in the 1950s and          1960s by ORNL and German teams. And a U.S. industrial team led by Entergy,          a Southeastern utility that operates 10 commercial power reactors, is          evaluating the deployment of a gas-turbine modular-helium-cooled reactor.         The fuel elements for the          helium-cooled PBMR would be mobile tennis-ball-sized, graphite-coated          spheres—or pebbles—that slowly move though the reactor. The          GT-MHR is powered by stationary fuel elements in the shape of prismatic          blocks. Both fuel forms are built up from tens of thousands of coated          TRISO particles—particles that employ a dense layer of silicon carbide          to trap radioactive fission products. Both reactors would operate at gas          temperatures of 900°C with an efficiency in excess of 43% (compared          with 31% for todays pressurized-water reactors); in other words, more          than 43% of the energy in the fuel core would be converted to electricity.                                                                 Schematic              of a gas-turbine modular helium-cooled reactor.                           ORNL is the lead laboratory          for providing technical support to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in          licensing reviews of the pebble-bed reactor, Michaels says. ORNL and          INEEL jointly manage a new DOE-NRC program for irradiating German pebble          fuel in the Advanced Test Reactor at INEEL. The post-irradiation test          program, headed by Gary Bell of ORNLs Fusion Energy Division, will probably          involve examination and accident-simulation testing of the fuel.         The Entergy-led consortium          has also expressed interest in ORNLs research and laboratory capabilities,          Michaels reports. We are being told that our ability to re-establish          the technology for fabrication of gas-reactor fuel may be essential to          deployment of a new U.S. GT-MHR.         NUCLEAR          FUEL FABRICATION         In a new fuel fabrication          research and development (R&D) program, ORNL is collaborating with          General Atomics Company to produce TRISO fuel, a type of fuel similar          to what ORNL researchers developed for HTGRs and what is now proposed          for GT-MHRs and PBMRs. The work, led by David Williams of NSTD, involves          find-ing the best ways to produce uranium-oxide and plutonium-oxide kernels,          using an internal gelation process similar to the sol-gel process developed          years ago at ORNL, and to coat them to prevent the escape of the particle          fuels fission products. The coatings deposited on the kernels consist          of pyrolytic carbon, silicon carbide, and a porous carbon buffer. The          resulting product resembles black beads the size of salt grains.         The goal is to create fuel          beads that allow reactors to operate at higher temperatures so that they          can more efficiently convert their heat to electricity. The coated fuel          should also be meltdown proof—that is, it should act as a miniature          containment system that would prevent the release of fission products          to the environment during a highly unlikely loss-of-coolant accident.                                                                 These              micrographs show the structure of the coatings of TRISO-coated particles              incorporated into pebbles for the proposed pebble-bed modular reactor.              ORNL researchers have developed coatings for nuclear-fuel particles              that better contain the radioactive fission products within the particles.                           TRISO fuel would also be used          in the Advanced High Temperature Reactor, a long-term concept being developed          at ORNL under the leadership of NSTDs Charles Forsberg. Using molten          salts as a coolant, this highly efficient, power-producing reactor would          deliver heat at a high enough temperature to produce hydrogen from water          more cheaply than electrolysis. Hydrogen will be used for automotive and          building fuel cells.         ORNL researchers recently          helped design and manage a nonproliferation program to test mixed-oxide          (MOX) reactor fuel fabricated from depleted uranium and plutonium extracted          from both U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons. Now, we are helping the Russians          design and build a MOX fuel fabrication plant to provide fuel for Russian          fast reactors, Michaels says. We are also assisting DOE and industry          in preparing MOX fuel for use in four U.S. commercial reactors.         ADVANCED          MATERIALS FOR REACTORS         In a reactor, neutrons and          heat must be controlled, Michaels explains. Materials used to construct          reactors must survive neutron irradiation and heat and still have the          right properties to allow reactors to be run at higher temperatures. You          must get heat out of the reactor and take it to where you want it to produce          power. Toward that end, we are developing advanced materials for future          reactors.         Modern ferritic and other          steels have been developed for use in advanced reactors operating at temperatures          of up to about 600°C. If the operating temperature were raised 200°C          to increase reactor thermal efficiency, these materials would become deformed          and eventually rupture. ORNL and Japanese researchers recently discovered          that a high density of oxygen-rich clusters uniformly dispersed in steel          can greatly reduce its deformation up to 800°C, making this modified          alloy suitable for higher-temperature applications. ORNL and French researchers          are conducting further research in this area in projects funded by ORNLs          Laboratory Directed R&D (LDRD) program and DOEs International Nuclear          Energy Research Initiative program. According to ORNLs David Hoelzer,          who leads the LDRD project, modified steels could revolutionize the future          development of gas-cooled reactors.         Michaels says the United States          needs to both attract more American students into nuclear engineering          and improve the countrys nuclear infrastructure by building advanced          reactors, reprocessing plants, and uranium enrichment facilities. Otherwise,          he says, we risk becoming dependent on foreign nations for nuclear technology.          It would not help our nations energy security if we become a nuclear          know-nothing. Fortunately, DOE has a program that aims to revive nuclear          engineering as a hot field.

Scope         This section describes guidelines     for microscopical examinations employed in forensic fiber characterization,     identification, and comparison. Several types of light microscopes     are used including stereobinocular, polarized light, comparison,     fluorescence, and interference. In certain instances, the scanning     electron microscope yields additional information. The nature     and extent of the fiber evidence will dictate which tests or     techniques are selected and performed.           2.0.

Terminology         Anisotropic:  An object that has properties that     differ according to the direction of measurement when viewed     in polarized light.         Barrier Filter:  A filter used in fluorescence microscopy     that suppresses unnecessary excitation light that has not been     absorbed by the fiber and selectively transmits only the fluorescence.         Becke Line:  The bright halo near the boundary     of a fiber that moves with respect to that boundary as the microscope     is focused through best focus.         Becke Line Method:  A method for determining the refractive     index of a fiber relative to its mountant by noting the direction     in which the Becke line moves when the focus is changed. The     Becke line will always move toward the higher refractive index     medium (fiber or mountant) when focus is raised and will move     toward the lower refractive index medium when focus is lowered.         Birefringence:  The numerical difference in refractive     indices for a fiber, given by the formula: n ll      - n ^ . Birefringence can be calculated     by determining the retardation (r) and thickness (T) at a particular     point in a fiber and by using the formula: B = r (nm)/1,000 T     ( m m).         Comparison Microscope:  A system of two microscopes positioned     side by side and connected via an optical bridge in which specimens     are examined simultaneously in either transmitted or reflected     light.         Compensator:  Any variety of optical devices that     can be placed in the light path of a polarizing microscope to     introduce fixed or variable retardation comparable with that     exhibited by the fiber. The retardation and sign of elongation     of the fiber is then determined. Compensators can employ a fixed     mineral plate of constant or varying thickness or a mineral plate     that is rotated to alter the thickness presented to the optical     path (and retardation introduced) by a set amount.         Compensator, Full Wave     (Red Plate):  A compensator     using a plate of gypsum, selenite, or quartz, which introduces     a fixed retardation between 530-550 nm (approximately the retardation     of the first order red color on the Michel-Lévy chart).         Compensator, Quarter Wave:  A compensator, usually with a mica     plate, which introduces a fixed retardation between 125-150 nm.         Compensator, Quartz Wedge:  A wedge, cut from quartz, having     continuously variable retardation extending over several orders     of interference colors (usually 3-7).         Compensator, Sénarmont:  A quarter-wave plate inserted above     the specimen in the parallel 0"" position with a rotating     calibrated analyzer. Measures low retardation and requires the     use of monochromatic light.         Compensator, Tilting (Berek):  A compensator typically containing     a plate of calcite or quartz, which can be rotated by means of     a calibrated drum to introduce variable retardation up to about     ten orders.         Cortex:  The main structural component of     hair consisting of elongated and fusiform (spindle-shaped) cells.     The cortex contains pigment grains, air spaces called cortical     fusi, and structures called ovoid bodies.         Crimp:  The waviness of a fiber.         Cross-Over Marks:  Oblique flattened areas along silk     fibers caused by the overlapping of extruded silk fibers before     they have dried completely.         Cuticle:  The layer of scales composing the     outer surface of a hair shaft. Cuticular scales are normally     classified into three basic types: coronal (crown-like), spinous     (petal-like), and imbricate (flattened).         Delustrant:  A pigment, usually titanium dioxide, used     to dull the luster of a manufactured fiber.         Dichroism:  The property of exhibiting different     colors, especially two different colors, when viewed in polarized     light along different axes.         Dislocations:  Concerning natural fibers (e.g.,     flax, ramie, jute, and hemp) where distinct features in the shape     of X's, I's, and V's are present along the fiber cell wall. These     features are often useful for identification.         Dispersion of Birefringence:  The variation of birefringence with     wavelength of light. When dispersion of birefringence is significant     in a particular fiber, anomalous interference colors not appearing     in the regular color sequence of the Michel-Lévy chart     may result. Strong dispersion of birefringence also interferes     with the accurate determination of retardation in highly birefringent     fibers.         Dispersion Staining:  A technique for refractive index     determination that employs central or annular stops placed in     the objective back focal plane of a microscope. Using an annular     stop with the substage iris closed, a fiber mounted in a high-dispersion     medium will show a colored boundary of a wavelength where the     fiber and the medium match in refractive index. Using a central     stop, the fiber will show colors complimentary to those seen     with an annular stop.         Dyes:  Soluble substances that add color     to textiles. Dyes are classified into groups that have similar     chemical characteristics (e.g., aniline, acid, and azo). They     are incorporated into the fiber by chemical reaction, absorption,     or dispersion.         Excitation Filter:  A filter used in fluorescence microscopy     that transmits specific bands or wavelengths of energy capable     of inducing visible fluorescence in various substrates.         Inorganic Fibers:  A class of fibers of natural mineral     origin (e.g., chrysotile asbestos) and manmade mineral origin     (e.g., fiberglass).         Interference Colors:  Colors produced by the interference     of two out-of-phase rays of white light when a birefringent material     is observed at a nonextinction position between crossed polars.     The retardation at a particular point in a birefringent fiber     is determined by comparing the observed interference color to     the Michel-Lévy chart.         Isotropic:  An object that is identical in all     directions and invariant with respect to direction.         Light Microscope:  A microscope that employs light     in the visible or near-visible portion of the electromagnetic     spectrum.         Lignin:  The majority noncarbohydrate portion     of wood. It is an amorphous polymeric substance that cements     cellulosic fibers together. The principal constituent of woody     cell walls.        Lumen: The cavity or central canal present in many natural fibers     (e.g., cotton, flax, ramie, jute, and hemp). Its presence and     structure are often a useful aid in identification.         Luster:  The gloss or shine possessed by     a fiber, resulting from its reflection of light. The luster of     manufactured fibers is often modified by use of a delustering     pigment.         Manufactured Fiber:  A class name for various families     of fibers produced from fiber-forming substances, which are synthesized     polymers, modified or transformed natural polymers, and glass.         Medulla:  The central portion of a hair composed     of a series of discrete cells or an amorphous spongy mass. It     may be air-filled and, if so, will appear opaque or black using     transmitted light or white using reflected light. In animal hair,     several types have been defined: uniserial or multiserial ladder,     cellular or vacuolated, and lattice.         Michel-Lévy Chart:  A chart relating thickness, birefringence,     and retardation so that any one of these variables can be determined     for an anisotropic fiber when the other two are known.         Microscopical:  Concerning a microscope or the use     of a microscope.         Modification Ratio:  A geometrical parameter used in     the characterization of noncircular fiber cross sections. The     modification ratio is the ratio in size between the outside diameter     of the fiber and the diameter of the core. It is also called     aspect ratio.         Natural Fibers:  A class name of fibers of vegetable     origin (e.g., cotton, flax, and ramie), animal origin (e.g.,     silk, wool, and specialty furs), or of mineral origin (e.g.,     asbestos).         Pigment:  A finely divided insoluble material     used to deluster or color fibers (e.g., titanium dioxide and     iron oxide).         Plane Polarized Light:  Light that is vibrating in one     plane.         Pleochroism:  The property of exhibiting different     colors, especially three different colors, when viewed in polarized     light along different axes.         Polarized Light:  A bundle of light rays with a single     propagation direction and a single vibration direction. The vibration     direction is always perpendicular to the propagation direction.     It is produced by use of a polarizing filter, from ordinary light     by reflection, or double refraction in a suitable pleochroic     substance.         Polarized Light Microscope:  A microscope equipped with two polarizing     filters, one below the stage (the polarizer) and one above the     stage (the analyzer).         Privileged Direction (of     a Polarizer):  The     direction of vibration to which light emerging from a polarizer     has been restricted.         Refractive Index:  For a particular transparent medium,     the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light     in that medium.         Relative Refractive Index:  The estimate of the refractive index     of a fiber in relation to the index of its surrounding medium.         Retardation (r):  The actual distance of one of the     doubly refracted rays behind the other as they emerge from an     anisotropic fiber. Dependent upon the difference in the two refractive     indices, n2 – n1, and the thickness of the fiber.         Sign of Elongation:  Referring to the elongation of a     fiber in relation to refractive indices. If elongated in the     direction of the high refractive index, the fiber is said to     be positive, and if elongated in the direction of the low refractive     index, it is said to be negative.         Spherulites:  Spheres composed of needles or rods     all oriented perpendicular to the outer surface or a plane section     through such a sphere. A common form of polymer crystallization     from melts or concentrated solutions.         Stereomicroscope:  A microscope containing two separate     optical systems, one for each eye, giving a stereoscopic view     of a specimen.         Surface Dye:  A colorant bound to the surface     of a fiber.         Synthetic Fibers:  A class of manufactured polymeric     fibers that are synthesized from chemical compounds (e.g., nylon     and polyester).         Technical Fiber:  A bundle of natural fibers composed     of individual elongated cells that can be physically or chemically     separated and examined microscopically for identifying characteristics     (e.g., hemp, jute, and sisal).         Thermoplastic Fiber:  A synthetic fiber that will soften     or melt at high temperatures and harden again when cooled.         Thickness (T):  The optical path through the fiber     used for the calculation of birefringence, typically measured     in micrometers.           Back to the top           4.0.          Summary of Microscopy Guidelines         Textile fibers are examined     microscopically. They are mounted on glass microscope slides     in a mounting medium under a cover slip. The fibers are then     examined microscopically with a combination of various illumination     sources, filters, and instrumentation attached to a microscope     to determine their polymer type and record any microscopic characteristics.     Known and questioned fibers are then compared to determine if     they exhibit the same microscopic characteristics and optical     properties.           Back to the top           5.0. Significance          and Use         Microscopic examination provides     the quickest, most accurate, and least destructive means of determining     the microscopic characteristics and polymer type of textile fibers.     Additionally, a point-by-point and side-by-side microscopic comparison     provides the most discriminating method of determining if two     or more fibers are consistent with originating from the same     source. These guidelines require specific pieces of instrumentation     outlined herein.           Back to the top           6.0. Sample Handling         6.1. Preparing Samples       Items of evidence     are visually inspected, and tweezers are used to remove fibers     of interest. Simple magnifiers and stereomicroscopes, with a     variety of illumination techniques, may also be employed. Other     methods such as tape lifting or gentle scraping are usually conducted     after a visual examination. Tape lifts should be placed on clear     plastic sheets, glass microscope slides, or another uncontaminated     substrate that eases the search and removal of selected fibers.     Do not overload the tapes. The tape lifts or any material recovered     from scraping should be examined with a stereomicroscope, and     fibers of interest should be isolated for further analysis. Fibers     on tape lifts are removed using tweezers, other microscopic tools,     and solvents (1-6). Tape should not be attached to paper or cardboard.         6.2. Avoiding Contamination      Take care to ensure contamination does not occur. This must be     accomplished by examining questioned and known items in separate     areas, at different times, or both. The work area and tools must     be thoroughly cleaned and inspected before examining items that     are to be compared.           Back to the top           7.0. Analysis         7.1. Microscopy      Fibers should be first examined with a stereomicroscope. Physical     features such as crimp, length, color, relative diameter, luster,     apparent cross section, damage, and adhering debris should be     noted. Fibers are then tentatively classified into broad groups     such as synthetic, natural, or inorganic. If the sample contains     yarns, threads, or sections of fabric, construction should be     recorded (7-9).         7.1.1. Side-by-Side Comparisons.  If all of the characteristics are     the same under the stereoscope, the next step is to examine the     fibers with a comparison microscope. This side-by-side and point-by-point     examination is the best technique to discriminate between fibers,     especially those that appear to be similar. The physical characteristics     of the fibers (see subsection 7.3) must be compared visually     with the comparison microscope to determine if they are the same     in the known and questioned samples. Photography is recommended     to capture the salient features for later demonstration.         7.1.2. Illumination and     Magnification.  Comparisons     should be made under the same illumination conditions at the     same magnifications. For comparison microscopes, this requires     color balancing the light sources. This is best achieved with     two fibers or fiber samples from the same source mounted on two     microscope slides, which are then compared. The visual responses     from the two samples must be approximately the same color, brightness,     and clarity. A balanced neutral background color is optimal.         7.2. Fiber Mounts      Many suitable media are available as temporary and permanent     fiber mounts. The choice of mountant depends on availability,     the particular application, and examiner preference. However,     the following certain criteria (5, 10-15) must be met:         7.2.1. Mounting Media.  An examiner should be aware of the     possible deleterious effects that a mounting medium (especially     solvent-based media) has on textile fibers, particularly when     mounted for a long time. It is preferable that the mounted fibers     that were previously examined microscopically be used for chemical     analysis. If fibers must be removed for further testing, the     mounting medium should be removed with a solvent that will not     affect the structure or composition of the fiber.         7.2.2. Consistency of     Mountants.  Fibers     that are to be compared microscopically must be mounted in a     mounting medium. The same mountant should be used for both questioned     and known fibers.         7.2.3. Indexing Mountants.  If a solvent-based mounting medium     is used for refractive index (q.v.) determination, the index     of the mountant should be checked periodically against solid     refractive index standards and, if necessary, readjusted to its     proper value by the addition of solvent (16). Additionally, the     refractive index of the medium can be measured directly, and     the value can be recorded by the examiner. If such a medium is     used for permanent mounts, the examiner should be aware of the     different refractive indices for the fluid medium and the resin     after solvent evaporation.         7.2.4. Using Liquids.  Liquids used for exact refractive     index determinations should be known to within +0.0005 refractive     index units at n D . To make appropriate temperature     corrections, values for the temperature coefficient (dn/dt) for     each liquid and a thermometer covering the range 20-30°C,     calibrated in tenths of a degree, should be available. High dispersion     liquids (V < 30) are desirable for dispersion staining and     the Becke line method (17). Cargille refractive index liquids     are suitable for this purpose and are recommended for refractive     index measurements of fibers.         7.3. Physical Characteristics of Manufactured     Fibers         7.3.1. Fiber Diameter.  The diameter of circular fibers     can be measured using a calibrated eyepiece graticule. Noncircular     fibers require special considerations (18). If fiber diameters     are not uniform within a sample, a determination of the range     of diameters exhibited by the sample is recommended.         7.3.2. Fiber Color.  Color can be uniform along the length     of a fiber, or it can vary. Variation in color between fibers     in a sample should be recorded. The examiner should be able to     distinguish between dyed, surface-dyed, and pigmented fibers.         7.3.3. Delustrant Particles.  The presence or absence of delustrant     particles is a useful comparative feature. If present, the size,     shape, distribution, relative abundance, and general appearance     should be noted. Delustrant particles, although not indicative     of any particular generic fiber type, can be characteristic of     end-use properties needed by a manufacturer. Also, delustrants     serve to eliminate all but manufactured fibers.         7.3.4. Cross-Sectional     Shape.  When viewed     longitudinally on glass slides in a suitable mountant, the apparent     cross-sectional shape of fibers can often be determined by slowly     focusing through the fiber (optical sectioning). Actual fiber     cross sections provide the best information on cross-sectional     shape. (See section 8.1)         7.3.5. Fiber Surface Characteristics.  Record fiber surface characteristics     such as manufacturing striations, damage, and surface debris     (e.g., droplets, blood, or other foreign material). Surface striations     are more apparent in a mounting medium of refractive index significantly     different from those of the fiber (7).         7.4. Physical Characteristics of Natural     Fibers         7.4.1. Physical Features.  Color, diameter, and miscellaneous     physical features described previously should be noted for natural     fibers. The following characteristics should also be noted.         7.4.2. Morphological Features     of Animal Hairs.      The principal morphological features of animal hairs are the     root, medulla, cortex, and cuticle. Shield size and subshield     strictures are also useful traits for species identification.     Medullary and cortical structures are best observed on hairs     mounted on a slide with a suitable mounting medium. Cuticular     scales are best observed on replicas cast in a transparent polymer     (scale casts). Scale counts (scales per 100 micrometers) can     help distinguish specialty fur fibers (19-22). Silk, a protein     fiber produced by caterpillars, has morphological features that     differ from animal hairs. Some features of silk include crossover     marks and a wedge to triangular cross section with rounded corners.     In textiles, silk is occasionally seen as paired fibers cemented     together, but it is most often found as single fibers (23).         7.4.3. Plant Fibers.  Plant fibers can be encountered     as the technical fiber (cordage, sacks, and mats) or as individual     cells (fabrics and paper). The examination of technical fibers     should include a search for epidermal tissue and crystals and     the preparation of a cross section. Additionally, a chemical     test for lignin may be performed. Technical fibers should be     macerated, fabrics teased apart, and paper repulped for the examination     of individual cells. Relative thickness of cell walls and lumen,     cell length, and the presence, type, and distribution of dislocations     should be noted. The direction of twist of the cellulose in the     cell wall can also be determined (24). Other characteristic cells     should be noted and compared to authentic specimens (25-27).         7.5. Physical Characteristics of Inorganic     Fibers         7.5.1 Asbestos Minerals.  Mineral fibers are commonly called     asbestos, which is a general term for many naturally occurring     fibrous hydrated silicate minerals. The asbestos minerals include     chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, fibrous tremolite/actinolite,     and fibrous anthophyllite. Chrysotile belongs to the serpentine     group of minerals that are layer silicates. The other asbestos     minerals are amphiboles and are classified as chain silicates.     Asbestos fibers alone or mixed with other components occur in     building materials and insulation products. Chrysotile is the     only asbestos mineral that would be encountered as a woven fabric,     but any of the asbestos minerals are found in pressed sheets     such as gaskets. Take care when analyzing asbestos fibers because     they are considered a potential health hazard.         All asbestos minerals can     be easily identified by their optical properties using polarized     light microscopy. Although not considered essential, the dispersion     staining technique is extremely helpful (28-29). Scanning electron     microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry can also be used     to characterize the asbestos minerals. Nonmicroscopical techniques     for asbestos identification include X-ray diffraction and infrared     spectroscopy.         Glass fibers are often encountered     in building materials and insulation products. Glass fibers are     also called manmade vitreous fibers (30). On the basis of the     starting materials used to produce glass fibers, they can be     placed into three categories: fiberglass (continuous and noncontinuous),     mineral wool (rock wool and slag wool), and refractory ceramic     fibers (glass ceramic fibers). Single crystal and polycrystalline     refractory fibers such as aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, zirconium     oxide, and carbon are not included because they are not considered     glass fibers.         Light microscopy is used,     together with classical immersion methods, to determine the refractive     index for the classification and comparison of glass fibers.     The dispersion staining technique is used when determining the     refractive index and variation of the refractive index within     a sample. Determination and comparison of the refractive index     of noncontinuous (fiberglass) wool, rock wool, and slag wool     can also be accomplished by annealing the fibers and using the     double variation method (31-33). Solubility tests using 10 percent     HCl should be conducted and the results noted. A binder resin     that fluoresces under UV light may also be present on some glass     wool products.         Scanning electron microscopy     with energy dispersive spectrometry is used to provide elemental     composition. Elemental ratios are used for comparison purposes.     It is necessary to eliminate any absorption effects when acquiring     the energy dispersive spectrum. Otherwise, artificial variation     in the elemental composition is introduced (34).         7.6. Optical Characteristics         Detailed discussions of optical     characteristics are provided by McCrone (35-38), McCrone, McCrone,     and Delly (18), Bloss (39), Chamot and Mason (40), Hartshorne     and Stuart (41), and Stoiber and Morse (42).         7.6.1. Refractive Index.  The refractive index, n, of a transparent     material is n = (speed of light in a vacuum)/(speed of light     in the material). All transparent fibers other than glass display     two principle refractive indices, one for light polarized parallel     to the long axis of the fiber (n ll ) and one for light polarized perpendicular     to the long axis of the fiber (n ^ ). For fibers examined in unpolarized     light, a third quantity, n iso  (defined as 1/3[2 n ^      + n ll ]), may also be estimated. Because     refractive index varies with wavelength and temperature, a standard     refractive index (n), is defined for all transparent materials     as the refractive index at a wavelength of 589 nm (the D line     of sodium) at 25°C.         The refractive indices of     a fiber are determined by several methods. Whatever the method     used, determination of n ll  and n ^  should be made using plane polarized     light with the fiber aligned parallel and perpendicular to the     privileged direction of the polarizer, respectively. The vibration     direction of the polarizer should coincide with the horizontal     line of the eyepiece graticule.         Refractive index measurements     are either relative or exact. A relative refractive index measurement     involves (a) determining whether an immersed object is higher     or lower in refractive index than the immersion medium and (b)     estimating the approximate refractive index on the basis of amount     of contrast between the fiber and the medium. The contrast shows     the amount of difference between the fiber and the medium. Exact     numerical values for n ll  and n ^  of a fiber (at 589 nm at 25°C)     can be determined by the Becke line method or by dispersion staining.     Measurements using these methods have a precision of ±0.001     (18).         For a fiber displaying two     refractive indices, birefringence is defined as |n ll  - n ^ |. Birefringence is determined measuring     n ll  and n ^  and using the previous formula or     by determining the retardation with the corresponding thickness     of the fiber and calculated with the following formula:      Retardation (nm)/Birefringence = 1,000 × Thickness ( m m)         The retardation can be estimated     by observing the interference color displayed at the point where     the thickness of the fiber is measured and by comparing it to     the Michel-Lévy chart. Take care when interpreting results     from deeply dyed fibers, as the dye can obscure the interference     colors. A wedge slice through the fiber; the use of various compensators     such as the Sénarmont, quartz wedge, and tilting (Berek);     or both can be used to make a more accurate determination of     retardation (43). When measuring retardation of a fiber using     a tilting compensator or quartz wedge, one must assure no error     has been introduced because of differences in dispersion of birefringence     between the compensator and the fiber (44). This is of special     concern with the examination of fibers with high birefringence.     The birefringence of noncircular fibers is estimated by measuring     both retardation and thickness at two points along the fiber     that represent their highest and lowest values (45).         7.6.2. Birefringence.  For a birefringent fiber, the sign     of elongation is positive (+) if n ll  > n ^  and negative (-) if n ll  < n ^ . It should be noted that all common     manufactured fibers with a birefringence higher than 0.010 have     a positive sign of elongation. Full- or quarter-wave compensators     are commonly used to make this determination for fibers with     low birefringence (5, 39).         7.6.3. Pleochroism.  Pleochroism (or dichroism) is the     differential absorption of light by an object when viewed at     different orientations relative to the vibration direction of     plane polarized light. Certain dyed fibers and some mineral fibers     may exhibit pleochroism.         7.6.4. Fluorescence.  Fluorescence is the emission of     light of a certain wavelength by an object when excited by light     of a shorter wavelength (higher energy). Fluorescence may arise     from fibers themselves or from dyes and other additives. Fibers     should be mounted in a low- to-nonfluorescent medium to observe     fluorescence. Examination using various combinations of excitation     and barrier filters is desirable. At each excitation wavelength,     the color and intensity or absence of fluorescence emission should     be noted (5, 7, 46-50).         7.7. Miscellaneous Techniques         7.7.1. Preparing Cross     Sections.  Physical     cross sections from fibers as short as 1 mm can be prepared.     Manufactured and vegetable fibers may be sectioned anywhere along     their length (54-59). Animal hairs may be sectioned to yield     additional identifying characteristics (60-61). When observing     manufactured fiber cross sections, the general shape and distribution     of delustrant, pigment particles, or both; the presence and size     of spherulites or voids; depth of dye penetration; and surface     treatments should be recorded when present. The fiber dimensions     measured from a cross section can be used for the calculation     of birefringence and the determination of the modification ratio     of multilobed fibers.         7.7.2. Solubility Testing.  Solubility is a destructive method.     Solubility testing can, however, provide supplemental information     to nondestructive methods. Possible reactions of fibers to solvents     include partial and complete solubility, swelling, shrinking,     gelling, and color change. If solubility tests are used as part     of an identification scheme, appropriate controls should be run     following the laboratory's quality assurance and control guidelines     for a lot or batch of reagents or solvents. It is desirable to     view known and questioned fibers simultaneously when comparing     their solubilities (5, 62-64).         7.7.3. Heat Effects.  A polarized light microscope equipped     with a hot stage is recommended for observations of the effect     of heat on thermoplastic fibers. Using slightly uncrossed polars,     one may observe droplet formation, contraction, softening, charring,     and melting of fibers over a range of temperatures. These observations,     including melting temperature or temperatures, should be recorded.     Because manufactured fibers are composed of mixtures of chemical     compounds rather than pure polymers and are a combination of     crystalline and amorphous regions, changes are observed over     a temperature range rather than at a single melting point (5,     7, 65-69). Fibers should be mounted in an inert, heat-resistant     medium, such as a high-temperature-stable silicone oil, to ensure     reproducible melting behavior (70-71). Accurate and reproducible     results are best obtained using a heating rate of no greater     than 1-2°C/minute when near the initial melting temperature.     The hot stage should be calibrated using appropriate standards,     following established guidelines. The recommended melting point     apparatus should be adjustable for temperatures from ambient     to at least 300°C, in increments of 0.1°C, and should     allow a heating rate of as low as 1°C/minute (72-79).         7.7.4. Fiber Surface Morphology.      Scanning electron     microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) is used     as an imaging and microanalytical tool in the characterization     of fibers. Fiber surface morphology can be examined with great     depth of field at continually variable magnifications. Fibers,     prepared cross sections, or both are mounted to a specimen stub     and may be conductively coated to prevent possible electron beam     charging. The use of a suitable calibration standard is recommended     for the accurate measurement of fiber cross sections.         Applications of SEM-EDS to     fiber analysis include the characterization of fiber cross sections,     identification of pigments and delustrants by elemental analysis,     fiber damage due to cuts and tears (51-53, 80-82), trace debris     on fibers, surface feature modifications such as washer/dryer     abrasion (83), and acid-washed treatment of denim garments (84).     Authors have examined fiber bonding in nonwoven fabrics and shrink-proofing     treatment of wool (85). Surface imaging using the SEM-EDS as     an aid in the identification of animal hair-scale structure has     been reported (86).           Back to the top           8.0. Report          Documentation         The examiner's analytical     notes should reflect the particular characteristics used in the     microscopic comparison, especially any calculated values, descriptions,     diagrams, or photographs. A positive association is when the     questioned and known fibers exhibit the same microscopic characteristics     and optical properties in all tested parameters and are therefore     consistent with originating from the same source. A negative     association is when the questioned and known fibers are different     in some significant aspect and are therefore from separate sources.     An inconclusive result indicates that no conclusion could be     reached, and some explanation is required as to why a definitive     conclusion was not possible.

Geological Survey  In Roman mythology, Vulcan, the god of fire, was said to have made tools and weapons for the other gods in his workshop at Olympus. Throughout history, volcanoes have frequently been identified with Vulcan and other mythological figures. Scientists now know that the ""smoke"" from volcanoes, once attributed by poets to be from Vulcan's forge, is actually volcanic gas naturally released from both active and many inactive volcanoes. The molten rock, or magma, that lies beneath volcanoes and fuels eruptions, contains abundant gases that are released to the surface before, during, and after eruptions. These gases range from relatively benign low-temperature steam to thick hot clouds of choking sulfurous fume jetting from the earth. Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other volcanic gases are hydrogen sulfide, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrofluoric acid, and other trace gases and volatile metals. The concentrations of these gas species can vary considerably from one volcano to the next.  WHY STUDY VOLCANIC GAS? A famous Japanese geochemist, Sadao Matsuo, once said that ""Volcanic gas is a telegram from the earth's interior."" By studying volcanic gases, volcanologists hope to recognize changes in abundance or composition that might signal reawakening of a dormant volcano or portend an imminent eruption at an already restless volcano. Another significant component of volcanic gas research involves measuring the quantities of gas that volcanoes release to the atmosphere. Huge amounts of volcanic gas, aerosol droplets, and ash are injected into the stratosphere during major explosive eruptions. Some gases, such as carbon dioxide, contribute to global warming, while others, like sulfur dioxide, can cause global cooling and ozone destruction. Studies of volcanic emissions will allow scientists to compare volcanic gas output to emissions from man-made sources and to assess the effects of both past and future eruptions on Earth's climate.  S. U.  R EO LOGIC AL SU  Volcanic Gas IS VOLCANIC GAS HAZARDOUS? Yes, volcanic gas can be harmful to humans, animals, plants, agricultural crops, and property. Usually, the hazards from volcanic gases are restricted to the areas immediately surrounding volcanic vents and fumaroles and to low spots on the flanks of volcanoes. But these hazards sometimes persist for long distances downwind from a volcano. Health hazards can range from minor to life threatening. Exposure to acid gases such as sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrochloric acid can damage eyes and mucous membranes along with the respiratory system and, under extreme conditions, can lead to death. The toxicity of carbon monoxide is well Stratosphere Photochemistry Injection SO2 Ash CO2 HF  hv OH  Albedo  Heterochemistry HNO3 N2 O5 ClONO2 HCl ClO O3  Dispersion  SO2  H2SO4  HCl Nucleation  Condensation, Coagulation Cirrus Nucleation  Sedimentation, Circulation  Acid Rain  Troposphere  Figure 1. Large volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) into the stratosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming. HCl and HF can dissolve in water and fall to the earth as acid rain. Most of the SO2 is slowly converted to sulfuric acid (H2SO4) which condenses into a mist of fine particles. These sulfate aerosols reflect radiation from the Sun, cooling the troposphere; they also absorb the Earth's heat, warming the stratosphere. The aerosols also promote ozone destruction by altering chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere. As the aerosols settle down into the upper troposphere, they can serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds, further affecting the Earth's radiation balance. (figure modified from Richard Turco in American Geophysical Union Special Report: Volcanism and Climate Change, May 1992).   short-term releases of gas that will usually be missed by occasional sampling. Finally, emissions of certain gases can be measured in the plume discharging from a volcano. Scientists use an optical spectrometer mounted in an airplane and flown through or beneath a volcanic plume or in a satellite measuring the plume from space. This equipment provides a measure of the total output of one or more gases and is useful in understanding how much volcanic gas is released into the atmosphere.  WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? Studies by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have revealed the compositions and amounts of gases released from several active volcanoes in the U.S. (Alaska, Cascades, Hawaii). As an example, USGS scientists studying the gases of Mount St. Helens have determined that about 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide were emitted between 1980 and 1988. Sensors aboard a satellite detected about 1 million tons of sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere during the main eruption on May 18, 1980. Another half-million tons of sulfur dioxide was dissolved in water droplets attached to ash particles that eventually fell to earth. The remaining half-million tons was emitted from the volcano during the eight years following the initial eruption. These measurements allow important comparisons with sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants and other man-made sources. Careful study of Mount St. Helens' gases using chemical sensors installed on the dome along with airborne measurements of sulfur dioxide revealed periods of increased gas emission prior to four dome-building eruptions during 1984-86. This observation is an important first step in developing the ability to predict eruptions by monitoring gases. In summary, the study of volcanic gases contributes important new information related to global climate change and may lead to the development of an effective tool for predicting volcanic eruptions.

One of the most serious hazards occurs when volcanoes emit large quantities of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and collects in low spots, displacing air in these locations. Hundreds of people have died of carbon dioxide asphyxiation near volcanoes in the past two decades, most of them in Cameroon, Africa, and in Indonesia. Volcanic gases can also severely damage vegetation. Direct exposure to concentrated volcanic gas or long-term exposure to dilute volcanic gas has a lethal effect on most types of foliage. Fume clouds from volcanoes also contain water droplets in which acid gases have dissolved. These droplets eventually fall to earth as acid rain. Utility lines, farm equipment, cars, and other metal objects corrode when exposed to volcanic gases or acid rain. Persistent acid rain causes galvanized nails or lead solder in water catchment systems to deteriorate and release heavy metals into drinking water. Hydrofluoric acid gas emitted from a volcano can attach itself to ash particles. When these particles fall to earth, there can be serious consequences if ingested by grazing animals.  HOW ARE VOLCANIC GASES STUDIED? Customarily, gases are collected directly from volcanic fumaroles (vents), then transported to an analytical laboratory for detailed chemical analysis. A new approach involves installing chemical sensors in or near volcanic vents and linking them to radio telemetry devices to provide a continuous readout on one or more gases. This method can detect significant"

While the color issue has received considerable              attention, more recently heavy metals (copper and chromium in particular)              found in some dyes, and the toxicity of organics formed by the degradation              of dyes and dye auxiliaries are being considered within the framework              of pretreatment regulations. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection              Agency (EPA) is attempting to reduce the hazards associated with waste              sludges disposed of in landfill sites through the requirements of              the Toxicity Characteristics Leachate Procedure (TCLP). Metals such              as chromium and selected organics, including some acknowledged dye              breakdown products, e.g., aromatic amines, are the focus of concern.              Additionally, under federal mandate, states are establishing stream              water quality standards which will tighten National Pollution Discharge              Elimination System (NPDES) permits.                In this Phase I effort, two approaches were investigated to treat                textile effluents. The electrochemical treatment by anodic oxidation                using anodes with catalytic coatings effectively oxidized the dye                wastes. However, three industrial effluents tested generated chlorine                gas during anodic oxidation making the process, limited in it’s                applicability due to the possibility of forming chlorinated byproducts.                Cathodic treatment using electrochemically assisted Fenton’s reagent                also effectively oxidized the dye solutions. However, this method                required initial pH adjustment to between 2 and 4, before the electrochemical                step, making the process unattractive.                The other method tested using ion-exchanged zeolites together                with hydrogen peroxide, was a very attractive process. Several synthetic                zeolites and a natural zeolite were ion-exchanged with different                cations, e.g., Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II).                Out of the synthetic zeolites, Fe(II) exchanged ZSM-5 was superior.                Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, ion-exchanged with Fe(II) was                found to be even more effective than Fe(II)-exchanged ZSM-5. Since                the catalytic Fe(II) sites are bound to the zeolite structure, no                sludges are formed and the cations released to the solution during                organometallic dye degradation were found to absorbed by the zeolites.                Thus, toxic metals like copper or cobalt released during dye degradation                can be easily recovered using this process. Similarly, the process                is amenable to scale-up as packed columns of Fe(II)-exchanged zeolites                can be used for waste oxidation. Similarly, the toxic metals ion-exchanged                onto zeolites can be easily leached out using dilute acids. In addition,                it was also found that spent zeolite columns loaded with organic                dyes can be regenerated by using 30% hydrogen peroxide solutions.                This allows the effective regeneration of the columns.                The hydrogen peroxide decays to oxygen and water, so the entire                system is environmentally friendly. Zeolites are non-toxic aluminosilicates                and pose no disposal problems. Natural zeolites and the chemicals                required (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate) are inexpensive                making the process economical. All these advantages makes this advanced                non-photoassisted catalytic oxidation process using Fe(II)-exchanged                natural zeolites, a very attractive process for a variety of applications                in environmental remediation. The feasibility of this process has                been amply demonstrated to recommend further studies under a possible                follow-on Phase II project.

GX080-17-0395049	TEKTRAN   REGENERATION OF DYE-SATURATED QUATERNIZED CELLULOSE BY BISULFITE-MEDIATED BOROHYDRIDE REDUCTION OF DYE AZO GROUPS -- AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR DECOLORIZATION OF TEXTILE WASTEWATERS      Author(s):    LASZLO  JOSEPH A                           Interpretive Summary:      We showed previously that textile wastewater can be treated to remove       colored contaminants (dyes) using chemically-modified cellulose or          chemically-modified crop byproducts (which are composed of cellulose and    similar materials).  The wastewater dyes bind tightly to the modified       cellulose, which can then be filtered and removed.  However, because of the strong association between dye and modified cellulose, reuse of the         modified cellulose has not been feasible.  The present work describes a     simple chemical method by which the dye-binding ability of used, modified   cellulose can be restored.  A combination of strong reducing agents applied to the dye-cellulose complex breaks the dye into smaller molecules that are easily released from the cellulose.  This procedure is inexpensive and uses chemicals already employed in textile dyeing.  The findings of this work    will allow textile companies to treat their wastewater at reduced expense   by using the modified celluloses which can now be reused many times.

GX081-01-1452729	TEKTRAN   REGENERATION OF AZO-DYE-SATURATED CELLULOSIC ANION EXCHANGE RESIN BY BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA ANAEROBIC DYE REDUCTION      Author(s):    LASZLO  JOSEPH A                         Interpretive Summary:    There is a tremendous need to treat textile wastewaters cost                effectively.  Most conventional treatment methods remove the dyes that      contaminate these wastewaters inefficiently.  We previously devised a       technology that uses chemically modified biomass (plant residue matter)     to remove dyes from wastewater.  Now, to make this technology more cost     effective, we have developed a method that relies on bacteria to break      up the dye and allow the biomass to be used many times.  The natural        ability of certain bacteria to digest dyes when they lack oxygen was        harnessed for the task of cleaning off the dye from the biomass.  This      new procedure lessens the cost of regenerating the dye-binding capacity     of the biomass and minimizes the environmental impact of the process.       The technology can be incorporated into certain existing types of           wastewater treatment systems.  Engineers can use this information in the    design of new treatment facilities for textile mills.

GX092-54-6961727	TEKTRAN   SOLUBILITY AND DYE-BINDING PROPERTIES OF QUATERNIZED AND PEROXIDASE-POLYMERIZED KRAFT LIGNIN      Author(s):    LASZLO  JOSEPH A                           Interpretive Summary:      The textile industry is the most polluting of all industries worldwide,     considering both the volume and composition of the effluent discharged.     Treatments to remove dyes from textile wastewaters add significantly to     the cost of production of finished goods; costs which are passed along      to the consumer.  A new polymer, derived from a byproduct (kraft lignin)    of the pulp and paper industry, has been developed that can be used to      decolorize textile effluents.  This new polymer is simple to make,          employing just one chemical treatment step and one enzymatic treatment      step to prepare the material.  The simplicity and high efficiency of        this procedure compared to previously developed methods indicates that      the polymer can provide a cost-effective means to treat textile             wastewaters.

But that may change in the near future, at            least in the world of cotton processors, because of work being done            by chemical engineer Val Yachmenev and his colleagues at the  Agricultural            Research Service .                     Yachmenev, who works in the Cotton Textile Chemistry Research            Unit (CTCRU) at ARS' Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans,            Lousiana, has found that ultrasound can boost enzymatic activity during            several different types of treatments to cotton fibers.                     Enzymes are protein molecules that can speed up complex            chemical reactions. They act as catalysts—substances that start            or accelerate chemical reactions without themselves being affected.            Human saliva, for example, contains amylase, an enzyme that helps break            down starchy foods into sugars.                                                 ""Use of enzymes in the cotton industry has become            more popular in recent years,"" says Yachmenev, ""because scientists            have developed highly specific enzymes that perform textile-processing            tasks."" Enzymatic treatments have been used for a long time to            remove the starch size that's added to cotton yarns to smooth and protect            them from breaks during weaving. But new processing applications have            been developed for scouring (removing natural waxes, pectins, and fats            from the surface of cotton fibers), biofinishing (removing fiber fuzz            and pills from fabric surface), and biostoning (removing color and softening            denim fabrics for a stone-washed effect). Enzymes are also used in laundry            detergent, to remove fiber fuzz and various stains, and in bleach cleanup            after scouring to eliminate problems during the dyeing process.                     Yachmenev says that enzymes use significantly less water,            less energy, and fewer chemicals than traditional methods. In addition,            wastewater from enzymatic treatments is readily biodegradable and does            not pose an environmental threat.                     Gene Blanchard, CTCRU's research leader, describes differences            between traditional and enzymatic scouring methods: ""To scour cotton            fibers the old-fashioned way, you boil them in a highly alkaline solution            at temperatures of 100° C. Afterwards, you're left with alkaline            wastewater that must be neutralized with an acid or diluted with large            amounts of fresh water.                                                    ""If you use an enzymatic treatment,"" Blanchard            continues, ""you only have to heat the solution to about 50°            C for optimum enzyme performance. You don't expend as much energy, you            do less damage to the textile, and the resulting wastewater is biodegradable.""                     Although enzymatic processing offers many advantages,            there are a few drawbacks when compared to traditional methods—namely,            expensive processing costs and relatively slow reaction rates. ""These            drawbacks could impede widespread use of enzymes by the textile industry,""            says Yachmenev.                     But ultrasound technology may help make up for enzymatic            processing's shortcomings.            Yachmenev and his SRRC colleagues have found that introducing ultrasonic            energy during enzymatic treatments of cotton fabric significantly improves            enzyme efficiency without affecting the strength of the fabric.           It's In the Bubbles                     Ultrasound can be defined as sound waves with frequencies above 20,000            oscillations per second, which is above the upper limit of human hearing.            In liquid, these high-frequency waves cause the formation of microscopic            bubbles, or cavitation. They also cause insignificant heating of the            liquid.                     When fabric is placed in an enzymatic solution, enzyme molecules, which            are relatively large, make their way to the fabric and are adsorbed            onto the surface. The enzymatic reaction—biostoning, scouring,            etc.—occurs when the enzymes reach the place where solid and liquid            meet, the ""solid/liquid interface.""                     Although this seems like a straightforward process, it can take awhile            because of the enzymes' large size. Yachmenev says, ""These bulky            molecules don't move toward the interface very quickly. And their size            makes it hard for them to penetrate the nearly immobile layer of liquid            that sits right next to the fabric surface.""                     Yachmenev decided that the best way to accelerate the transport of            enzymes through this liquid barrier was to shake things up. He chose            ultrasound as his tool.                     ""Ultrasound causes cavitational bubbles to form in liquid. When            the bubbles collapse, they generate tiny but powerful shock waves. I            knew we needed to agitate the border layer of liquid to get the enzymes            through the barrier more quickly, and these shock waves seemed like            the perfect stirring mechanism,"" he says.                     Some scientists had speculated that ultrasonic energy would be too            powerful to use as a stirring tool—that it would tear apart the            large, yet fragile, enzyme molecules. To prevent this from happening,            Yachmenev and Blanchard diffused the ultrasound energy uniformly through            a solution with low enzyme concentrations.                     The experiment was a success. Enzymatic treatments supplemented with            ultrasonic energy resulted in shorter processing times, less consumption            of expensive enzymes, less fiber damage, and better uniformity of treatment            to the fabric.           Factory-Grade Ultrasound                     All of Yachmenev's experiments were conducted in a laboratory that            houses a small-scale ultrasound machine. Some textile manufacturers            have expressed interest in the technology, but they would need large,            industrial-grade equipment to achieve similar results at the mass-production            level. Unfortunately, most ultrasound manufacturers produce only smaller            machines for the medical and research communities.                     Yachmenev has contacted manufacturers from around the world trying            to generate interest. He says it would be a good investment because            the technology's usefulness isn't limited to just the textile industry.            ""It can be used to intensify enzymatic treatments in any solid/liquid            system,"" he says.                     ""For example, the paper industry would be an excellent candidate            for using ultrasound. Paper producers have had problems in the past            with meeting environmental standards, and they have been moving toward            enzymatic treatments. Ultrasound would make these treatments more cost-effective,""            says Yachmenev.                     ""I believe enzymatic treatments are the wave of the future,""            he continues. ""Governments worldwide are calling for a reduction            in the quantity and toxicity of wastewater, and using enzymes would            help factories and manufacturers achieve this goal. Ultrasound will            help them achieve it at lower costs.""

GX030-70-11974933	"MULTI-STATE PROJECT NO.: DC 00-01  (9/10/2001)       TITLE:  NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE UTILIZATION OF TEXTILE MATERIALS             DURATION:  October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2006        STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM       The U.S. textile industry is a world leader in manufacturing textiles,     employing more than 600,000 people in nearly every state and generating $69     billion annually (113). In order for the U.S. textile industry to maintain     its leadership and competitive edge while preserving the environment, new     technologies are needed to convert agricultural residues and by-products     into textile products and to enhance the technical performance of     conventional textiles for new consumer, medical and industrial applications.     This new millennium project focuses on expanding the uses for agricultural     commodities and by-products, investigating more environmentally friendly     methods for textile processing utilizing biotechnologies, and developing     novel, high performance textile products for specialty applications. The     research proposed herein is not duplicated by any of the other 139 Regional     Research Projects listed at     http://www.msstate.edu/org/saaesd/cris/reproj.htm; furthermore, NC-170     focuses primarily on protective clothing. It also is broader in scope and     compliments some of the related projects listed under the USDA-ARS program     area of  Quality and Utilization of Agricultural Products .       JUSTIFICATION         The textile industry today is concerned with five main interrelated     issues: procurement of raw materials, converting them into finished     products, meeting customer expectations, and human health/environmental     safety, and making a profit. Many of these issues parallel the priorities     developed by the ESCOP, e.g., the environment, sustainable production     systems, economies of rural communities, and consumer interests. There also     is a need to develop new materials and composites and new manufacturing     technologies for making textiles that are more “environmentally     friendly.” Finding alternative raw materials, synthetic pathways,     natural processes, and reaction conditions are central to EPA’s mission     and have been endorsed by former president Clinton since 1995.        Justification for Developing Value Added Products from     Renewable/Recyclable Resources       The U.S. agriculture accounts for -20% of the GNP through the production     of agricultural raw materials and products. The agriculture industry also     contributes $40 billion annually in exports with each billion resulting in     -30,000 jobs. However, oil imports continue to drain our economy and account     for -20% of our trade deficit. At the same time, the world's plant biomass     is about 2,000 billion tons, and the renewable resources amount to about 100     billion tons/year (68). Given the abundance of biomass feedstocks, the value     added to the U.S. economy, and potential reduction in the trade deficit, it     seems logical to pursue the use of biomass for production of materials and     chemicals. Furthermore, considering the four million tons of post-consumer     textiles waste generated annually, the rising cost of disposal, reduction in     available space, and increasing environmental concerns, research is     critically needed on innovative recycling technologies for textile wastes.       Since the introduction of nylon in the1940’s, synthetic fibers have     had a significant impact on the quality of our lives. However, the demand     for natural fibers continues to increase because of their many outstanding     properties, including aesthetics, comfort, and biodegradability. Research     efforts are refocusing on exploring alternative fiber crops, crop residues,     and agricultural by-products, which are often underutilized. For example,     kenaf fibers are environmentally friendly, easy to grow, and adaptable to     many soil types. AES scientists in AR, GA, LSU-LA, and TN (3, 13, 14, 28,     80, 90-92) are investigating kenaf because of its economic potential for     fiber producers as well as the cottage craft industries in AR and other     states with significant craft industry-based economies. However, before     kenaf can become a viable crop, new value-added products must be developed     to prove its versatility in the textile, apparel, and craft industries. Work     by scientists in AR, KS, and MS (18-20, 82-83) has resulted in the     production and manufacturing of a variety of kenaf products for both apparel     and home furnishing uses. Because of the worldwide interest in kenaf, hemp,     jute, and other alternative crops, work is needed to further enhance its     aesthetics and properties for a wider range of products through bleaching,     dyeing, and finishing. These research efforts will facilitate the use of     kenaf in various types of value added products for the craft industry.       Similarly, agricultural residues and by products from major U.S.     agricultural commodities (sugarcane, soybeans, wheat, corn, etc.) could be     used to produce a multitude of value-added non-food products, ranging from     fibers, films, plastics, and composites to resins, finishing agents, and     auxiliaries. Furthermore, many of the chemical compounds used for textile     wet processing are currently obtained from petrochemicals and could also be     derived from agri-chemicals.        Sugarcane is an important agricultural crop in LA and FL. FL producing     is the largest U.S. producer of sugarcane with a crop value of $472 billion     (53.2% of the total), followed by LA with a crop value of $287 billion     (30.4%). Most of the crushed stalks (bagasse) currently produced are used as     in-house fuels in mill processing and for other low value applications, such     as mulch and ceiling tiles (75). Development of value-added products from     the waste or low-value materials could allow mills to migrate to cleaner     burning fuels and provide economic benefits to sugarcane producers.     Researchers in LSU-LA have developed processes for converting bagasse into     textile and geotextile products (19-20). The development of higher     value-added products would create new uses and provide economic benefits for     both LA and FL.        About 22% of the textile fibers produced are used for industrial     applications, which includes low and high resin composites (113). However,     the abundance of recyclable fiber and agricultural residues, coupled with     the dwindling supply of some natural resources, have created the need to     develop alternative structural composites. Researchers in KS, NE, and LSU-LA     (30, 34, 39) have been exploring the use of agricultural residues and     byproducts from wheat, soybeans, and bagasse for textile applications and     low and high resin composites. Agri-plastics and composites appear to be the     most promising use for many of these crop residues. However, many challenges     exist in identifying market segments, determining performance requirements,     selecting resins, and optimizing manufacturing properties. Attempts to     manufacture agri-fiber composites have been impeded by finding suitable     resins that parallel the quality of wood-based particleboards made with     formaldehyde-based resins. Fundamental research is needed on evaluating the     flow properties and manufacturing conditions to maximize the use of     agri-plastics in toys and other consumer applications.       Work also is being done on making solvent- spun cellulosics from cheaper     raw materials, such as agricultural wastes (e.g., bagasse and wheat straw)     or post consumer cellulosic textiles (rayon and cotton and their blends).     Obtaining fiber-forming cellulose solutions (lyocell) from reclaimed     cellulosics or agricultural wastes has become important topic for     researchers in LSU-LA, KS, and TN (15, 21, 22, 69). Likewise, researchers in     TN in conjunction with Cargill first produced spun-bonded       and melt-blown nonwovens with good strength, cover, and hand properties     from polylactide derived from the by-products of the fermentation of corn.     Further work is needed on exploring other nonfood uses of agricultural     residues.        Justification for Bio-Processing and Related New Technologies for     Textile Applications       Developing environmentally safer methods for processing textiles can be     done with biological systems, rather than conventional chemistries.     Historically, enzymes have been used for the retting of bast fibers and     desizing of grey goods. In the last decade, enzyme systems have been     developed for bioscouring and antipilling cellulosics and for imparting     anti-felting properties to wool (9). New frontiers in biotechnology for     textile processing include cross-linking of polymer chains to impart     easy-care properties, and enzyme surface modification to enhance     absorption/dyeing and aesthetic properties. Another approach to reducing the     use of energy, chemicals, and time in textile processing is dual or     multi-purpose dyes and finishing agents. KS is developing a dual purpose,     dye-insect control agent produced by linking together a reactive dye with     insect growth regulators. This technology would help reduce the $1 billion     annual loss due to insect attack.       Rapidly progressing, new technologies require innovative materials for a     large variety of applications. Optimizing both the bulk and surface     properties of various materials represents one of the promising approaches     for meeting the technical and economical requirements for high-tech     materials. Because of the cost related to developing new fibers, polymer     chemists now focus on modifying existing fibers to impart the desired     aesthetic or functional properties. Conventional fiber modification methods     include various thermal, mechanical, and chemical treatments. Another     important means of modifying the fiber to increase the uptake of dyes and     finishes or to impart unique functionality is through  plasma technology      (102-104). The reactive species of plasma, resulting from ionization,     fragmentation, and excitation processes, are high enough to dissociate a     wide variety of chemical bonds, resulting in a significant number of     simultaneous recombination mechanisms. Plasma syntheses opens up new     possibilities for polymer chemistry, particularly in industrial applications     where the specific advantages of producing pore-free, uniform thin films of     superior physical, chemical, electrical and mechanical properties have been     required.        The main advantages of plasma polymerization methods are: 1)     applicability to almost all organic, organo-metallic and hetero-atomic     organic compounds, 2) modification of surface properties without altering     the bulk characteristics, 3) low quantities needed of monomeric compounds     making it non energy intensive, and 4) wide applicability to most organic     and inorganic structures. Exciting applications in polymer chemistry include     1) cold plasma discharge synthesis of new polymeric structures, 2) plasma     induced polymerization processes, 3) surface grafting of polymers, and 4)     surface modification of polymers. Characteristics that can be improved     include wettability, flame resistance, adhesive bonding, printability,     electromagnetic radiation reflection, surface hardness etc.        Justification for the Development of Textiles for Protective/Medical     Applications       Specialty textiles contribute to human health, safety, and comfort by     protecting people from exposure to heat, chemicals, pesticides, pathogens in     blood and body fluids, and electromagnetic radiation. AES researchers     continue to focus on developing textile systems for human health and safety.     Two important requirements for protective medical apparel are barrier     effectiveness and comfort for the wearer. Depending on the end-use,     different characteristics are required to achieve the optimum barrier     efficiency. The effectiveness of protective apparel worn by patients and     health care workers continues to be a major concern because of the risks of     infection when the protective apparel fails. The risks are especially great     with the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases. OSHA estimates that     more than 5.6 million health care/public safety workers are at potential     risk of being exposed to HIV and hepatitis B. Centers for Disease Control     [CDC], the Association of Operating Room Nurses [AORN], and the Occupational     Safety and Health Administration [OSHA]) have published guidelines for     health care workers to minimize exposure risks. OSHA mandates that health     care workers wear personal protective equipment that meets specified     performance levels (25).       Another major health concern is the increasing incidence of skin cancer     caused by exposure to sunlight. Skin cancer is the most common form of     cancer in the U.S., resulting in -9,000 deaths annually. Both acute and     cumulative exposure to solar radiation, especially UV-B radiation (280-315     nm), can result in sunburn, aging, immune-suppression, and skin cancer. The     risk of developing skin cancer can be greatly reduced by minimizing exposure     or by using protective apparel. The challenge for textile scientists is to     develop summertime fabrics that are both comfortable and provide adequate     protection. Work is needed to elucidate the relationship between the     chemical structure of dyes and their UV-absorbing properties, and how the     UV-absorption of fabrics is influenced by end-use conditions (light,     laundering, and wear). Researchers in KS, NE, TN, and TX (24, 109, and 123)     are interested in the influence of polymer additives (delustrants, UV     absorbers, and fluorescent whitening agents) on the UVR transmission of     fabrics. Work is needed to answer the question of whether the type of water     (distilled, sea, or pool water) influences UV transmission. A predictive     model is needed that interrelates the influence of fiber, yarn, and fabric     characteristics on UPF of fabrics. Doctors (KU Medical Center) have     requested information on the relationship between fabric and apparel     characteristics that will provide adequate UV protection. Such information      would be beneficial to doctors when counseling patients on preventive     measures for reducing the risk of skin cancer.       Justification for Developing and Evaluating Textiles with Enhanced     Resistance       (or Susceptibility) to Environmental Degradation       Heat, light, atmospheric contaminants, weathering, microorganisms, and     insects are some of the major environmental agents that can attack and     degrade textiles during wear, use, or storage. For many end-use     applications, resistance to these environmental agents is desirable.     However, one or more of these degrading influences may be targeted when     designing textiles that are environmentally degradable. S-272 researchers     have examined many aspects of environmental degradation related to enhancing     the resistance or susceptibility, depending on the product end-use and     requirements.       RELATED CURRENT AND PREVIOUS WORK         Our former Regional Project S-272,  Development of Textile Materials     for Environmental Compatibility and Human Health and Safety  (terminates     9/30/2001) resulted in numerous publications cited herein and at our web     site (http://msa.ars.usda.gov/la/srrc/csrees/main.htm). The proposed     research focuses on developing value-added products from agricultural     fibers, residues, and by-products, especially those having multi-state     importance to the participating states. Greater emphasis will be placed on     developing a) textile products from renewable and recyclable resources and     b) textile processing methods utilizing enzymatic and plasma treatments.     Work will continue on assessing the environmental compatibility of selected     and newly developed materials and their suitability for specific end-uses,     including consumer products and medical/protective textiles. Equipment,     experimental methods, processing technologies, and expertise relative to the     synthesis, extraction, and processing of agri-fibers, previously developed     through S-272 project, will be utilized and expanded upon in this proposed      multi-state-project as reflected in the current and previous work..        Development of Value Added Products from Renewable/Recyclable     Resources       The diversity of resources for this objective result in a concentration     of cooperative efforts under sub-objectives, embracing novel ideas for     making products from renewable and recyclable materials.       New Lyocell and Composite Fibers and Fabrics Derived from Biomass. The     earliest commercial method for manufacturing regenerated cellulosic fibers     (rayon) from delignified wood chips is the viscose process, which is complex     and environmentally-polluting. Today, solvent-spun cellulosic fibers     (lyocell) are being produced from more environmentally benign solvents. A     major limitation of these new lyocell fibers is fibrillation under wet     abrasion conditions. The formation of lyocell fibers from N-methyl     morpholine N-oxide monohydrate, NMMO.H2O, solutions in conditions allowing a     tailored fibrillation is currently being investigated at KS, LA-LSU and TN     (22). This is achieved by controlling rheological parameters in the liquid     crystalline phase preceding fiber formation (77, 78) or by using an     electrical discharge (cold plasma) radio frequency technique, developed by     WI and LSU-LA. Work also has been done on spinning lyocell fibers from     kenaf, steam exploded bagasse, and wheat straw (81, 92). Negulescu et al.     (70) have proposed a scheme to separate the cellulosic component from PC     blends from which lyocell fibers can be spun.        A new area of interest is biosynthetic polymers, such as polylactide     polymers (PLA), produced by Dow-Cargill from corn-derived lactic acid. These     polymers can be processed by melt fabrication methods (61). Morphological     transformation of PLA fibers/fabrics during the application of disperse dyes     have been recently presented by LSU-LA investigators (60).        Non-food Applications of Agricultural By-products and Residues for     Textiles and Composites. Agriculture production generates residues in the     form of cereal straw, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, etc., while the     production and consumption of soft goods generate billions of pounds of     fiber and textile residues. Attention has been drawn to converting these     agri-residues and consumer wastes to textiles, composites, paper pulp, and     other consumer and industrial products. KS researchers have investigated the     use of tocopherols to reduce photo-degradation in fibers and soy proteins as     fillers in thin plastics films (39). More recently, Gatewood, Ramaswamy, et     al. (35) have focused on adding value to agri-composites through bleaching,     dyeing, and controlling particle size. An H2O2 bleaching system with an     acetic acid rinse substantially improved the whiteness of the straw. Major     limitations of straw board that need to be addressed are poor moisture     resistance and adhesion with formaldehyde-based resins because of the waxy     cuticle. Ramaswamy et al. (30) investigated the use of straw and kenaf as     fillers in plastics or high resin composites. The agri-fibers and resins     were ground into specified particle sizes, extruded, chopped into pellets,     and hot pressed into thick plastic sheets, then exposed to heat, light and     weathering. Work is needed on the processing and properties of other     agri-fibers, by-products, and residues, or recyclable materials for     composite applications.       Development of Degradable Cotton-core Nonwovens .  Cotton,     a renewable resource, has many properties that are most suitable for     constructing absorbent nonwoven products. Preparation of nonwovens made of     biomass PLA or polyesterimide at TN could make the cotton-core products     completely biodegradable and further increase consumer appeal (47, 67).     Cotton-core nonwovens will be elaborated in the following sections related     to the use of biodegradable hygiene products.       Development of Kenaf Value-added Products for Textiles and Crafts.        The Kenaf Demonstration Project was started in 1986 with cooperation     from USDA and Kenaf International. Its primary goal was to make the kenaf     industry a reality in the U.S. (New Multi-state Project Development     Committee DC-95-06). Today, kenaf is a market-ready commodity used in making     paper, cordage, fabric blends, etc. (80, 82, 83). Much work has been done on     fiber preparation to facilitate the utilization of kenaf in value-added     products. Research is needed to introduce kenaf to the craft industry for     producing various types of value-added products - baskets, hats, etc. Hence,     kenaf could have a formidable influence on craft industry in AR and other     states.        Development of Industrial Textile Products from Sugarcane Fibers.        Researchers at LSU-LA, FL, and TN (13, 14, 18-20) have focused on     developing products from sugarcane for commercial use in geotextiles and     other industrial applications. This integrated project, involving states     producing almost 85% of the U.S. sugarcane, exemplifies the development of     mill-to-market, bio-based, value-added products. Work has been done at     LSU-LA on delignification, cellulose extraction, and fiber processing     methods. Results indicated that atmospheric extraction can be used and steam     explosion omitted with higher alkaline concentrations (91). A pilot scale     reactor was constructed at LSU-LA to bring the process closer to commercial     production conditions. Preliminary results have demonstrated that sugarcane     rind, mechanically separated from the stalks, can be chemically and     mechanically treated to extract the valuable cellulosic fibers.        Bagasse erosion control mats have been produced and tested against     existing commercial products. These mats were comparable in performance to     commercial wood, straw, and coconut products and had better water, light,     and flame resistance than other commercial products (111, 112). The bagasse     and coconut fiber mats also biodegraded at approximately the same rate.     Significant advantages of the bagasse mats were 1) stitching was not needed     because of fiber entanglement and 2) ability to conform to the contours of     the soil, preventing washout. Preliminary work on bleaching and dyeing of     sugarcane fiber have been carried out (90). The geotextile erosion control     market is an area of expected growth. The development of other value-added     products from bagasse will result in economic development at the local,     national, and international levels.       Development of Bio-Processing and Related New Technologies for     Textile Applications       The overall objective in this multi state research project is to utilize     relatively new surface enhancing technologies to improve the processibility,     functionality, and aesthetics of fabrics. Research activities in this     objective address three important areas related to purifying and enhancing     the characteristics and appearance of textiles: 1) bioprocessing, 2) plasma     application, and 3) digital printing.       Recent advances in biotechnology have given the textile industry new     auxiliaries (enzymes) for wet processing (9). Sarkar and Etters (94-97) have     extensively studied the biopreparation of cotton and enzyme kinetics using     alkaline pectinases. Other enzymes used in biopreparation of cotton are     amylases for desizing and cellulases to enhance the surface characteristics     (smoothness). Ramaswamy et al. are studying the use of enzymes for     biofinishing kenaf and kenaf/cotton blends. Proprietary treatments have     resulted in dramatic increases in the whiteness, appearance, and hand.     Similarly, protein disulfide isomerases are commercially available for     improving the shrinkage behavior of wool (103). Work by Buschle-Diller (8)     at AL investigated the effectiveness of five proteases from plant and     microbial sources on wool fabrics. KS is focusing on developing enzymatic     methods for purifying/biofinishing of wool and specialty hair fibers using     xylanases and pectinases. Gatewood and Ramaswamy (36) have shown that the     wool subjected to chlorination and isomerases was less prone to insect     attack. The surface properties of enzyme-treated fabrics have been studied     by Ramkumar (85) using a simple sliding friction apparatus to objectively     quantify the enhancement.        Research on modifying the surface characteristics of polymers/fibers     using plasma technology has been the focus of research by Sarmadi et al.     (26, 27, 31-33, 49, 50, 101-104) at WI ‘s Plasma Research Institute.     Plasma modification methods serve as a pivotal contribution to the research     work at the other contributing institutions in this project. These studies     have shown new demands for syntheses of special property plasma polymeric     layers, through the incorporation of additional elements, such as various     metals. Studies carried out at WI have demonstrated that low electron energy     (20-30 eV) MS spectrometry of plasma monomers can offer valuable data in     this field.       Development and Evaluation of Textile Systems for Protective and     Medical Applications       A relatively new area of textile development has been the design,     production, and evaluation of textile systems for protecting individuals     from chemicals, heat, harmful electromagnetic radiation, and high-speed     impact (air bags and bullet-proof vests). Recent studies by AU, NE, and KS     have focused on quantifying the degree of UV protection afforded by textile     materials and in identifying the various factors that affect it. These     states have the expertise and instrumentation for determining UPF values for     textiles. Many parameters influence a fabric’s UV transmission. NE and     KS (24, 109) have generated databases of UPF values for a range of fiber and     fabric types. Recent work by Crews et al. has shown that fabric porosity is     the best predictor of UV blocking properties, and polyester, silk, and wool     fabrics exhibited better UV blocking properties than cotton or rayon. Zhou     and Crews (123) demonstrated that detergents with optical brighteners     improved the UV blocking ability of fabrics. Srinivasan and Gatewood (109)     investigated the influence of 95 dyes on the UV protection provided by     cotton and nylon fabrics and the relationship between chemical constitution     and UV absorption. Most of the dyes caused a substantial reduction in the UV     transmission, and the reduction was linear with concentration up to a point.     The interpretation of the absorption spectra of the dyes with respect to     their chemical structure indicated that in most dyes, UV absorption depended     on specific structural attributes rather than the chemical class to which     they belong. Work is needed on how environmental conditions (water and light     exposure) and other additives influence UV transmission.        Previous studies by WI (88, 89, 98-100), TN, GA (51-58) and KS (64) have     addressed the barrier properties of textile substrates for human health and     safety. Fabric penetration and worker contamination depend on the fiber     chemistry, yarn/fabric construction, surface treatments, and environmental     conditions. Growing concern about HIV and other infectious diseases     attributed to blood borne pathogens has resulted in the development and     testing of the barrier properties of textiles to fluids and microorganisms.     Many medical textiles do not have adequate barrier properties to effectively     protect medical personnel from pathogens. Sarmadi et al. (88, 89) and Leonas     and Huang (52, 55, 58) have shown that fabrics treated with low surface     tension liquids (fluorochemicals) have enhanced barrier properties. They (7,     53, 54-57) also have identified parameters critical to barrier properties,     e.g., fabric surface chemistry, fabric geometry, challenge liquid, and     organism properties. The complex nature of fabrics resulted in many     challenges for investigators. Advances in microscopy technology have     provided insight into transmission mechanisms. Researchers at GA evaluated     the mechanism of small particle transmission necessary to develop new     fabrics with suitable barrier properties using Laser Scanning Confocal     Microscopy. Work continues on developing moisture permeable fabrics that     provide barriers to liquids and microorganisms. Other studies by Cloud et     al. (11, 12) have focused on the comfort of protective apparel by objective     and subjective methods. Correlations were found between objective and     subjective data, comfort and barrier efficiency, and specific fabric     characteristics. As new materials are developed, comfort assessment is     critical.       Development of Textiles with Enhanced Resistance        (or Susceptibility) to Environmental Degradation       The term “sustainability” has been adopted to convey the     realization that our environment is more favorably served by conserving     resources, be it by improving the durability of textiles, making materials     more biodegradable, or recycling of plastics or fabrics. For example,     reclaiming the cellulosic component from a polyester-cotton blend would     provide an excellent source for the production of the more environmentally     friendly fiber, lyocell. Negulescu et al. (69) proposed a process for     separating the cellulosic component from blends from which lyocell fiber can     be spun.        Researchers at KS and WI are focusing on the biological resistance of     wool. A recent study (36) has shown that most wool and specialty hair fibers     are readily attacked by webbing clothes moth and black carpet beetle larvae,     but the extent of degradation is influenced somewhat by animal type, fiber     fineness, and chemical treatments. With the elimination of dieldrin and the     potential ban on other insecticides (59), research is needed on alternative     methods of insect control. Current work at KS and WI is evaluating     multifunctional reactive dyes and plasma treatments for imparting insect     control.       New biosynthetic polymers, such as PLA polymers and some copolyesters     are easily synthesized from renewable resources via fermentation from     carbohydrate-rich material, such as food industry by-products (dairy wastes     and potato peels). PLA polymers are bio-/hydro-degradable and offer a broad     balance of functional performance, making them suitable for many     applications. They are expected to compete with hydrocarbon-based     thermoplastics on a cost/performance basis.        Cotton has many outstanding properties suitable for constructing     effective capillary control in absorbent nonwovens. Internal microscopic     pore spaces of cotton contribute to its ability to swell during the     transition from the dry to the wet state. The excellent absorbency and water     retention properties of cotton-core laminates with melt-blown polypropylene     webs have been demonstrated (65, 117), but these nonwovens are not     biodegradable. Nonwovens made of PLA (47) or polyesterimide (67) at TN could     further expand the use of cotton in the large absorbent cores market and     make the products completely biodegradable to further increase consumer     appeal.       OBJECTIVES         The research outlined in this project proposal focuses on the following     four main objectives:                To develop value added products from renewable and recyclable         resources.           To develop bioprocessing and related new technologies for textile         applications.           To develop and evaluate textile systems for protective and medical         applications.           To develop and evaluate textiles with enhanced resistance (or         susceptibility)              to environmental degradation.       This multifaceted research agenda requires the intense cooperative     efforts among the participating states because each has unique facilities     and faculty expertise. For example, KS, LSU-LA, TX, WI, and TN are on the     forefront of product development. Researchers at AL, AU, FL, AR, GA, and NE     have the expertise in characterizing fabrics and evaluating functional     performance and environmental compatibility.The above objectives can only be     accomplished through cooperative research studies, and 11 states have     pledged their support and participation. The broad spectrum of     scientific/technical expertise offered by the participating states is of the     highest caliber and includes textile chemistry, agricultural value-added     product development research, fabrication including nonwoven and composite     manufacturing, environmental sciences, entomology and environmental     toxicology, and accelerated and in-service studies. Many different crops and     fiber sources, processing facilities, and textile testing equipmentare     needed to accomplish the above objectives. No single university alone has     the resources required to develop end-products and processing methods or     evaluate the characteristics or properties of the textile materials and     composites proposed herein. Also, the funding required to accomplish such     broad and comprehensive research objectives is substantial. Therefore, RRF     funding is required and necessary.       METHODS         Objective #1:   To Develop Value Added Products from Renewable     and Recyclable Resources       New Lyocell and Composite Fibers and Fabrics Derived from Biomass.     Investigations on lyocell fibers, fabrics and composites will continue at     LSU-LA, TN, KS, and WI in the following areas with the technical support     from SRRC: 1) lyocell fibrillation, 2) producing lyocell from agrifibers and     consumer wastes, 2) developing biomass-derived polyhydroxylated nylons, 3)     preparation of lyocell composites with PLA and polyhydroxylated nylons, and     4) alteration of surface properties of lyocell fibers and fabrics prepared     in 2) and 3) by reactive plasma. In some instances, fibrillated-spun lyocell     has advantages in making nonwovens, e.g., aesthetics and hydro-entanglement.     It is envisioned that lyocell (woody), bagasse, or wheat straw fibers spun     from NMMO/water solutions can be easily transformed into nonwovens. For     example, specialty nonwovens can be obtained by cellulose derivatization,     and ion exchange materials for filtration can be prepared by reacting     lyocell bagasse fibers with cationic/anionic compounds suitable for removing     reactive dyes and heavy metals from industrial wastewater.        Polyhydroxylated polyamides (PHPA) obtained from biomass carbohydrates     are promising candidates for making nylons. NMMO monohydrate also may be a     good solvent for PHPA. Unique molecular composites can be formed by     co-solving PLA or PHPA in a lyocell solution. Current research at LSU-LA is     preparing molecular composites based on PHPA/lyocell solutions (68-71). The     rheological behavior of the lyocell solutions prepared by common research     protocols at KS, TN, LSU-LA will be used to predict the processability and     effects of impurities (e.g., lignin). Thermal stability and crystallization     temperatures will be determined by DSC, TGA, dielectric relaxation, and     thermo-gravimetry measurements.        Sarmadi at WI’s Plasma Research Center will coordinate the     methodology and treatments for surface modifications of fibers and materials     to enhance functional properties. The plasma-created surface layers of     synthetic and natural fabrics, films and composites will be investigated at     other participating institutions by ATR-IR, ESCA, AFM, surface wettability,     and dyeability. Data collection and analysis will be coordinated by WI. This     will represent one of the most comprehensive integrated studies on plasma     treatment of natural and synthetic materials.       Non-food Applications of Agricultural By-products and Residues for     Textiles and Composites.       Researchers at AL, KS, and LSU-LA will focus on developing agri-boards     and composites from agri-residues, alternative bast fibers (kenaf and     bagasse), and recycled fibers. Comparative research will be done on the     surface chemistry and morphology of fibers for composite application and its     influence on bonding. The goal is to develop agri-boards with better     internal bonding and moisture resistance, which are major market     limitations. KS and LSU-LA will develop disposable and durable plastic     products with renewable carbohydrate-based fillers and gypsum. For each     filling system, formulas with promising properties will be prepared for     tensile testing using injection-molding (2) at optimum molding temperatures,     pressures, and cooling conditions, then further evaluated for stability. KS     and LSU-LA will develop standard board/composite preparation methods and     testing protocols, which will facilitate collective data analysis.       Mechanical and chemical surface treatments will be done to enhance     bonding. The lignocellulosic will be subjected to five defibrillation     techniques [acids, alkalis, thermo-chemical, organic solvents, and enzymes].     All plasma treatments will be done at WI; and KS and WI will investigate the     surface changes. Alternative resins systems to be explored are phenolics and     epoxies in conjunction with coupling agents. The experimental, hot pressed     composites will be tested using the facilities in KS. Surface     functionalities and bonding at the lignocellulosic-resin interface will be     evaluated by XPS, AT-IR, and SEM. Thermal phase transitions, mechanical     properties, morphology, and water absorption will be evaluated for specified     temperatures, humidity, light, and storage time exposures. The resistance of     the agri-boards to water, weathering, insects, and microorganisms will be     done at KS, GA, and LSU-LA using standard AATCC and ASTM test methods to     facilitate cooperative data analysis (1, 2).       Recently, WI has started work on plasma treatment of starch to produce     new plastics. The advantage of plasma treatment over conventional methods to     incorporate starch and other renewable resources is that since the plasma     modifies only the surface of starch molecules, the bulk properties are     unchanged, insuring biodegradation of the new product. Likewise, treated     surface of starch produce a much stronger bond with other monomers,     preventing phase separation. LSU-LA, in conjunction with WI and TN, is     studying the thermal behavior of the new plastics with promising results     (62).       Development of Degradable Cotton-core Nonwovens. Cotton Inc. has     sponsored research at TN on developing cotton-core nonwovens (CCN) for     diapers and hygiene products. CCN’s have been made by sandwiching     cotton cores containing from 50:50 cotton/PP to 100% cotton between two     thermally bonded melt blown (MB) PP webs, two spun bonded (SB) PP webs, or     between a MB and SB web. These CCN’s have excellent wicking and     absorbency properties, but are not totally biodegradable. Hence, MB webs     will be produced from PLA, PEA and copolyester resins, then thermally bonded     to cotton webs. Optimal bonding conditions will be determined for CCN’s     containing cotton cores ranging from 15-100 g/m2 and with outer layers of     PLA, PEA, copolyester, and PP webs weighing 10-30 g/m2. Biodegradability     will be determined at WI. Hand properties of the nonwovens will be evaluated     at TX using methods developed by Ramkumar (86-87). As in the previous     regional project, the melt-blown facilities at TN are unique and necessary     for preparing all of the nonwoven samples used by other participating     states.        Development of Kenaf Value-Added Products for Textiles and Crafts.       Researchers at LSU-LA and SU-LA will continue collaborative research on     improving kenaf yarns for apparel applications. Kenaf fiber will be     extracted from raw kenaf currently growing at SU using bacterial and     chemical retting methods, then spun into kenaf/cotton yarns on ring or rotor     spinning frames. The blended yarns and fabrics will be mercerized at LSU     using NaOH or ammonia and characterized using ASTM standards and the KES-FB     instruments (2, 106). AR will focus on developing value-added craft products     from kenaf cultivar, Everglades 41. After processing, the fibers will be     hand-carded and spun to develop methods suitable for AR’s craft     industry.       Development of Industrial Textile Products from Sugarcane Fibers. FL,     TN, and LSU-LA will further develop value-added products from bagasse     fibers. Specific research objectives are: 1) to compare fibers extracted     from different sugarcane varieties in FL and LA, 2) to develop     needle-punched nonwoven mats and spun yarns, and 3) to investigate the     effects of different treatments on the dyeability. The sifted bagasse will     be treated with NaOH and carded with other cellulosic fibers to form mats.     Fiber blending properties will be measures on the Kawabata Pure Bending     Tester using a method developed by Collier et al. (23). Other parameters to     be measured are the effectiveness of the carrier fibers in processing and     increasing mat strength, length variability between the blended fibers,     optimum fiber weights, and the effects of fiber processing lubricants. The     carded fiber webs will be further processed into slivers and spun into yarns     after determining optimum spinning conditions. Yarn properties will be     measured and correlated with fiber length, tex, and bending properties. Yarn     characteristics also will be related to web formation method and carding     machine type. FL will study the dyeing behavior using reactive and direct     dyes, followed by colorfastness testing (2). Because of their expertise,     researchers at LSU-LA and TN will coordinate data collection/analysis on     sugarcane product development and provide input on other projects on value      added product development.       LSU-LA, TN, and KS will continue to study the use of agricultural fibers     (sugarcane, kenaf, cotton, flax, ramie, etc.) and recycled polymer materials     for making nonwovens. Specific objectives include 1) the development of     methods for separating the polymer/fiber from industrial remnants, 2)     processing the fibers into nonwovens, and 3) determining effective     approaches to improving end-use performance of nonwovens. New approaches to     recycling natural and synthetic polymers will be investigated. Recycled     fibers will be blended and carded to form fiber webs, then needle-punched to     form nonwovens. SRRC (38) will assist in developing finishing methods to     improve end-use performance. The prototype nonwovens developed will be     prepared using TN’s unique facilities.        Objective #2: To Develop Bioprocessing and Related New Technologies     for Textiles       Research related to bioprocessing and other new technologies for textile     applications will be restricted to the application of enzymes to cellulosic     and protein fibers, plasma surface treatments to modifying the functional     properties of fibers, and newly emerging technologies related to coloration.     Participating states will cooperate in the selection, application, and     evaluation of the enzyme treatments to facilitate collective data analysis.     However, individual states will focus on specific fiber types. AL will focus     on developing one-bath processes for desizing/scouring/bleaching cotton     using enzymes (8). Potential advantages include less water usage, energy     consumption, and fiber damage, making this process attractive.     Amyloglucosidases will be used for desizing because they produce the most     glucose from starch; and pectinases from different organisms will be     investigated for bioscouring. Glucose produced during scouring/desizing can     be converted into H2O2 for bleaching by glucose oxidase enzymes, making it     possible to reuse treatment baths. Enzymes selection will be based on     compatibility in their active pH/temperature ranges. TX also will continue     to investigate the use of neutral enzymes found in the environment to     achieve a softer hand on resin-treated cotton fabrics. The goal is to     achieve fabrics that have a wrinkle-free effect with improved softness and     hand. Enzyme kinetic studies will be done at CO. The treated cotton fabrics     will be characterized for whiteness, mechanical properties, and surface     changes. Important parameters in evaluating the effectiveness of     bioprocessing methods are changes in hand and appearance. Most of the hand     evaluation studies on enzyme-treated fabrics will be performed at TX using a     sliding friction method developed by Ramkumar (85-87). This method is able     to discriminate among fabrics treated with different levels of cellulase     enzymes, which typically exhibit lower friction values and improved hand.            KS will continue developing bioprocessing methods for scouring wool and     specialty hair fibers (camel, llama, alpaca, cashmere, mohair, and rabbit).     Proteases, typically used for bioscouring, can cause fiber degradation.     Removal of waxes/skin particles may be more effectively done by pectinases     and xylanases without degrading proteins. Research will focus on developing     enzymes systems and optimum conditions of pH, time, and temperature. Fiber     characteristics to be evaluated include strength, length/width, and     topography and chemical changes using SEM and FT-IR spectroscopy.        AL, WI, and KS scientists will evaluate the surface characteristics and     chemistry of the processed wool and specialty hair fibers. Additionally, the     dye affinity studies will provide answers to the consumer related     properties. Dyes selected will depend on the chemical classes of the dye and     the chemistry of fibers. Wool fibers also will be used in     spinning/weaving/knitting trials to evaluate the quality of fibers and     fabrics produced. The spinning/weaving/knitting trials will be done at the     SRRC/USDA or TX.        Researchers at WI and TX will investigate the influence of the following     plasma treatments on the structures, surface properties and deposition rates     in plasma-generated layers: 1) RF power dissipated the electrodes or     inductive coil, 2) pressure in the system in the absence of plasma, 3)     pressure in the reactor during the plasma process, 4) reaction period, 5)     pressure variations during the deposition reactions, 6) temperature of the     substrate, and nature of RF coupling. Plasma treated fabrics from WI will be     supplied to TX for the evaluation of surface and hand-related properties.            One of the most recent developments in textile coloration is digital     printing because of its many advantages, e.g., speed, fine line detail,     energy savings, and rapid design change (29). Most digital printing systems     for textiles are currently being used to print samples rather than products.     Work is needed on developing digital printing systems that meet consumer and     industry standards for depth of shade and fastness properties (1, 2). SU-LA     will investigate digital printing methods for different fiber types     (cellulosic, protein, and synthetic fibers) using different ink types     (reactive dyes for cellulosics, disperse dyes for synthetics, and acid dyes     for protein fibers) and fixation methods. Plasma-treated fabrics from WI     also will be printed to examine the effects of various surface modification     on affinity, depth of shade, and fastness to light, weathering, crocking,     and laundering (1). Hand measurements for all treated fabrics will be done     using Kawabata instruments at LSU-LA.and the surface friction method at TX.            Objective #3: To Develop and Evaluate Protective and Medical Textile     Systems               Research will focus on developing textiles that provide protection     against UV radiation and blood borne pathogens, and the comfort assessment     of these products. AU, KS and NE will continue to evaluate the influence of     dyes, UV absorbers, and finishes on the UV transmission properties. KS and     NE have identical Perkin Elmer UV/visible spectrophotometers for evaluating     UPF, making them unique in their ability to coordinate test protocol and     data analysis. Gatewood and Crews also participated in the initial meetings     of RA106 that developed AATCC Test Method183 (1) for evaluating UPF.     Previous work was limited to direct and reactive dyes on cotton and acid and     disperse dyes on nylon fabric. KS has shown that some vat dyes are strong UV     absorbers (109). Hence, future work will focus on vat dyes on cotton,     disperse and basic dyes on acrylic fabrics, and pigment colorants for PP     because of their widespread use for outdoor fabrics. The dope-colored     polypropylene nonwovens will be spun bonded at TN. Secondly, selected     colorants with high UV absorption will be applied in conjunction with UV     absorbers to determine synergistic effects. Previous research at KS and NE     focused on woven fabrics. Future work will characterize knitted fabrics in     terms of porosity, yarn construction, gauge, and finishes to determine the     construction parameters effecting UV transmission values. Lastly, a     predictive model will be developed based on cumulative data to provide a     mathematical model for manufacturers to use in selecting fabrics and     creating apparel with optimum sun protection. Researchers at FL will assess     the comfort properties of the fabrics that provide improved sun protection,     based on subjective and objective components.       GA will continue to examine the mechanisms of particle and liquid     transmission through textile based surgical protective clothing and     equipment, and parameters that influence transmission, e.g., fiber size,     fabric geometry, surface characteristics and finishes, such as antimicrobial     treatments. This information will aid in the development of fabrics that     meet the OSHA standards and have the desired characteristics for the     specified end-use. Pore size/distribution will be measured using an     Automated Perm Porometer (1); pore geometry will be assessed by SEM and     confocal microscopy. The liquid barrier properties will be measured by ASTM     F 1670 and F-1862 (2); and the antibacterial properties will be measured     according to AATCC Test Methods 100 and 147 (1) using microorganisms causing     hospital-acquired infections. The thermal comfort properties of the fabrics     developed for medical uses also will be evaluated by FL researchers to     better understand the relationship between barrier properties and perceptual     and physiological responses of the body. Comfort properties will be assessed     based on the body temperatures of human subjects in an environmental test     chamber.       Research in AL will focus on developing intelligent, stimuli- sensitive     fibers and fabrics (SSP) that change their character or regulate performance     properties in a desirable manner when the surrounding environment changes     (115). Fibers developed from these polymers or made from existing fibers     coated with SSP’s will be investigated in terms of possible     applications. Natural chitosan polymers have promising potential for SSP’s.     Grafting or UV-curing technologies will be applied to these polymers to     introduce constituents. The goal is to reduce response times for phase     transitions under controlled conditions. Practical uses include time release     of drugs, temperature regulation in exercise clothing, robotic muscles, and     temperature sensors. Researchers participating in the subtopics outlined     above will cooperate in fabric selection, research protocol, and collective     data analysis.        Objective #4: To Develop and Evaluate Textiles with Enhanced     Resistance       (or Susceptibility) to Environmental Degradation       Researchers working on Objective 4 are driven by the common goal of “sustainability,”     recognizing that the environment is better served by conserving resources     through improving the durability, making it more biodegradable, or by     recycling. AR researchers will develop unique nonwoven needle- punched     composites containing recycled PET and PP blended with kenaf and cotton to     enhance biodegradability. These needle-punched nonwovens will be prepared at     SRCC, LSU-LA, and TN and subjected to soil burial tests for 2-16 weeks, then     evaluated for changes in physical properties (thickness, weight, strength,     and color change). Microscopic examination will be used to determine types     of and amounts of fungal growth.        Totally biodegradable cotton-based nonwovens will be prepared at TN     using MB webs of PLA, PEA, and Eastar Bio-copolyester. Processing conditions     will be optimized to produce the finest fibers with each resin. Similar     weight webs of 100% PP also will be made for comparison. Physical tests will     include weight, thickness, bursting strength, air permeability, and flexural     rigidity using ASTM and AATCC test methods (1, 2). GA will determine the     porosity and contact angles of the MB webs and composites with a PMI     instrument and Chan Dynamic Contact Angle tester, respectively. Degradation     of the nonwoven webs will be determined at WI and AR using ATCC Test Method     30 (1). Other important end-use tests to be done at TN are the Harnett and     Mehta's Transverse Wicking Plate Test (40) and the absorbency and water     retention capacity tests (109).        KS will focus on determining how dye fading during light exposure     reduces the UPF of fabrics. It is well known that UV and visible radiation     can cause a chemical change and loss in color because of the changes in     visible absorption, but little is known about how light exposure change the     absorption of UV-A and UV-B radiation. Cotton and nylon fabrics dyed with     selected direct, reactive, and vat dyes or disperse and acid dyes, will be     exposed to xenon radiation following the procedures in AATCC Test Method 16     (1), simulating outdoor exposure, then evaluated for changes in the UPF     values.       Since DDT and dieldrin have been banned by EPA, only a limited number of     insect resist agents are available commercially. Because of the potential     hazards of insect-resist agents, two alternative methods will be explored in     KS. The first approach is to develop dual purpose reactive dye that have     both coloration and insect resist capabilities. The reactive dyes used for     synthesis will contain two reactive groups. One group (e.g., a     monochlorotriazine) with an R = -NH2 group will be reacted with a -COOH     group on a potential pesticide moiety to form a -CO-NH- (amide) linkage,     which is found in protein fiber. It is anticipated that the amide group can     be hydrolyzed in the insect gut to release the insecticide moiety. The most     likely compounds are chlorinated aromatics, some of which resemble dye     chromaphores. Jones et al. (45) developed fiber-reactive derivatives of     organophosphorus compounds, which was deemed a new approach, but a     literature review reveals no attempt to make a dual purpose reactive dye.     The dual-purpose dyes will be applied to wool fabrics using conventional     dyeing procedures for reactive dyes (59). Cold plasma treatment will be done     at WI to impart functional groups, such as –CN, and SiClx in addition     to grafting other chlorinated aromatic groups on the surface of wool and     specialty hair fibers to increase insect-repellence. Different power,     pressure, flow rate and treatment time will be used to achieve a condition,     which provides the maximum insect-repellence. Using plasma to impart insect     repellence is a novel approach that reduces air, water and land pollution in     comparison to conventional methods of wet chemistry. This novel treatment     promises to extend the useful life of consumer textiles and apparel by     enhancing insect resistance. The insect resistance of the experimental     compounds will be evaluated against webbing clothes moths and black carpet     beetles according to AATCC Test Method 24 (1). All insect testing will be     done at KS because it has one of the few labs currently able to do insect     testing.        As shown in Table 2, most of the states will be participating in more     than one research objective, and each research objective has multiple state     participants. This is crucial for this unique interdependent project     requiring specific facilities housed at only one or perhaps two     participating institutions, e.g., nonwoven facilities (TN), plasma center     (WI), UPF equipment (KS and NE), confocal microscopy (GA), friction testing     (TX), fiber extrusion equipment (LSU-LA and KS), printing equipment (SU-LA     and KS), and outdoor testing facilities (AK, GA, and FSU).        MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS AND RESULTS         Unique  outcomes  of this project will be in the areas of:       a.Bioprocessing methods developed in this project using enzymes and     plasma treatment will be used to enhance the quality of textile products and     have a significant impact on industrial fabric preparation, dyeing and     finishing methods.       b.Obtaining and characterizing the fiber-forming cellulose or     agricultural residues will open doors for fiber producing industries. For     example, this work may lead to newer lyocell fiber, which will be better     than TencelR or a plant source for polyester.       c.With an increasing demand for composites and a reduction in     petrochemical based polymers, the agriplastics/bioplastics will make a     significant impact on the plastics industry and will save the environment by     reducing the disposal of non-biodegradable products.       d.Plasma treatments will be used to modify the surface of fibers and     other products, thus facilitate processing making them more useful. For     example, if wheat straw pulp could be made into a spunlaced nonwoven fabric,     then it can be plasma-treated to create a surface that would make the fabric     an efficient filter for various dye molecules would significantly reduce the     extent of environmental pollution.       e.Using the database of UV transmission values generated for a variety     of fibers and fabrics, a predictive mathematical model will be developed for     use by the textile and apparel industry. Publications will be prepared for     the medical community to use in advising skin cancer patients, as well as     technical publications to share with the scientific community.       f.Nonwovens with cotton core will provide not only comfortable     nonwovens, but also with PLA on either side will make it biodegradable.       g.By identifying and understanding the relationships between specific     fabric characteristics and barrier effectiveness, products can be designed     and selected for optimum protection. This will provide invaluable info to     manufacturers of medical protective equipment and users.       h.Publications – cooperative presentations.       i.ITAA special sessions       j.From Oct. 2001 – Sept. 2002, cotton-core degradable nonwovens     will be produced. Physical testing and wicking absorbency evaluations of     cotton-core nonwovens will be performed at TN, and GA will perform porosity     tests. Soil burial tests will be performed at WI. All the participating     universities will share results and present their findings at the     Multi-state Project Technical Meeting in the fall of 2003. The first papers     should be presented at technical conferences such as AATCC, INDA/TAPPI INTC,      and TANDEC meetings during 2003-4.       aa. Refinements will be made in the fabrics as appropriate during     2003-2004, and a second round of performance testing will be conducted     during 2003-2005. Additional papers will be presented and published in     refereed journals during 2004-2006 and success stories will be featured in     newsletters such as TANDEC and University Newsletters (milestone).

Longer runs mean cheaper electricity, and the  savings should help nuclear power plants compete with coal- and gas-powered  plants, especially as the nation and the world look for sources of energy  that won't contribute to global warming.    Researchers from the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have teamed up to formulate the new fuel. The researchers still have to  spell out the details of their concoction, but their basic recipe is simple:  mix a healthy dose of thorium into the uranium that now powers commercial  reactors.                    Nuclear engineers Philip MacDonald (seated) and Steve Herring lead INEEL's   efforts on the new fuel.                     Standard reactor fuel consists almost entirely of uranium dioxide. The  team of eight researchers from INEEL and MIT propose replacing more than  half of the uranium dioxide with thorium dioxide. As the fuel undergoes  a nuclear chain reaction some of the thorium will turn into a type of  uranium that can join in the reaction and lengthen the life of the fuel.    In addition to saving money, the new fuel also promises to improve reactor  safety and ease the problems of disposing of spent fuel. The mixed fuel  should conduct heat better and run at lower temperatures than all-uranium  fuel, making it slightly easier to cool a reactor core quickly, should  it prove necessary. Because it will last longer, the new fuel will generate  less waste. It should also produce waste that is more stable than waste  from all-uranium fuel.    Work on the new fuel started a year ago as part of a partnership between  the laboratory and the university called the Strategic Nuclear Research  Collaboration. The fuel project plays to the strengths of the two institutions,  says nuclear engineer Mujid Kazimi, who leads the university's efforts  in the collaboration and on the project. ""Both INEEL and MIT have good  histories as far as developing the tools to study new fuels,"" he says.                       The SNRC and NERI          The thorium-uranium fuel project is one of several teaming nuclear   scientists and engineers from the Idaho National Engineering and   Environmental Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.     The fuel project originated as part of the Strategic Nuclear Research   Collaboration, a partnership between the two institutions formed   in 1998. The laboratory supplies research money for the SNRC, which   itself is part of the University Research Consortium, a laboratory   program to promote cooperation with university researchers.     ""When we first formulated this collaboration, we wanted to go   where the top-flight talent would be,"" says INEEL's Tim Leahy, who   manages the SNRC. ""Everyone would agree that MIT has top-flight   people in nuclear science and engineering.""                           MIT nuclear engineer Mujid Kazimi.                         Nuclear engineer Mujid Kazimi, who leads MIT's efforts on the   fuel project and in the SNRC, says the capabilities of the laboratory   and the university complement each other. ""This collaboration brings   MIT's scientific strength together with INEEL's engineering strength,""   he says.     Researchers from the two institutions first identified the issues   needing to be addressed before nuclear technology can move forward--the   economics of nuclear power, reactor safety, spent-fuel disposal,   and the control of the proliferation of nuclear-weapons technology.     They then chose four research projects that address these concerns.   The researchers are designing two new types of reactors, devising   an improved regulation scheme for DOE facilities, and formulating   the new fuel. The new fuel neatly addresses all four of the major   issues.     Although it is only a year old, the mixed-fuel project has already   outgrown its roots. In May, the Department of Energy awarded the   project one of its Nuclear Energy Research Initiative grants. Through   the grants, the DOE aims to maintain the United States' preeminence   in nuclear science and technology.     Philip MacDonald, INEEL lead nuclear engineer on the project,   says NERI funding should see the researchers through the vital first   stage of the work. ""The three-year NERI project is intended to convince   ourselves and the fuel vendors that this is a viable technology.""                The researchers are currently studying the fuel in the virtual reactors  within their computers, and tests in real reactors are a few years away.  However, the project has already shown enough promise to win additional  support from the Department of Energy.    ""Considering the potential for this fuel and given that we have a top-flight  team assembled to work on it, I'm really excited about this program,""  says INEEL's Tim Leahy, manager of the SNRC. ""I think it's one of the  best things we've got going.""       Taking the gas out of the greenhouse        Interest in nuclear power is rising, especially as the world looks for  alternatives to fossil fuels, which produce much of the air pollution  threatening the Earth's climate. At the rates populations and economies  are growing, the amount of coal, natural gas, and oil burned annually  around the globe will increase at least 60 percent in 30 years. By the  year 2030 humanity will be pumping that much more carbon dioxide--the  gas most likely to cause global warming--into the atmosphere.    The world clearly could use a source of energy that generates less carbon  dioxide. But most of the alternatives--wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric,  fuel-crop power--either produce too little energy, cost too much, or are  not sufficiently developed to compete with natural gas, coal, and oil  in the short term. ""For today and the foreseeable future, nuclear energy  remains the only viable alternative to hydrocarbons,"" says nuclear engineer  Philip MacDonald, who leads INEEL's efforts to develop the new fuel. ""If  we want to control greenhouse gases, we have to use nuclear power.""    Nuclear power supplies 20 percent of the electricity used in the United  States. Yet the U.S. nuclear industry struggles because nuclear power  plants are expensive to build. Nuclear power plants and coal-burning plants  can both generate electricity for roughly two cents per kilowatt-hour.  However, a nuclear power plant costs more to build than a coal-burning  plant, and this difference drives up rates for nuclear power.    The team from INEEL and MIT hope to help nuclear power along by developing  a fuel that can be used up to twice as long as regular fuel. The vast  majority of the 104 nuclear power plants in the U.S. shut down at least  once every 18 months to refuel. The INEEL and MIT researchers hope the  new fuel will enable plants to run between 24 and 36 months before refueling.  Doubling the length of the current fuel cycle would allow today's nuclear  power plants to produce five percent more electricity for the same cost.  The increase in efficiency would save the industry roughly a billion dollars  each year.    While the margins may not astound, they may be big enough to make a  nuclear power plant more attractive than a coal-powered plant, especially  when factoring in the amount of carbon dioxide the latter pumps out. ""Each  1,000 megawatt coal plant burns enough coal each day to fill a train a  mile long,"" says Steve Herring, an INEEL nuclear engineer working on the  mixed fuel project. ""A nuclear power plant prevents putting millions of  tons of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants into the  air each year.""         Waste not, want not       To lengthen the fuel cycle, the researcher must sustain the nuclear  chain reaction in the core of a reactor. To do this the researchers need  to control the number of subatomic particles called neutrons whizzing  around inside the core, since it is the neutrons that determine how hot  the reaction will be and how long it will last.    A nuclear power plant is essentially a giant steam engine. The core  generates tremendous heat, and in a typical commercial power plant, pressurized  water circulates through the core to carry this heat away. The hot pressurized  water is used to boil water in a second closed-loop system. Steam in the  secondary system drives turbines that generate electricity.                            In a pressurized water reactor, heat from the core is carried away by circulating pressurized water. The heat boils water in a secondary loop, and the resulting steam drives turbines that generate electricity. (Illustration by Jim Davidson.)                   The core consists of hundreds of vertical tubes--called fuel rods--that  contain the nuclear fuel. Within the core, uranium atoms split, releasing  energy and spitting out neutrons. These neutrons crash into other uranium  atoms and cause them to split, releasing more energy and more neutrons.  A chain reaction known as fission ensues, which produces the heat.    Not every uranium nucleus will break apart when struck with a neutron.  Uranium comes in several different types--known as isotopes--that differ  only in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Uranium-235 is the isotope  that will undergo fission. But 95 percent of the uranium in regular reactor  fuel is uranium-238, which has three more neutrons per nucleus and will  not split. Fission fizzles out when the number of uranium-235 atoms dips  too low.                    When   a neutron crashes into a uranium-235 nucleus, the nucleus becomes   unstable and splits. Neutrons ejected in the collision crash into   other nuclei, causing a chain reaction.  (Illustration by Jim Davidson.)                   Fresh all-uranium fuel produces so many neutrons the chain reaction  tends to go too fast and overheat the core. To prevent this, special neutron-absorbing  materials--called burnable poisons--are built into the fuel. The absorbed  neutrons essentially go to waste. ""If you want to use present-day fuels  for a long time, you have to add substances to absorb some of the neutrons  produced early on,"" Herring says. ""Our thought was to use those neutrons  to produce more fuel that can be used later.""    The INEEL and MIT researchers hope to use some of the neutrons produced  early in the reaction to convert thorium into uranium right in the core  of the reactor. Thorium comes in only one isotope, thorium-232. A thorium  nucleus won't split, but it will gladly absorb a neutron. However, doing  so makes the nucleus unstable, so it quickly decays--by a process called  beta decay--to transform itself into uranium-233. A uranium-233 nucleus  has two fewer neutrons than a uranium-235 nucleus. But like its heavier  sibling, it will undergo fission.                       A thorium   nucleus absorbs a neutron and beta decays twice to produce a uranium-233   nucleus, which can join in a chain reaction. In beta decay, the nucleus   emits an electron (green) while one of the neutrons (red) in the nucleus   turns into a proton (blue).  (Illustration by Jim Davidson.)                   So as the chain reaction begins in a fresh batch of thorium-uranium  fuel, the neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 will slowly turn the  thorium into uranium-233. By the time the uranium-235 is spent, enough  uranium-233 will have accumulated to keep the reaction going.         The challenges ahead            The researchers must overcome a number of technical hurdles before they  can whip up a batch and load it into a power plant. The largest challenge  is to find a better material for the cladding--the tubes that hold the  nuclear fuel. Cladding is typically made from alloys containing zirconium.    Cladding must endure several hardships while in the reactor core. Neutrons  ricochet off the atoms in the cladding and occasionally knock some of  them out of their proper places, causing the metal to become brittle.  The cladding also corrodes, which further weakens it. Finally, when the  uranium atoms split, they produce gases that accumulate in the sealed  fuel rods, increasing the pressure on the cladding.                      For today and the foreseeable future, nuclear energy remains the only viable alternative to hydrocarbons.    —nuclear engineer Philip MacDonald                   Because it will run at lower temperatures, the thorium-uranium fuel  will release less gas and exert less pressure on the tubing. However,  the problems with the neutron bombardment and corrosion remain, and before  the researchers can increase the length of the fuel cycle, they will need  to find a more durable material. ""I think the cladding chemistries are  out there,"" says Steve Schultz, a nuclear engineer at MIT ""But they need  more testing and development.""    The researchers will also have to optimize the ratio of thorium to uranium  and the ratio of fissionable uranium-235 to non-fissionable uranium-238  in the new fuel. So far the researchers have studied most closely a mixture  of one part uranium to three parts thorium, in which 20 percent of the  uranium is uranium-235. But the results of preliminary computer studies  indicate they may have to increase ratio of uranium to thorium to achieve  the long fuel cycles they desire.    Ultimately, the new fuel's ability to do several things better than  regular all-uranium fuel may be as attractive as its ability to lower  the price of electricity. ""Basically, we've got to cash in on some of  the subtler effects with thorium to make this pay off,"" says Michael Driscoll,  professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at MIT who is working on the  project. ""But I think there's a good chance we can make this work.""    Appealingly, the new fuel may encourage nations to use nuclear power  without helping them to develop nuclear weapons. Regular all-uranium fuel  generates plutonium-239, the preferred material for weapons, in much the  same way as the mixed fuel generates uranium-233. The new mixed fuel should  generate much less plutonium, and the plutonium it does produce should  be a mishmash of different isotopes. Thus, waste from the new fuel should  be useless for building weapons, which typically require relatively pure  plutonium-239.    For the time being the researchers will continue to study different  fuel recipes with a battery of sophisticated computer programs. Only after  they have identified an optimal mixture of thorium and uranium will the  researchers test the fuel in real reactors, most likely by inserting a  few rods of it into the core of a commercial power plant. INEEL's MacDonald  says the computational work should be completed in two or three years  and, if all goes well, reactor tests could begin a year or two after that.    But the researchers are anxious to see their idea play out. The opportunity  to help solve one of the toughest problem facing the world--how to produce  more energy and less carbon dioxide?--has given them a fresh enthusiasm  and heightened sense of purpose. ""Were not doing this because we're getting  paid to do it,"" says MacDonald, ""We're doing it because it's the right  thing to do.""

GX238-17-11274066	"Influence of co-solvent on dye solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide Hyo-Kwang Bae*, Jung-Ho Jeon and Heun Lee+ School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Yeungnam University, 214-1 Dae-dong, Kyongsan 712-749, Republic of Korea  RDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1 Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea Abstract -It is well known that the solubility of non-volatile solid such as disperse dye in a supercritical fluid is significantly increased by adding a small amount of co-solvent into the fluid. The phase equilibrium calculation for the ternary system composed of supercritical fluid, solute and co-solvent is established by using an expanded liquid model based on the regular solution coupled with Flory-Huggins theory. The solubility of non-volatile solid in ternary system including a co-solvent is correlated with the liquid model for activity coefficient with good accuracy. The model needs only the melting point and heat of fusion for the non-volatile solid that can be measured or available in literature. But the critical properties and the vapor pressure of the solid that are necessary to estimate the phase equilibrium by using a cubic equation of state are not required in this model. Key words : supercritical fluid carbon dioxide, co-solvent, disperse dye, solubility, expanded liquid model 1. Introduction Since early 1990s, supercritical fluid dyeing that uses the supercritical fluid as an alternate solvent instead of water in conventional dyeing process had been arousing much interest in textile industry because of wastewater treatment. Conventional dyeing process of polyester fiber discharges much wastewater that is contaminated by various kinds of dispersing agents, surfactants and unused dye. It is very difficult to treat the wastewater including many additives by the conventional process. The dyeing technique with supercritical fluid is an alternative one which has been developed without environmental contamination. Schollmeyer and coworkers [1-4] had established the pioneering works for the process. They reported on dyeing of GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG Q  GjGhbGTGaGg UUG XG  G   synthetic fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, polyamide and triacetate etc. by the various disperse dyes and extended the supercritical dyeing to natural fibers such as cotton and wool. They investigated the effect on the polyester pretreatment by a heat-setting process before dyeing in supercritical carbon dioxide and also reported the results of experiences with UHDE pilot plant by supercritical carbon dioxide. Chang et al. [5], Bae et al. [6] and Lee et al. [7] carried out the experiment for dyeing the polyester fibers and films by C.I. disperse red 60, orange 3, blue 3 and blue 79 disperse dyes in supercritical carbon dioxide. The supercritical condition of high temperature and pressure is necessary, at which the disperse dye can be much more solved and impregnated into the polymer fiber swelled by supercritical fluid. It is experienced that polyester fiber in supercritical carbon dioxide can be dyed over 373 K and 250 bars [5-7]. Bach et al. [8,9] had accomplished the pilot test of polyester dyeing in supercritical carbon dioxide at 393 K and 290 bars using a pilot plant. For more advanced development of the supercritical dyeing process, the dyeing process must be done possibly at lower pressure. Many investigators [5, 10-14] had reported that the solubility of solid with high-molecular weight such as disperse dye is remarkably increased by adding small amount of co-solvent. In this work, the solubility of solute in a ternary supercritical fluid + solute + cosolvent mixture is estimated by using an expanded liquid model that is considered the supercritical fluid as a liquid phase. The effect of co-solvent concentration on the solubility of solute in supercritical carbon dioxide may be predicted by the model. 2. Theoretical background The solubility of solute x 2 in mixed solvent of carbon dioxide at high pressure and a small amount of co-solvent is expressed as Eq. (1) [15].  ln x 2 =  H RT  f  1 T    T - 1 - RT  m    T  Tm  CpdT +  1 R    T  Tm  Cp dT + T    P  P2sat  v 2 dP - ln  RT  2  (1)  The second to fourth term in the right hand side of Eq. (1) contribute slightly to the result and may be neglected. The activity coefficient of species k in the mixed solvent with i and j components may be expressed, using the regular solution model coupled with Flory-Huggins theory as follow [16];  G  YG   RT ln   k  =v  k   i j    1   Aik - Aij  i j + RT  ln k + 1 - x 2 x  k   k k       (2)  The second term of right hand side of Eq. (2) represents Flory-Huggins mixing entropy of solution that is composed of the quite different size of molecules. Applying Eq. (2) to the solute in ternary supercritical carbon dioxide, solute and cosolvent system,    RT ln  2 = v 2 {A12 12 + A23 32 + ( A12 - A13 + A23 )1 2 }+ RT  ln 2 + 1 - 2  x x2  2    (3)  Subscripts 1, 2 and 3 stand for carbon dioxide, disperse dye and co-solvent respectively. If the solute is less soluble in the solvent mixed with small amount of co-solvent, Gurdial et al. [10, 18] proposed following Eq. (4) that is the similar one suggested by Myers and Prausnitz [19]. RT ln  2 = v 2 A12   [  *2 1  + A23   *2 3   *v *v * + ( A12 - A13 + A23 ) 1  * + RT  ln *3 2 + 1 - *3 2 3  x3 v 3  x3 v3  ]    (4)    Where,  * and x * are effective volume fraction and mole fraction respectively and defined as; * x3 v 3 * * * 3 = * (5) x1 + x3 = 1 (6) * x1 v1 + x3 v3 ' *  1  1 ( 2 -  3 ) ='  *  3 ( 2 -  1 ) 3 2 2 * 1 +  * = 1 3  And  (7)  (8)  Where,  ' 1 =  x1v1 x1v1 + x3 v  (9) 3  ' ' 1 +  3 = 1  (10)  The exchange energy densities A12 , A13 and A23 are represented as follows;  A12 = (  d1  -  d2 )2 +   2 p2  +  2 h2  -  12  (11)  A13 = (  d1  -  d3 )2 +   2 p3  +  2 h3  -  13  (12)  A23 = ( d 2 -  d 3 )2 + ( p2 -  p3 )2 +  h22 +  h23 - 23  (13)  The dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding components of the solubility parameter for species i are denoted by  di ,  pi  and  hi , respectively. Carbon dioxide is a  non-polar component and, therefore, the dipole and hydrogen bonding forces are  G  ZG   negligible.  d 1 is the dispersion contribution of solubility parameter of carbon dioxide which is estimated by Giddings et al.[20]. For solute and co-solvent, the dipole-dipole forces and hydrogen bonding interactions need to be considered. However, the polarity and hydrogen bonding contributions of the solutes such as disperse dyes to solubility parameter are not considered in this study, because it is known that the polarity of disperse dyes in supercritical condition is very weak. Therefore,  d is equal to the total  and evaluated by Eq. (14).   = (E / v)1 / 2 (14) E and v are estimated from the group contribution method supposed by Fedors [21].  d3  ,  h3  and   p3  of the co-solvents are evaluated with considering the  temperature effect [10]. The specific interaction parameters 12 and  23 can be easily obtained from each binary mixture consisting of ternary system. Conversely, there is no simple way of obtaining the parameter  13 . Since the molecular interactions between carbon dioxide and co-solvent are supposed weak compared to those between the solute and the co-solvent, it is assumed by Gurdial et al. [10] that the parameter is zero and omitted form the Eq. (12). But, in this work, it is regressed by the ternary data, using the determined 12 and  23 . 3. Result and Discussions 3-1. 'HWHUPLQDWLRQRI 12 from binary data Applying Eq. (2) to the solute in supercritical carbon dioxide,    RT ln  2 = v 2 ( 1 -  2 ) 2 -  12 12 + RT 1 + ln 2 -  x2 x   [  ]  2 2       (15)  is obtained. The solubility parameters  1 and  2 are evaluated by Giddings et al.[20] and by Eq.(14) respectively. 1 and  2 are volume fractions of solvent and solute respectively. 12 are regressed from the binary systems; supercritical carbon dioxide + C.I. disperse red 60[7], carbon dioxide + phenanthrene[22], carbon dioxide + fluorene[23] and carbon dioxide + acredine[23]. The obtained 12 is almost independent of temperature, but strongly dependent of density of carbon dioxide as shown Figs. 1 and 2. Therefore, 12 is correlated to the carbon dioxide density. The density of carbon dioxide is estimated by the equation of state by Huang et al. [24]. 3-2. Solubility of solute in co-solvent The second to fourth term in the right hand side of Eq. (1) contribute only slightly  G  [G   to the result and may be ignored. Hence, Eq. (1) may be expressed as  ln x 2 =  H f  T     T - 1 - ln  RT  m   2  (16)  The melting point ( Tm ) and heat of fusion at Tm ( H f ) are measured by using a differential scanning calorimeter and shown in Table 1. The activity coefficient of solute in co-solvent  2 is predicted by Eq. (2) that is applied to the binary solute + co-solvent system. The solubility of disperse dyes is measured in this work and the solubility of fluorene, phenanthrene and acridine are estimated by UNIFAC method [29]. Those are compared with the observed one in literature as shown in Table 2. Substituting the solubility in Table 2 to x 2 in Eq. (16), and replacing the obtained  2 ,  23 in Eq. (13) can be determined by using the similar expression to the Eq. (15). The parameter  23 that is determined at low pressure may be used at high pressure.  23 is nearly independent of temperature as shown in Table 2.  23 for the solution of C.I. disperse red 60 in co-solvent is almost constant even though at the different temperatures of 283.2K, 305.2K and 333.3K. The similar results [29] are reported for the solubility of naphthalene in hexane and acetone, and anthracene in acetone, diethylether and ethanol. 3-3. Comparison of the estimated with the observed solubility The obtained 12 ,  13 and  23 from binary and ternary data are substituted to Eqs. (11) to (13) to calculate A12 , A13 and A23 . Those are replaced into Eq. (4) to predict  2 . Finally, the solubility of solute is evaluated from Eq. (16). The solubility comparison of the calculated with the observed in literature can be shown in Table 3 and Figs. 3 and 4. exp AAD% in Table 3 may be enlarged, because the mole fraction of solute y 2 l in denominator is extremely small value. The results for AAD% in Table 3 may be satisfied, considering the experimental error of solubility in supercritical fluids. 4. Conclusions The solubility of non-volatile substance such as disperse dye in supercritical carbon dioxide is estimated by using an expanded liquid model to consider the supercritical fluid as a liquid phase. The results of the evaluated solubility for the supercritical carbon dioxide + solute + co-solvent ternary systems are summarized as follows; (1) 12 obtained from carbon dioxide and solute binary mixture is nearly independent of temperature, but strongly dependent of the density of carbon  G  \G   dioxide. (2) The solubility of C.I. disperse red 60 in co-solvent are measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and the parameter  23 determined from the experimental solubility are nearly constant and almost independent of temperature. (3) The solubility of non-volatile solutes such as C.I. disperse red 60, phenanthrene, fluorene and acridine can not be evaluated by the gas model using an equation of state, because the critical properties and sublimation pressure of the solutes can not be measured. But the solubility at any temperature, pressure and concentration of co-solvent can be satisfactory estimated by the expanded liquid model that needs not them.

GX231-17-7499632	Reducing raw materials cost enables affordable automotive parts Challenge  Lower-Cost Carbon Fiber Composite Materials  Raw materials account for 45-60% of the total production cost of carbon fiber composites (CFCs). Use of lower-cost feedstocks and recycling of advanced automotive parts containing CFCs could reduce raw materials cost.  Washed Hardwood Kraft Lignin Lignin content (%)  100%  95%  87.5%  75%  Technology Description Low-cost feedstocks for carbon fibers can be obtained from renewable or recycled sources. Renewable sources include lignins (paper pulping waste), reconstituted cellulosics (agricultural waste), and fiber blends of those materials. Recycled sources of petrochemical polymers include beverage bottles and composite automotive parts. The feedstock program evaluated ways of spinning highquality carbon fiber from lignin-polyolefin blends. Conventional techniques of improving fiber quality, such as hot stretching, were also explored. Another program separated carbon fibers from polymer-matrix composite (PMC) materials typical of the advanced ultra-lightweight materials used in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). This program evaluated three methods of extraction: thermal treatment, chemical degradation and thermal shock. Results obtained from these two programs can be folded into the USCAR Automotive Composites Consortium (ACC) efforts to design, analyze, and build a compositeintensive body structure.  Lignin is a low-cost, renewable feedstock for carbon fibers.  Accomplishments The low-cost feedstock program prepared and melt-spun several lignin-polyolefin blends identified as promising candidates to yield high-quality, low-cost carbon fibers. Polyethylene-lignin blends developed the finegrained microstructure conducive to production of fine, strong carbon fiber. The program extracting carbon fibers from scrap PMC found that the thermal treatment method recovered fibers from urethane-based PMCs with essentially the same density and electrical properties as fibers made from polyacr ylonitrile (PAN), the standard industr y feedstock. The process was also successful in recovering carbon fibers from epoxy-based PMCs. The ACC composite-intensive body structure program is employing computer-aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) to evaluate a variety of candidates, including carbon fiber, for the composite structures.

Future Activities The feedstock program will expand the variety of fiber blends spun and tested. Process improvements for oxidizing, hot stretching, and carbonizing the blends will be added. The process will be scaled up to permit evaluation of the mechanical properties of renewable and recyclable feedstocks. The program for recycled automotive PMC will optimize the thermal treatment reactor for operating temperature, size of PMC scrap pieces, and reactor gases. Ultimately, a conceptual pilot plant design will be developed. The ACC composite-intensive body structure program will contribute design, durability, joining, and safety research to explore the full potential of the renewable and recycled materials.

GX229-62-2992303	"Report to Congress on  Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative: The Future Path for Advanced Spent Fuel Treatment and Transmutation Research  Prepared by U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology January 2003   EXECUTIVE S  UMMARY  This report has been prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to respond to Congressional direction contained in Conference Report accompanying the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2002 (House Report 107-258)1. In that report, Congress instructed the Department to provide answers to several questions related to the agency=s spent fuel separations and transmutation research activities. Specifically, Congress directed the Department to: 1) Compare chemical and pyroprocessing, accelerator-driven transmutation, and fast reactor transmutation alternatives, including full disclosure of all waste streams; 2) Estimate the life cycle costs to construct, operate, and decommission and decontaminate all necessary facilities; 3) Compare the proliferation resistance of the various technologies; 4) Provide a strategy for siting new processing and disposal facilities that would be required for the various reprocessing and transmutation alternatives; 5) Use the once-through fuel cycle as presently used in the United States and the amount of spent nuclear fuel presently scheduled for disposal in the geologic repository as the baseline for all comparisons; and 6) Present the Department' s strategy for siting the new processing and disposal facilities that would be required for the various processing and transmutation alternatives, assuming a capacity sufficient to process the amount of spent fuel presently scheduled for geologic disposal. This report is the U.S. Department of Energy's response to the Congressional directive. It reflects strategies and approaches developed with the advice and input of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) Subcommittee on Advanced Nuclear Transformation Technology (ANTT), chaired by Nobel Laureate Dr. Burton Richter. The information presented in this report reflects the current state of the research and development knowledge on separations and transmutation technologies. While research conducted thus far by the Department and its collaborators overseas provides a basis from which some information may be derived, the Department found, in the course of attempting to respond to the questions posed by Congress, that the research is at far too early a stage to enable a meaningful or relevant response to many of the questions. Although significant progress has been made since DOE embarked on this area of work, the knowledge base, particularly with regard to life-cycle cost is limited. It is therefore important to note that the Department can only provide preliminary answers or best estimates for the questions at this time. Additional research would be required to provide a full understanding of the answers to questions about advanced fuel cycle technologies such as are posed by Congress, and the following report provides an overview of the type of research that would be needed. Therefore, we provide the  1 The exact language of the directive is contained in this report as Appendix A.   following direct responses, based on the work conducted in preparing this report, to the issues above: Issue 1: Compare chemical and pyroprocessing, accelerator-driven transmutation, and fast reactor transmutation alternatives, including disclosure of all waste streams BThe Department is sufficiently familiar with these technologies to provide a concept-level comparison of the alternatives; however, limited detail is available on issues such as costs and waste streams. As discussed in the report, the primary path for chemical spent fuel treatment, a process called ""Uranium Extraction Plus"" (UREX+), is still at a conceptual stage of development. Transmutation systems, which are largely the province of the Department=s Generation IV activities, are similarly at the very early stages of development. The information that is available regarding spent fuel processing alternatives may be found on pages II-2 through II-4 and III-4 through III-7; information regarding transmutation systems may be found on II-5 and III-7 through III10. Estimate the life cycle costs to construct, operate, and decommission and decontaminate all necessary facilitiesNo precise information on the costs of needed facilities exists today. The development of meaningful cost estimates will be a major task inherent in any future research. Compare the proliferation resistance of the various technologiesBNo metrics yet exist to provide a meaningful comparison of proliferation resistance. The Department is working with the international community to develop an agreed framework of proliferation metrics, but these are not expected to become available for at least another year or so after the issuance of this report. However, the report does highlight proliferation issues associated with spent fuel disposition on page II-6, and discusses the proliferation-resistance of advanced fuel cycle technologies on pages II-2 through II-3 and II-6. Provide a strategy for siting new processing and disposal facilities that would be required for the various reprocessing and transmutation alternativesBThis question cannot be answered until the technologies to be employed have been selected and the necessary environmental impacts studied. This report is unable to address siting issues.  Issue 2:  Issue 3:  Issue 4:  E-2   Issue 5:  Use the once-through fuel cycle as presently used in the United States and the amount of spent nuclear fuel presently scheduled for disposal in the geologic repository as the baseline for all comparisonsBThis approach is reflected in the report. For example, as highlighted in Section I, the current once-through fuel cycle produces spent nuclear fuel that requires approximately 300,000 years to decay to the toxicity level of uranium ore. If the research suggested by the report should prove successful, application of advanced fuel cycle technologies would produce waste forms that would decay to that level after only about 1,000 years. Present the Department' s strategy for siting the new processing and disposal facilities that would be required for the various processing and transmutation alternatives, assuming a capacity sufficient to process the amount of spent fuel presently scheduled for geologic disposalBClearly, as outlined in the report, the research is in far too early a stage to anticipate the siting of specific facilities. However, the Department anticipates that any advanced fuel cycle facilities built in the United States would be constructed and operated by the private sector with appropriate incentives that reflect the national benefits of implementing technology approaches to managing nuclear wastes.  Issue 6:  Continued research on the management of spent nuclear fuel is important to help the United States and other nations continue and expand the use of nuclear energy. While many countries are conducting advanced research and development on this topic, it is important for the United States to take a leadership role to ensure that advanced proliferation-resistant technologies become an integrated part of the management of spent nuclear fuel. These technologies could reduce the cost of waste disposal and also provide other benefits such as enhancing national security by significantly reducing the inventories of commercially generated plutonium in spent fuel. As discussed in the main text of this document, research thus far points to two elements of an Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) that could be conducted in parallel as part of an integrated effort. The two elements of the research consist of an intermediate-term technology, referred to as AFCI Series One, which emphasizes advanced technologies applied to current reactor technology, and a long-term technology, referred to as AFCI Series Two, which could provide for complete resolution of radiotoxicity and heat load issues. AFCI Series One would address the intermediate-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel, specifically reducing the volume of material requiring geologic disposition by extracting the uranium (which represents 96 percent of the constituents of spent nuclear fuel), and reducing the proliferation risk through the destruction of significant quantities of plutonium contained in spent nuclear fuel. These technologies could be deployed as a part of the current infrastructure and be used in concert with current and future light water reactor plants in the United States. Deployment of these technologies could occur in a time frame that would permit enhancement of the planned repository at Yucca Mountain.  E-3   AFCI Series Two would address long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel, specifically the development of fuel cycle technologies that could sharply reduce the long-term radiotoxicity and long-term heat load of high-level waste sent to a geologic repository. Because implementing these technologies would also require the successful deployment of Generation IV nuclear energy systems, this technology should be considered a longer-term option. If successful, this technology could enable the commercial waste stored in a repository to be no more toxic than natural uranium ore after approximately 1,000 years -- thereby augmenting the performance of geological disposal of nuclear wastes beyond what is now possible. Moreover, success in this area would provide a very long-term, sustainable fuel supply for expanded use of nuclear power -- one that could last hundreds of years. As described in the following report, these two elements are not independent. The objectives of advanced fuel cycle research can only be met if AFCI Series Two technologies and Generation IV nuclear energy systems are successfully developed. However, AFCI Series Two requires AFCI Series One to be practical -- Series One technologies would be needed to deal with the large volumes of radioactive materials in spent fuel. The following report provides a discussion of the issues and technologies involved in advanced fuel cycle research and charts a course for their exploration.  E-4   I. P  ROGRAM  O  VERVIEW  The Administration has concluded, as reflected in the National Energy Policy, that nuclear energy can play a strong role in the future of the Nation's energy security needs. Nuclear power is the only technology available that can produce economic, baseload quantities of energy without emitting harmful pollutants including those associated with global climate change. Nuclear power plants produce about a fifth of all U.S. electric power and do so in an economic, safe, and reliable fashion. Although nuclear energy does not emit harmful pollutants, it generates spent nuclear fuel. Disposal of this material, which is highly toxic for hundreds of thousands of years, presents a wide range of social, political, regulatory, and technical issues. Over the last three years, DOE, its laboratories, and university and private company partners have worked with the international research community to explore the potential of advanced nuclear technologies that can reduce the difficulty of disposing of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. This research, conducted under DOE's Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) Program (the program that the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, or AFCI, will replace), is designed to reduce the volume and toxicity of the nuclear waste. This report is based on the knowledge gained during that research and the results of deliberations with many experts around the world. Why Treat and Transmute Spent Fuel? The AFCI Program and related efforts in other countries are designed to find the most effective technologies to accomplish three basic steps in spent fuel treatment: 1) Reduce Spent Fuel Volume by creating a final high-level waste form that is lower in volume than the original spent fuel, 2) Separate Long-Lived, Highly Toxic Elements (i.e., actinides such as plutonium and americium) that present the most difficult disposition challenge, and 3) Reclaim Spent Fuel's Valuable Energy by providing a method to reclaim the energy value contained in the highly toxic spent fuel elements while providing for their destruction. Accomplishing these steps requires the use of complex chemical and nuclear reaction processes that can be conducted in a manner that is safe, cost effective, environmentally friendly, and proliferation-resistant. The next two sections of this document will report on DOE's efforts thus far in exploring the different technical approaches to spent fuel treatment and transmutation and outline the steps that could be considered for further development of these technologies.   It is important to recognize that even with the most ambitious goals for this research, DOE does not expect that any future spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies will obviate the need for a geologic repository. DOE believes, however, that in the long term, it may be possible to apply advanced nuclear technologies to reduce both the cost and difficulty of operating a geologic repository and the technical need to build multiple repositories in the future. Doing so could help reduce one of the main long-term barriers to the expanded use of nuclear energy. In addition to the benefits spent fuel treatment and transmutation technology could provide in terms of significantly reducing the need for a second repository, it may someday enable us to reduce the toxicity of spent fuel placed in the first geologic repository. By destroying the most toxic, long-lived radioactive components of the spent fuel, it may be possible to reduce significantly the time it takes for the commercial nuclear waste in a repository to decay to the toxicity of natural uranium ore by a factor of 300. Again, while a deep geologic repository is still needed, this technology can optimize its cost and technical performance. This report supersedes the report DOE prepared on the subject of Accelerator Transmutation of Waste in 1999. That earlier document estimated the cost of a program to develop and deploy a system of high-energy accelerator-based spent fuel treatment facilities to deal with all U.S. commercial spent fuel. Because that report examined only the deployment of accelerator-based facilities, DOE believes it was not based on a realistic approach to transmutation and is, therefore, no longer relevant to our consideration of transmutation. As indicated by the Secretary of Energy in a hearing before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water on March 6, 2002, this accelerator-only approach to transmutation could cost the United States as much as $280 billion to implement. More recent estimates, such as those performed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), suggest that employing spent fuel treatment and transmutation on a commercial scale would add at least ten percent to the overall cost of electricity. While this analysis is based on scenarios that apply to both accelerator facilities and reactor facilities, in DOE's view, this analysis is too reliant on existing spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies. We believe that any future role for these technologies will require the use of far more efficient and cost-effective technological approaches, and it is simply too early to estimate accurately the costs of spent fuel treatment and transmutation. This document describes the research program that will be required to enable an informed estimate of the potential benefits and costs of spent fuel treatment and transmutation technology. Similarly, it is far too early to rely on this emerging technology to plan for the future. For this reason, DOE believes that all analyses regarding the future of nuclear power in the United States should assume the continued use of current fuel cycle technology and the application of a deep geologic repository early in the next decade. While we recommend no change in current planning at this time, we do recognize that if nuclear power continues to operate in this country for the long term1 it will continue to produce significant quantities of spent nuclear fuel. This fact presents long-term challenges that must be addressed. 1  Even if no new nuclear power plants are constructed in the United States, the vast majority of existing plants can be expected to remain in operation into the 2030s.  I-2   The Nuclear Waste Challenge Today, the United States has 44,000 metric tonnes (Mt) of spent nuclear fuel residing at commercial nuclear power plants and generates approximately 2,000 Mt of additional spent fuel each year. At this growth rate, the statutory limit for the planned geologic repository, 63,000 Mt of civilian nuclear spent fuel, will be reached by 2015 (see Figure I-1).  Spent Fuel Waste Accumulation vs. Time 150,000 Theoretical Capacity  120,000 Retain Current Nuclear Energy Capacity  90,000 Civilian spent fuel (cumulative metric tonnes heavy metal) 60,000  Statutory Capacity of First Repository  2015  30,000  0 1980  2000 Year  2020  2040  Figure I- 1  As a result, the quantity of spent fuel produced by nuclear power plants may become a long-term challenge to the possibility of building new nuclear power plants as anticipated by the National Energy Policy. While nuclear plants produce far less waste by volume than any comparable energy-producing or industrial activity, the unique nature of spent fuel requires that dealing with this waste product be considered as part of the long-term planning for the use of nuclear power. The volume of high-level waste requiring disposal has a direct impact on the ultimate cost of a geologic repository. As more waste is sent to a repository, more emplacement tunnels (or ""drifts"") are required. Nonetheless, in the wake of September 11, 2001, it is far more desirable to move the Nation's spent nuclear fuel to a centralized, underground location than to allow it to remain at 130 locations across the country. Another factor to be considered is that after several decades out-of-reactor, spent fuel can serve as a convenient reservoir for plutonium. Figure I-2 shows that hundreds of tons of plutonium have accumulated in commercial spent fuel in the United States. With the decay, as a function of time, of the fission products that make the handling of spent fuel difficult and expensive, this  I-3   Plutonium Inventory in Commercial Spent Fuel in the U. S. 1000  Plutonium Inventory (metric tons)  630 MT in 2015 750  440 MT in 2002  500  250  1980  2000  2020  Year  Figure I- 2  material could be retrieved from a repository in 50 to 100 years and used to create separated plutonium. The United States has become increasingly concerned with the global accumulation of plutonium and believes that it presents an important proliferation issue worldwide. While spent fuel in the United States does not present a proliferation risk, only a third of the world's nuclear power plants are in the United States. Developing technologies to address this long-term threat would be in the interest of the Nation's security. Finally, in the long-term future, the world will find that uranium, like oil or natural gas, is not an infinite resource. Expert organizations such as the World Nuclear Association project that between 2050 and 2080, nuclear power plants worldwide will encounter a serious shortage in the uranium needed to produce nuclear fuel. A very recent, highly-detailed analysis performed by the industry consultancy, Energy Resources International (ERI), indicates that this vulnerability could appear even sooner under certain scenarios. As shown in Figure I-3, ERI projects that currently-known world uranium resources (including both miner and government stockpiles such as Russian highly enriched uranium) may be depleted in the coming decades to a level that could only provide about half of the annual requirements projected for 2030, assuming that nuclear fuel demand does not grow during the next few decades. This assumes that most of the already-mined uranium (excess HEU and government inventories) is largely consumed by about 2030. However, if world nuclear power grows by only 50 percent by 2030, then uranium production would have to almost triple to meet requirements. While it is generally expected that some new production resources will be found over the coming decades, this analysis demonstrates that nuclear fuel from mined uranium could become a serious restraint on the growth potential of nuclear power in the not-too-distant future.

As a result, research into technologies that can make the most efficient use of our nuclear fuel resources will support the Nation's long-term energy independence. Moreover, the 44,000 Mt of spent nuclear fuel currently stored at nuclear power plant sites across the country contain the energy equivalent to more than 6 billion barrels of oil or about two full years of U.S. oil imports. This issue, therefore, has significant energy security implications. DOE's Integrated Nuclear Research Approach DOE has embarked upon a program of research and development that can address the numerous issues facing the future of nuclear energy. In 2001, the United States and eight other countries established the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to create a common, international nuclear research and development agenda for the future (currently 10 countries are GIF members). Working in conjunction with NERAC, the GIF has developed the Generation IV Technology Roadmap. The Roadmap identifies a half-dozen nuclear energy systems that the GIF has concluded can best provide major enhancements to the use of nuclear energymeeting aggressive goals2 for economic performance, resistance to proliferation and terrorism, sustainability, and safety and reliability. If successful, this work could lead to next-generation energy sources that could produce electricity, hydrogen, and process heat economically at costs The Generation IV technology goals were drafted by the NERAC and reviewed and adopted by the 10country GIF. These goals have been accepted by organizations of the international research community, including the OECD, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and EURATOM. 2  I-5   competitive with any other energy alternative. More than a hundred scientists and engineers from all over the world have been engaged in this enterprise and the United States is now holding discussions with its partners to proceed with joint research in selected areas of mutual interest. The Roadmap is designed to consider entire nuclear systems - not just reactor technologies but fuel cycle technologies as well. Since much work has been completed under the AAA Program, the information thereby developed will be used to inform the final results of the Roadmap. The Roadmap will, in turn, inform future AFCI Program activities. The Department conducted detailed system analysis studies on various nuclear energy systems that now inform its choices for a future research agenda. These studies, which included significant and invaluable input from NERAC, examined approacheswith and without the use of accelerator driven systemsto transmute the Nation's spent nuclear fuel. These options were designed to point the way toward enhanced methods of spent fuel management that enabled the Nation to optimize its repository program while obtaining additional energy from material that would otherwise be disposed of in a repository. In the area of spent fuel treatment, the AAA Program led the development of advanced, environmentally responsible, proliferation-resistant aqueous separations technologies (Uranium Extraction technology, or ""UREX"" and UREX+). In FY 2002, initial analytical results from the hot UREX experiments carried out at the Savannah River Technology Center during August 2002, uranium recovery from actual spent light water reactor (LWR) fuel exceeded 99.9% and in the runs, the contamination of the uranium products was below current Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations for Class C waste. This successful demonstration implies that uranium from spent LWR fuel could be stored, used, or disposed of as a non high-level waste (i.e. class C low-level waste). With the results from both programs in hand thus far, it is clear that part of the long-term research agenda will include fast reactor systems (i.e., reactors that produce very high energy neutrons) working in concert with some form of advanced, proliferation-resistant spent fuel treatment. Technologies capable of destroying even very small quantities of highly toxic, longlived radioactive species in nuclear waste, such as accelerator-based systems, may also play a prominent role in these considerations. Work completed by the AAA Program and the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative has enabled DOE to identify clearly the goals and approach for research that could enable DOE, Congress, and industry to make an informed decision about the potential of advanced fuel cycle technologies. Addressing issues associated with managing high-level nuclear wastes willin both the intermediate and long terms drive the consideration of future research. In summary, the intermediate-term issues are:   reducing high-level waste volumes, increasing the capacity of the planned geologic repository,  I-6       reducing the technical need for a second repository, reducing long-term inventories of plutonium in spent fuel, and enabling recovery of the energy contained in spent fuel;  and the long-term issues are:     reducing the toxicity of spent nuclear fuel, reducing the long-term heat generation of spent nuclear fuel, providing a sustainable fuel source for nuclear energy, and supporting the future operation of Generation IV nuclear energy systems.  With this more precise definition of the program's technology objectives (made possible by the work and analyses completed by the AAA Program and the Generation IV effort), DOE believes that the AAA Program could now be succeeded by a more complete and focused effort  the AFCI. AFCI will develop advanced, proliferation-resistant technologies to treat and transmute spent nuclear fuel. It would consist of two major elements:  AFCI Series OneThis component of the program would address the intermediate-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel, primarily by reducing the volume and heat generation of material requiring geologic disposition. Doing so would support the Nation's first repository and reduce the technical need for additional repositories (about which the Department must make a recommendation between 2007 and 2010). This area of work would include exploration of proliferation-resistant processes and fuels that could enable the destruction of significant quantities of commercially generated plutonium in LWRs or high temperature gas-cooled reactors. AFCI Series TwoThis component of the program would address the long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel. Specifically, this effort would explore fuel cycle technologies that could sharply reduce the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of high-level waste sent to a geologic repository, and support development of potential Generation IV fuel cycles.    It is important to note that AFCI Series One and AFCI Series Two are complementary and, as a result, would be managed in tandem as part of a multi-phased effort to develop advanced spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies. For example, treatment technologies that emerge from AFCI Series One may prove to be invaluable front-end steps to more advanced processes targeted in AFCI Series Two. Integrating these technology programs would be essential to the success of the overall effort.  I-7   Even under the most successful scenario for this research, it will be necessary to proceed with all practical speed toward the establishment of a deep geologic repository to contain U.S. spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Even if new treatment and transmutation fuel facilities are deployed in agreement with the aggressive schedule outlined above, it will be necessary to maintain spent fuel in a safe, terrorist-proof, environmentally-responsible location for an extended period until all the fuel can be treated. Further, the outputs of transmutation, while theoretically far less toxic and toxic for a far shorter period of time than spent nuclear fuel, will still be highly radioactive for hundreds of (and likely a thousand) years. For these reasons, it makes eminent sense to proceed with the Department's geologic repository project, while maintaining the expectation that AFCI may yet significantly reduce the cost of geologic disposal while increasing its safety and proliferation-resistance. The DOE Approach to Management of the AFCI Program During the past three years, the AAA Program has developed a strong set of engineering and management teams at the national laboratories and with industry to develop the technology plans and experiments needed to address AFCI issues. These research and development teams include more than 300 scientists and technicians at various national laboratories and sites and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). DOE will continue to seek advice on the AFCI Program from the chartered subcommittee of NERAC chaired by Nobel Laureate Burton Richter. This subcommittee provides ongoing, expert advice regarding the program's technical and scientific goals and has most recently provided DOE with invaluable guidance associated with evaluating and eliminating the technical options that will form AFCI. In particular, the subcommittee's expert advice has been essential in broadening the focus of DOE's research activity from an accelerator-only focused effort to a more balanced program. As envisioned by the subcommittee, accelerator-driven systems could have an important role in a ""final burn"" that could be needed to enable the program to meet its toxicity reduction goals. A major element of the AAA Program's approach to achieving its mission in all phases has been a robust cooperative program with international partners interested in the development of this technology. To date, DOE has entered into two formal agreements for cooperative efforts with other nations to pursue these technology areas and has obtained over $100 million worth of analytical and experimental data. DOE will continue to exchange information with these international partners and will explore the potential for similar cooperation with other countries. In addition, at their 2002 summit meeting, Presidents Bush and Putin ordered their governments to prepare joint studies to outline areas of potential future cooperation on advanced, proliferation-resistant fuel cycle technologies. DOE's interaction with Russia verifies that that nation would prove a valuable partner in the U.S. AFCI Program. Russian scientists have explored a wide range of advanced fuel cycle technologies that are of considerable interest and continue to operate facilities that would be important to a future, cooperative research effort if the policy issues that currently prevent such cooperation from proceeding are cleared away.  I-8   Nonproliferation Policy Issues In addition to international policy issues, the United States would need to consider its domestic policies with regard to spent fuel treatment and transmutation. While pursuing these technologies is within the purview of the Department of Energy, deploying advanced, proliferation-resistant spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies would require a review and, where necessary, update of existing U.S. policies. As stated in the recommendations of the National Energy Policy: "" . . in the context of developing advanced nuclear fuel cycles and next generation technologies for nuclear energy, the United States should reexamine its policies to allow for research, development and deployment of fuel conditioning methods (such as pyroprocessing) that reduce waste streams and enhance proliferation resistance.""  The United States has, in the past, discouraged the use of some spent fuel technologies because of concerns regarding the proliferation characteristics of older technologies that could separate plutonium and therefore could support covert weapons activities. If research into proliferationresistant fuel cycle technologies proves successful, the United States could be in a position to make available technologies that not only avoid the problems of proliferation-prone technologies, but also enhance the proliferation characteristics of current U.S. practice. Suc h technologies cannot be ushered forth without substantial new investments in research and development. Further, to deploy these technologies would require government and industry to spend billions in new, commercial-scale plants . Refined estimates would require the research, development and design work outlined in this report.  I-9   II. AFCI S  ERIES  O  NE  The mission of AFCI Series One would be to develop proliferation-resistant technologies that could address the intermediate-term issues associated with the management of spent nuclear fuel, specifically by:   reducing the cost of spent nuclear fuel disposal by reducing the volume of high-level waste from commercial nuclear power, and reducing the long-term proliferation threat posed by plutonium contained in spent nuclear fuel.  DOE believes that, after a focused five-year research program, these new technologies can be sufficiently developed to support the Department's need to make policy recommendations to Congress between 2007 and 2010 with regard to the technical need for a second geologic repository. While there are treatment technologies used around the world today that can reduce the volume of high-level waste, they engender significant proliferation concerns that limit their widespread application. Therefore, new treatment technologies should be innately proliferation resistant and achieve our technical goals while avoiding the problems that have restricted the use of spent fuel treatment technologies in the past. Further, in order to enable the United States to consume the large inventory of fissile plutonium in commercial spent nuclear fuel in a proliferation-resistant manner, it will be necessary to develop advanced nuclear fuels that can be used in today's commercial nuclear power plants. Enhancing Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Enhancing the disposal of spent nuclear fuel could be accomplished through the use of advanced treatment and transmutation technologies. The complexities and challenges associated with the development of proliferation-resistant recycle technologies are formidable. Significant technical challenges arise from the requirement that all spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies be proliferation-resistant. Recently-developed advanced surveillance technologies must be leveraged to further ensure both the proliferation-resistance of any required fuel cycle facilities and that inherent material losses are exceptionally low .   Treatment Technologies Management of spent nuclear fuel, specifically the reduction of mass and volume of high-level nuclear waste, requires the use of treatment technologies that separate the constituents of spent nuclear fuel into (See Figure II-1):    uranium (which is approximately 96 percent of the spent fuel); short-lived radioactive elements (which decay to harmless species over few hundred years); and long-lived radioactive materials such as plutonium, americium, and other actinides. 100 Constituents of Spent Nuclear Fuel 95.6% is uranium -- can be dispositioned as Class C low-level waste or recycled 3% is stable or short-lived fission products that do not pose major disposal challenges 0.3% is cesium and strontium that decays in a few centuries (and are the primary near-term HLW heat source) 0.1% is long-lived iodine and technetium which can be transmuted 0.9% is plutonium which can be burned as fuel Uranium Fission Products Pu and Actinides 0.1% is long-lived actinides which can be fissioned in fast spectrum reactors or accelerator-driven systems (ADS)  80  Percent  60  40  20  0  Figure II-1: Spent fuel is nearly 96 percent uranium--simply removing this material would result in a dramatic reduction in the volume of nuclear waste.  Aqueous chemical treatment of various types of spent nuclear fuel has been practiced on a commercial scale in a number of countries. A treatment process known as Plutonium- URanium EXtraction (PUREX), developed by the United States in the late 1940s, is in active use on a large scale in France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. In the PUREX process, spent fuel is dissolved in acid and fed through a solvent extraction process. The process separates both uranium and plutonium. Afterward, both short and long-lived radioactive materials (neptunium, americium, etc.) are directed to a liquid waste stream, mixed with borosilicate glass, and poured into canisters where it vitrifies. This configuration is highlysuitable for long-term storage or disposal. Although PUREX can be used to reduce spent fuel volume by removing the uranium, it has two major drawbacks : it produces separated plutonium (a proliferation concern) and it generates a relatively large amount of high-level waste. In the past few years, DOE has made significant advancements in treatment technology that has both important environmental and proliferation-resistant advantages over PUREX. This treatment II-2   technology, known as URanium EXtraction (UREX), can reduce the proliferation risk by avoiding the separation of plutonium from other radioactive species  thereby rendering the plutonium unusable for weapons applications. In the UREX process, plutonium, and other transuranics, and fission products are extracted in a single stream from which transuranics could be extracted for reuse in nuclear fuel. The feature of UREX that makes it much more WHAT ARE ACTINIDES? proliferationActinides are a series of elements in the periodic table with atomic numbers resistant than between 89 and 104. They are heavy elements with similar chemical properties that resemble the rare earth (or lanthanide) series. Uranium (U), plutonium (Pu), PUREX is the neptunium (Np), americium (Am), and curium (Cm) are the actinides of importance in continual determining the long term toxicity and heat load of spent nuclear fuel. Actinides with presence of minor atomic numbers higher than uranium are called transuranics , and include Np, Pu, actinides, the high Am and Cm. Np, Am, and Cm are known as minor actinides because of their relatively low percentages in the isotopic mix in spent fuel. radioactivity and thermal characteristics of which make these materials relatively unattractive to potential proliferaters. Additionally, because UREX does not place these actinides in the waste stream, there could be a significant reduction in the amount of highlevel waste produced. Short-lived radioactive isotopes are separated and may be stored and allowed to decay to harmless elements over several decades. Further, experiments completed in 2002 have proven UREX to be capable of removing uranium from waste at such a high level of purity that we expect it to be sufficiently free of high-level radioactive contaminants to allow it to be disposed of as low-level waste or reused as reactor fuel. These laboratory-scale UREX tests have proven uranium separation at purity levels of 99.999 percent. If spent fuel were processed in this manner, the potential exists to reduce significantly the volume of high-level waste. An additional advantage of UREX is the use of acetohydroxamic acid, which enables the use of chemical processes that are far more environmentally-friendly than PUREX. AFCI Series One research would include the continued development of aqueous chemical treatment technologies including the possible demonstration of UREX at a scale relevant to its eventual commercial use. II-3   An advanced development of UREX, referred to as ""UREX+,"" would be a key element of an AFCI program. This additional research would evaluate different aqueous chemical treatment methods to separate selected actinide and fission product isotopes from the UREX stream after the uranium has been extracted in a manner that minimizes waste. For example, UREX+ would provide mixtures of plutonium and selected minor actinides for preparing proliferation-resistant fuels. Long-lived fission products, iodine-129 and technitium-99, which are major contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity from spent fuel, could be separated for incorporation into targets for destruction in reactors. This work would allow the program to obtain a detailed understanding of all waste streams, the data needed for understanding what would be needed in a commercial scale treatment facility, and provide the basis for estimating the cost to design, build, and operate such a facility. If implemented successfully, this treatment technology could significantly reduce the volume of high-level waste from commercial nuclear power (see Figure II-2). This accomplishment would reduce the cost of the first repository and potentially eliminate the technical requirement for a second .  150,000  Potential Expanded Repository Capacity  120,000 Civilian Spent Fuel, Metric Tons 90,000 Heavy Metal (Cumulative requiring repository 60,000 disposal) Retain Current Nuclear Energy Capacity Reduces Technical Need For 2nd Repository  Statutory Capacity of First Repository  2015 30,000  Impact of successful advanced recycling  0 1980 2000 2020 2040 2050  Year  Figure II-2: As an example, if AFCI technologies were commercialized in time to impact the first repository, they could provide the volume reduction required to avoid a second such facility  Key programmatic treatment technology elements for AFCI Series One would include: 1) laboratory demonstration of UREX+ using radioactive materials; 2) engineering scale demonstration of UREX+; 3) laboratory demonstration of PYROX (pyrochemical dry treatment) technology using spent LWR fuel; 4) demonstration of PYROX actinide recovery, 5) engineering scale demonstration of PYROX using radioactive materials, 6) demonstration of large-scale metal waste form technology; and 7) treatment facility requirements, costs, and design studies. Fuel Technologies II-4   The UREX treatment technology, combined with additional processing steps, provides the ability to produce proliferation-resistant transmutation fuels for use in LWRs or gas-cooled reactors. Successful implementation of this technology would require dealing with several issues such as fabrication and testing of transplutonic-bearing fuels, which would require remote fabrication. To support this effort, research on transmutation fuels would focus on the development of proliferation-resistant fuel forms, preliminary fuel irradiation testing, and analysis of the resulting transmutation system (including waste streams). In the case of LWR transmutation fuels, several technology options would be considered, including the French CORAIL, Advanced Plutonium Assembly systems, advanced assembly designs, and inert matrix/non-fertile fuel concepts. Gas-cooled reactors use very small spherical fuel particles, which if manufactured with advanced coating technology, are strong enough to permit much higher burnups than are possible with LWRs, and are difficult to reprocess. Very high destruction levels of plutonium (over 90 percent) have already been demonstrated using pure plutonium fuels; however, the challenge remains to achieve these impressive burnups with proliferation-resistant fuels. Research is needed to address this challenge and will include the development of proliferation-resistant fuel forms, fuel irradiation testing at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory or the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), and analysis of the resulting transmutation system performance for gascooled reactor fuel. WHAT IS TRANSMUTATION? Transmutation refers to the ability to transform one atom into another by changing its nuclear structure. This is accomplished by bombarding the atoms of interest with neutrons either in an accelerator or a nuclear reactor. In the context of spent nuclear fuel, transmutation can convert plutonium and other actinides into isotopes with more favorable characteristics.  II-5   Reducing the Proliferation Threat from Plutonium in Spent Nuclear Fuels There are significant proliferation concerns associated with the plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel. While it is initially difficult to covertly extract plutonium from spent fuel due to the intense radioactivity of the fission products found in spent fuel, this risk drops significantly over time. The dominant fission products producing the radiation field surrounding spent nuclear fuel are strontium-90 and cesium-137. Both species have 30-year half-lives, and as a result, the protection provided by fission product radiation is halved every 30 years. Since repositories are designed to provide safe containment for tens of thousands of years, diversion protection from the radiation field gradually becomes lower with time. As a result, the radiation levels become low enough over 50 to 100 years that the materials could be removed with manageable exposure to a potential proliferant. Current plans call for the repository to provide diversion protection through a series of costly security measures in addition to the radiation field. Transmutation provides another approach to proliferation protection that has many desirable features. Destroying plutonium using transmutation technology will significantly reduce the physical protection and material control and accounting requirements, resulting in potential cost savings in addition to reducing the proliferation risk from these materials. Energy Benefits In addition to the volume reduction and proliferation-resistance benefits described above, AFCI Series One could also recover from spent nuclear fuel certain materials, including plutonium, that could be re-used as fuel to generate additional electricity. Plutonium inventory builds up as spent fuel accumulates. Today, approximately 440 MT of plutonium are contained in spent fuel stored at various nuclear power plant sites in the United States. If this plutonium were treated and recycled into existing power plants, there would be sufficient fuel to operate all currently operating U.S. commercial nuclear plants  a fifth of the Nation's electric generation capacity  for approximately 4.5 years. Principal Science and Technology Challenges Successful implementation of AFCI Series One technologies would require the resolution of several scientific and engineering challenges. The most difficult challenges are associated with the development and design of the UREX+ processing plant and the associated fuel fabrication facility. While both of these facilities could be designed to be environmentally-friendly and proliferation-resistant, the real challenges come in the area of accomplishing these features economically, while maintaining exceptionally-low material losses. Material losses are key because they affect the radiological impact of plutonium and higher actinides. To achieve programmatic goals of reducing plutonium and minor actinides in the final waste stream to approximately 0.2 percent will be a major challenge. The second major challenge of Series One is the development and licensing of fuel (by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) to recycle plutonium and neptunium in existing or advanced light water reactors, which commercial U.S. nuclear utilities will purchase and use. Current research supports incorporating features that make this new fuel proliferation-resistant, however this aspect of the fuel also makes it more expensive to handle. Preliminary discussions with one commercial II-6   fuel supplier supports a view that this new fuel would be acceptable if the price is sufficiently less than normal commercial enriched uranium fuel to off-set costs associated with the handling of proliferation-resistant fuel. AFCI Series One fuel development, testing, and licensing activities would be designed to lead to recycle of a proliferation-resistant plutonium and neptunium fuel for use in commercial nuclear power plants. The key areas of research include; 1) determining fuel design and specifications, 2) developing fuel fabrication technologies, and 3) performing irradiation testing of sample fuel forms in the ATR at INEEL. This work would include planning and preparations for testing a Lead-Test-Assembly (LTA) in a commercial nuclear power plant and development of fuel fabrication facility conceptual design, requirements, and costs. Summary/Conclusions The goal of the AFCI Series One technology effort is to develop advanced proliferation-resistant fuel treatment technologies and the basis for transmutation fuel technologies that could be deployed in a time frame relevant to the development of the Nation's first high-level waste repository. The research and development proposed for AFCI Series One would provide the information necessary to determine whether or not to proceed to the next phase of the program that would include industrial-scale demonstrations of the processes. Significant advancements have been made at the laboratory scale for proliferation-resistant treatment technologies (UREX). This technology would require additional research and development to provide specific feed material from UREX+ to manufacture proliferation-resistant transmutation fuels for both LWRs and gas-cooled reactors. The real challenge is, therefore, the development of proliferation-resistant fuels, the fabrication of those fuels, and development of a sound basis upon which to estimate the costs associated with implementing these technologies. It should also be noted that transmutation of plutonium and other actinides contained in spent nuclear fuel in nuclear power plants could provide a 25 percent increase in the energy extracted from nuclear fuel compared to using current reactor systems with a once-through cycle. A more important contribution may come from the proliferation perspective, specifically, the elimination of much of the plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel that transmutation could make possible. The development of the Nation's first repository is quite important to the future of nuclear energy in the United States, but it has been a long and difficult process. Based on that experience, contemplating a time when a second--and perhaps more--deep geologic repository may be needed, is not a comforting prospect for those who anticipate an expanded role for nuclear energy in the future. Spent fuel treatment and transmutation can expand the technical capacity of the first repository and reduce the scientific need for a second. This technology, therefore, can help ensure that nuclear energy will be able to contribute to the Nation's energy supply far into the future.  II-7   III. AFCI S  ERIES  TWO  AFCI Series Two would focus on the development of proliferation-resistant technologies that would address the long-term issues associated with management of spent nuclear fuel, specifically, a significant reduction in the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of high-level nuclear waste. Successful deployment of AFCI Series Two technologies could:   reduce the cost of spent fuel disposal by reducing the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load, and support the development of advanced, next-generation nuclear fuel cycles that support an economic, proliferation-resistant long-term future for nuclear power.  Technology development would focus on next-generation spent nuclear fuel treatment and transmutation fuel technologies. DOE believes that sufficient information could become available from AFCI Series Two research and development to evaluate whether to proceed with the full demonstration of these technologies. Another significant research, development and design challenge necessary to support an informed What is Radiotoxicity? decision would be the Radiotoxicity refers to the direct adverse biological effect on humans of materials in development of spent nuclear fuel. The materials of long-lived toxic concern in spent fuel include preliminary design and plutonium; minor actinides such as neptunium, americium, and curium; and other long-term deployment cost toxic materials such as the radioactive fission products (e.g., iodine and technetium) estimates for required facilities and program schedules and estimation of the projected costs and benefits associated with the deployment of these technologies. In general, AFCI Series Two would focus on the fuel cycle technology associated with fast spectrum systems (which may exist in tandem with the light water or gas-cooled thermal reactors discussed in Section II of this report) and associated proliferation-resistant treatment technologies to establish an economic, closed fuel cycle. Fast reactor technology is of considerable interest to the program because, unlike light water or gas reactor technologies in use today or contemplated for near-term deployment, fast reactor systems produce very high energy neutrons that can transmute a wide array of toxic radioactive species (particularly actinides such as americium, which are generated in today's reactors). These toxic radioactive materials would otherwise exist for hundreds of thousands of years in geologic repositories. Successful deployment of AFCI Series Two technologies could provide both energy and economic benefits to the United States. Next-generation nuclear fuel technologies used in combination with advanced energy systems could extract significant additional energy from the materials in commercial nuclear power plant spent fuel while at the same time dramatically reducing both the III-1   radiotoxicity and repository heat loading. These reductions could reduce repository costs significantly. As illustrated in Figure III-1, the radiotoxicity of spent fuel declines as a function of time. Even though natural decay significantly reduces spent fuel toxicity in the very long term, a major reduction could be effected more quickly if advanced treatment and transmutation were successful in reducing the quantity of toxic material. Current commercial spent fuel placed in a repository would take about 300,000 years to decay to the same level of toxicity as natural uranium ore. Scientific investigation has demonstrated that the first repository can be sited in a manner that would isolate nuclear materials from the environment over this period.  Figure III- 1: Advanced spent fuel treatment and transmutation can lead to large reductions in the long-term radiotoxicity of materials contained in a geologic repository  III-2   Nevertheless, the successful application of advanced treatment and transmutation fuel technologies in fast spectrum reactors may result in the reduc tion of the toxicity of high-level waste from spent fuel placed in the repository to the same level as that of natural uranium ore in 1,000 years or less. This is an aggressive technology goal and achieving it would require the successful development of advanced transmutation fuels and associated treatment technologies (such as UREX) that would enable the use of fast neutron systems to destroy long-lived radioactive species. Because of the potential to use spent fuel processing and transmutation to benefit the management of radioactive waste, there is significant international interest in the AFCI Series Two research and development program. For example, France has a transmutation research program in place that began in 19911, and the European Union has implemented transmutation research in their Fifth Framework research program2. Work done by other countries is already helping DOE accelerate its research and reduce program costs. In the past two years, DOE has established international agreements with France and Switzerland on joint collaboration into transmutation technologies. To date, these agreements have provided the United States with necessary and extensive research and experimental data that would have cost over $100 million for DOE to develop on its own. DOE is also in the process of exploring opportunities for international cooperation in this topic area with other countries pursuing advanced fuel cycles. Research Effort Required to Develop Next-Generation Nuclear Fuel Technologies The research and development effort that would be required to accomplish the goals of AFCI Series Two can be best considered as a three-phase program with decision points at the end of each phase. The phases are as follows:    Phase I Basic Technology Evaluation (conducted during FY 2000 through FY 2002) Phase II Proof-of-Principle Phase III Proof-of-Performance  Phase I, the initial evaluation of technologies, was completed at the end of fiscal year 2002. During Phase I, technologies and systems have been identified that have the potential to meet the program goals to reduce waste volume, toxicity, heat generation, and proliferation risks when compared to current practices and plans. The Phase I effort has benefited from initial research and development activities conducted under the AAA Program over the last few years and from research activities conducted overseas by collaborating nations. The most promising technologies will be identified for focused research in Phase II. During Phase II, laboratory and larger scaled testing and analysis will be conducted to clarify the options and provide the information necessary to choose a path forward for Phase III, a proof-of-performance demonstration. Phase I - Basic Technology Evaluation 1 France's program was established and required by Loi no 91-381 du 30 decembre 1991 relative aux recerches sur la gestion des dechets radioactifs and its subsequent amendments. 2 Council decision of 22 December 1998 concerning the Fifth framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for research and training activities (1998 to 2002) (1999/64/Euratom), Annex II.II.(a).2.(ii).  III-3   During this phase, the basic technologies necessary to initiate activities to attain the AFCI Series Two goals were developed and evaluated. At the end of this phase, candidate systems for spent fuel treatment and transmutation that the AAA Program considered were reduced to the most promising systems for long-term development. The primary candidate systems involve fast spectrum reactors3, possibly augmented with limited accelerator-driven fast spectrum subcritical systems 4. Phase I system studies have shown that stand-alone accelerator-driven systems (ADS) are not an economically acceptable solution to deal with spent fuel5. Complexes of large ADSs would be very expensive to build and operate and would be unlikely prospects for commercial deployment. Phase I evaluations, conducted under the oversight of NERAC's Advanced Nuclear Transformation Technology Subcommittee, indicated that combined systems using commercial light water, gas-cooled, and advanced fast spectrum reactors appear to provide the most feasible and cost-effective approach to transmutation6. Application of relatively small, central ADSs could augment this approach by providing a ""final burn"" to assure the lowest possible level of long-lived radioactive elements in the final waste form. For any of these options to prove viable, they must be economically competitive with other methods of producing electricity as well as being extraordinarily safe, reliable, and proliferation resistant. Development of advanced fast spectrum reactor systems that meet these requirements is beyond the scope of AFCI; however, such technologies are included in the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems effort currently being pursued by the United States and nine partner countries. Where Generation IV is DOE's initiative to develop next-generation reactors that can be commercially-deployed, the AFCI is the complementary DOE program that will research and develop the advanced treatment technologies to prepare and process transmutation fuels for fast systems identified by the Generation IV activity.  3 Fast Spectrum Reactors (also known as fast reactors) are nuclear reactors that use the special properties of neutrons at high energy to maximize the energy withdrawn from a specific amount of uranium fuel while minimizing the total waste discharged. When a uranium atom fissions (or separates into smaller atoms) in a nuclear reactor and releases energy, neutrons are released at high energy. Fast spectrum reactors avoid using light materials, like water or hydrogen, which would slow neutrons down. 4 A sub-critical system, such as a fast spectrum accelerator, supplies the neutrons that are necessary to maintain the reaction. A critical system, such as a fast spectrum reactor, would be self-sustaining. 5 Van Tuyle, Gregory J. et at.; Candidate Approaches for an Integrated Waste Management Strategy  Scoping Evaluation; September 2001. 6 Richter, Burton, et al.; Report of the Advanced Nuclear Transformation Technology Subcommittee of the Technology Subcommittee of the Technology Subcommittee of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee; 15 April 2002; pp. 3-4.  III-4   Major accomplishments during Phase I included the following:   treatment of spent fuel to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining high purity uranium from spent fuel, successful manufacture of transmutation fuels (e.g., metal and nitride) containing various combinations of plutonium and minor actinides in preparation for irradiation testing in fiscal year 2003, building and starting operation of a lead-bismuth materials test loop at Los Alamos to investigate materials behavior in high-temperature liquid metal environments, and completion of studies that analyzed several transmutation systems to determine which have the highest potential to significantly reduce radiotoxicity.     Phase II - Proof-of-Principle Research conducted under Phase II of AFCI Series Two would be designed to determine the capability of introducing advanced transmutation systems in a cost-effective, environmentally responsible, and proliferation-resistant manner. Systems identified as the most promising during Phase I would be at the center of these investigations, and the research would determine which of these technologies could be relied upon to reduce the cost of spent fuel disposal and how significant a factor it should be in the decision regarding a second repository. (It must again be stressed, as explained in Section I (page I-8), that none of the AFCI activities discussed in this section or elsewhere in the report will have any impact on the need for the first repository.) This work would evaluate whether a full-scale demonstration of these technologies as part of a Proofof-Performance phase (Phase III) warrants consideration. The technology areas that would be pursued in Phase II include the following:    development and demonstration of advanced proliferation-resistant treatment technologies, development and testing of advanced transmutation fuels, and physics experiments and materials research related to accelerator-driven systems.  Development and Demonstration of Advanced Proliferation-Resistant Treatment Technologies AFCI Series One research on advanced proliferation-resistant treatment technologies would focus on conducting a demonstration of the UREX process to separate uranium from LWR spent nuclear fuel at a very high level of purity. Recent successful demonstration that UREX separations can achieve the required level of purity means that the UREX process developed for AFCI Series One is likely also to provide the front-end of the spent fuel treatment system needed to process transmutation fuels for AFCI Series Two. AFCI Series Two would develop advanced technologies to treat actinides for processing into proliferation-resistant fuel for fast spectrum systems. III-5   Pyroprocessing technology7, which is currently under development at Argonne National Laboratory, would be prominent among the technology approaches considered to prepare fuel for transmutation systems. The program would also investigate a new area of pyroprocessing research called ""oxide reduction,"" which would prepare spent fuel from LWRs for introduction into a pyroprocess. This new technology has the potential to replace the UREX process in AFCI Series Two. If successful, this new technology would represent an advance in efficiency and proliferation resistance over chemical methods for Series Two systems. A key item of interest in pyroprocessing treatment deals with the efficiency of the process in terms of determining whether the losses of material from the pyroprocess are sufficiently small and whether the resultant waste forms are acceptable to the repository. This work would be completed in Phase II and would be an alternative for consideration in selecting a system concept to be pursued in Phase III. In addition to pyroprocessing techniques, AFCI Series Two could engage the international community in a full exploration of other advanced treatment options. One area that could be explored includes techniques known as ""fluoride volatility"" processes that involve the fluorination of spent fuel with fluorine gas and the subsequent separation of resultant volatile compounds (e.g., UF6) from non-volatile (e.g., PuF4) compounds of fluorine. This technology has considerable promise as a proliferation-resistant means of treating spent fuel while minimizing the generation of nuclear wastes. Another interesting advanced technology concept is being pursued at the Russian Research Center ""Kurchatov Institute"" and applies a plasma process to treat spent fuel. Which of the various advanced approaches to fuel treatment would be selected for long-term development remains a subject of further exploration. AFCI is designed with the recognition that both ""dry"" processes (like pyroprocessing) and aqueous processes (like UREX+) may be needed to serve complementary roles in an advanced treatment system. While these technologies are not necessarily competitive options in AFCI Series Two, they do have very different characteristics. Pyroprocessing, for example, operates at high temperatures compared to aqueous processes, and is not designed to remove pure plutonium during the treatment of spent fuel  which makes the fuel derived from the spent fuel too radioactive to facilitate its use in weapons . However, it has never been proven to operate at commercial scales, though experiments and work performed by DOE over the last several years point to the technical issues that would need to be resolved to support larger-scale activities. As an aqueous process, UREX+ can be assumed to be similar in some respects to commercial technologies in use in Europe. Experts consulted for this report believe that UREX+ plants could be built to handle commercial scale spent fuel treatment (e.g., 1,500 to 2,000 metric tonnes per year). On the other hand, pyroprocessing is better suited for dealing with large concentrations of transuranics, and hence best suited for fast spectrum reactor systems. Pyroprocessing also facilitates the fabrication of metal fuels, which may prove essential in fast reactor systems. The following accomplishments are anticipated during Phase II in the advanced proliferationresistant treatment technologies area:  7 Pyroprocessing (also known as electrometallurgical treatment) is a process used to separate fuel elements discharged from a nuclear reactor into two separate sets of material: fuel material that can be recycled back into the reactor and waste material that is disposed. The pyroprocess places fuel elements in a liquid salt bath and uses electrical current to draw the different components of the fuel element towards separate collection areas.  III-6       investigation and selection of an advanced separations technology for long-term application, development and hot demonstration of an electrochemical oxide reduction and electrorefining process to enable separation of actinides from fission products, and hot demonstration of a process to prepare actinides from LWR spent fuel for transmutation.  Development and Testing of Advanced Transmutation Fuels While plutonium-based fuels have been manufactured on a commercial basis, almost no work has been done on making or irradiating fuels that contain neptunium, americium, or curium. Transmutation fuels that can significantly destroy the higher actinides should be capable of very high burnups to minimize the number of recycles in order to reduce material losses due to separations and refabrication processes. They would also need to be easily fabricated in hot cells or some other remote environment due to the high radiation levels from the minor actinides. If these advanced fuels are to be useful candidates for potential deployment with Generation IV type systems , research, development, and testing would be needed beyond Phase II. AFCI Series Two would apply considerable effort to evaluating the various fuel types that could serve as an optimum fuel for fast spectrum reactor or accelerator-driven transmutation systems. The determination of the optimum fuel form for transmutation  a fuel that may be easily fabricated using remote handling technologies, contributes to the safe operation of the reactor, and results in a final waste form acceptable for Yucca Mountain  is a major research objective of the program. Oxide, nitride, metallic, dispersion, ceramic, and coated particle fuel forms are currently under investigation. Fabrication of several test fuel specimens of these fuel forms containing plutonium mixed with minor actinides is underway. The Department plans to irradiate these fuels in the ATR in Idaho in fiscal year 2003, with a more ambitious follow-on irradiation program to be carried out in France by other European partners. A consortium of institutions is planning the construction of an experimental assembly containing minor actinide fuels that would come from several countries; this assembly would be irradiated in a French fast spectrum reactor (PHENIX) . Successful testing in the ATR and initiation of the French PHENIX tests during Phase II would permit DOE to select the most promising path forward for AFCI Series Two transmutation fuels including planning for potential Phase III scaled-up fast spectrum irradiations in foreign facilities. Fast spectrum systems can be either fast reactors (which employ critical reactor cores that operate 12-to-18 months between refueling cycles) or accelerator-driven systems that employ reactor cores that are sub-critical by nature (i.e., they need a constant source of neutrons to maintain a normal operating state). The external source of neutrons is produced by an accelerator and a target system. Both systems employ fast neutrons; however the accelerator system has the advantage that it can totally transmute all radioactive elements without producing any plutonium in the process. Accelerator systems are more expensive than fast reactors, and require significantly more research and development, although the fuel technology is basically the same. While the Department, based on the systems analysis carried out in Phase I of this research endeavor, does not expect accelerator transmutation systems to be used as the primary transmuters of the long-lived toxic materials present in spent fuel, they may have an important role in assuring III-7   the very low levels of toxicity that serve as the technology goals of this activity8. The relatively high construction and operating costs of accelerator-based systems make them unsatisfactory for wide-spread application as commercial-scale transmuters. Fast reactor systems, however, may prove sufficiently economic to justify their eventual deployment--this is a key element of evaluation in the multinational Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative. (The Generation IV International Forum: Update, October 2002 is included as Appendix B.) The following accomplishments would be anticipated during Phase II in the advanced transmutation fuels technology area:  screening irradiation tests of several fuel forms in the ATR and post-irradiation examination and analysis to help select fuels for the follow-on proof-of-performance Phase III; fabrication and initiation of screening irradiation tests of several fuel forms in the French PHENIX fast test reactor; fabrication and initiation of irradiation testing of gas-cooled reactor TRISO particle transmutation fuel for use in a fast neutron spectrum; development of process flow sheets and relative capital and production costs for fabrication of the several candidate fuel types; measurement and characterization of the physical, chemical, and thermal properties of transmutation fuel types and their incorporation into a Fuels Handbook; and development and validation of predictive fuel performance and properties using ATR test fuel irradiation data.        Accelerator Driven Systems Physics and Materials Research and Development Many countries are considering ADSs as a viable approach to transmutation because these systems may be capable of destroying long-lived radioactive isotopes of all types without making plutonium. An accelerator driven system consists of an accelerator that produces high energy protons that strike a heavy metal target to produce high energy (fast) neutrons through a spallation process to drive a subcritical reactor assembly. This research includes understanding the physics of coupled accelerator-driven fast spectrum systems and the related spallation target and materials issues. The United States has been able to acquire valuable experimental data from French researchers and from projects funded by the European Commission that would reduce the cost of this program. In addition, UNLV has been conducting research in several areas related to accelerator driven systems . Of primary importance, to the program, UNLV has been conducting basic research in the area of lead-bismuth corrosion technology. This research not only supports accelerator driven systems , but also supports development of Generation IV energy systems.  8 Richter, et al. Op. Cit.  III-8   A critical Phase II physics experiment would couple an accelerator with a subcritical multiplier test facility in Europe or possibly in this country in the TREAT facility in Idaho. This activity would provide crucial physics information required to design and safely operate accelerator driven systems . Spallation target materials are also being developed for use as a coupling device between an accelerator and a fast spectrum reactor. In Phase II, a decision would need to be made on whether lead-bismuth is acceptable for the target material or a sodium cooled-tungsten target configuration is needed. The program has built and initiated operation of a lead-bismuth Materials Test Loop that is currently providing important data needed to operate large spallation targets. In collaboration with Swiss, French, German, and Italian organizations, DOE is participating in the construction of a powerful spallation target that is planned to be operating by 2005 and that would provide experimental data needed for the Phase II materials decisions. High temperature behavior of materials in a fast spectrum system would also be evaluated in Phase II. Regardless of the path forward chosen after Phase II, the information derived in this work area should facilitate more efficient and economic designs in Phase III. The following accomplishments are anticipated during Phase II in the ADS Physics and Materials Research and Development area:     completion of tests on the safe operation and controllability of a coupled accelerator driven subcritical multiplier system; completion of materials corrosion, thermo-hydraulics, thermodynamic, and irradiation tests of lead bismuth-cooled systems needed to select reference target and multiplier configuration to be used in the proof-of-performance demonstration phase; and completion of integral spallation target testing at the MEGAPIE facility in Switzerland.  Phase III - Proof-of-Performance A decision to proceed to Phase III, a full-scale Proof-of-Performance demonstration, would be based on information developed in Phase II. Conclusions made in Phase II that would support moving forward with Phase III include final selection and development of an advanced treatment process, selection and demonstration of optimum fuel forms, selection of an ideal ADS target material, and a comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of each of the alternatives to complete a proof-of-performance and to proceed with implementation. The goal of Phase III  III-9   would be to complete confirmatory testing of selected spent fuel treatment and transmutation fuel technologies and to resolve design and engineering issues through full-scale demonstrations . A series of tests, including irradiation and recycling, would be performed to demonstrate fast spectrum irradiation and fuel cycle processing capabilities and provide a firm basis for estimating the economic and environmental impacts of these technologies. New, scalable fuel fabrication, treatment, and fast spectrum test facilities in the United States or in partner countries would likely be needed to complete this work. At the end of this phase, all major technical, design, economic, and engineering issues associated with the fuel cycles investigated in Phases II and III would be resolved. Additionally, data would be available to define an architecture for commercial deployment with considerable confidence regarding system costs and performance. The Phase III technology development goal, if accomplished on a timely basis, would provide confirmation of the advanced fuel cycle designs required for successful implementation of Generation IV systems. Because it is likely that new facilities would be required to demonstrate the commercial viability of AFCI technologies, while also resolving key engineering and operations issues, the program would continue its strong international cooperative program during Phase III. Even at this early stage of the program's development, France has expressed interest in such cooperative efforts. International research, development and design collaborations would be essential because of the complexity and challenges associated with proliferation-resistant recycling technologies. Particularly important would be the goal of achieving material losses low enough to assure that the relative toxicity of the resulting waste (destined for the repository) could decay to a toxicity level equivalent to that of natural uranium within 1,000 years. Furthermore, international partners such as France have extensive experience in recycle technologies. The AFCI program would seek to combine the experience of these partners with the program's own new challenging research, development and design to achieve cost-effective and environmentally-friendly construction and operation of AFCI facilities. Principal Science and Technology Challenges Successful implementation of Series Two technologies would also require resolution of several scientific and engineering challenges. In Series Two, the most difficult challenges are associated with developing and designing commercial-scale advanced fuel treatment processes that are economic and proliferation-resistant--that is, exceptionally low materials losses. Current research supports the ability to incorporate proliferation-resistance, however to do so economically is the challenge. Research and demonstration of a scaled facility would be required to understand fully the commercial feasibility of this technology. The second major challenge of Series Two would be the development and licensing of Generation IV transmutation fuel and the associated materials issue. While the metal fuel form is well understood, the more advanced fuels, such as nitride fuels, provide the promise of exceptionally high burn-up, which improves the transmutation rate. Achieving this benefit, however, requires major advancements in fuel cladding materials issues.  III-10   The third major challenge of Series Two would be the development of coupled spallationtarget/sub-critical reactor cores, and their associated systems. Achievement of this requirement would depend on the selection of accelerator-driven systems for the final burn. If systems studies support this technology, then this challenge must be met. Transmutation Technology Development Research and development for AFCI Series Two transmutation technology development would cover three major areas: 1) transmutation physics, 2) transmutation materials, and 3) accelerator driven systems. Transmutation physics focuses on research to provide critical nuclear crosssection data in the thermal, epithermal, and fast neutron spectra. This data is needed to ensure that transmutation rates and criticality uncertainties are understood. Analysis codes will be validated against experimental data. Transmutation materials activities will focus on; 1) analysis of the degradation of structural materials in fast neutron spectrum and accelerator generated protons and neutrons, and 2) coolant technology for critical and non-critical reactor systems. Material damage limits will be established to determine the extent to which these systems can operate before requiring replacement. Transmutation using accelerator driven systems would focus primarily on international collaboration, such as the ""MEGAPIE"" lead-bismuth spallation target experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute, and the European ""TRADE"" experiment in Italy. These collaborations will level European research investments at a fraction of the cost of conducting the experiment. Summary/Conclusions AFCI Series Two would consist of a phased approach to developing the technologies needed to address the long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel management --- namely, reducing the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load. It is clear that fast neutron spectrum systems would be required to adequately destroy the long-lived toxic actinides and fission products of concern in spent fuel. During the AFCI Series Two research and development effort, advanced treatment technology and fast spectrum transmutation systems (reactors or accelerators) would be developed to achieve this goal while at the same time supporting the development of advanced, nextgeneration nuclear fuel cycles that can support an economic, proliferation-resistant long-term future for nuclear power. Should AFCI Series Two proceed to Phase III (""Proof-of-Performance""), the research would provide a practical demonstration of transmutation technologies and develop the detailed information needed for their commercial deployment including their specific capabilities, operational methods, waste characteristics, and estimated volumes, costs, designs, hardware, software, and facility requirements. Successful deployment of these technologies could provide the Nation with the capability to destroy the long-lived toxic materials in spent fuel through the use of fast spectrum systems that offer the potential for new nuclear energy systems that minimize waste and eliminate or significantly reduce the technical need for a second geologic repository.  III-11   Report to Congress on  Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative: The Future Path for Advanced Spent Fuel Treatment and Transmutation Research  Appendix A      Report to Congress on  Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative: The Future Path for Advanced Spent Fuel Treatment and Transmutation Research  Appendix B   Generation IV International Forum: Update October 2002  Summary The ten member countries of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) have selected six next generation nuclear energy system concepts, known as Gen IV, to be the focus for collaborative research and development. The GIF, an international collective dedicated to the development by 2030, of the next generation of nuclear reactor and fuel cycle technologies, was announced by US Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, on July 23, 2001, following a meeting of the GIF Policy Group. The member countries of the GIF are: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. The six Gen IV systems were selected by GIF with the help of leading international experts because of their significant potential to advance the sustainability, safety, economics and proliferation resistance of future nuclear systems. As well as electricity generation, the plants offer potential for the generation of hydrogen from water for use in transport and for water desalination. All are considered deployable by at least 2030, with some possibly available as early as 2020. The concepts include a sodium liquid metal-cooled reactor, very high temperature reactor, supercritical water-cooled reactor, lead-alloy-cooled reactor, gas-cooled fast reactor, and molten salt reactor. Generation IV Technology Goals The six Generation IV systems selected by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) countries meet challenging technology goals such as sustainability, economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance and physical protection. By striving to meet the technology goals, new nuclear systems can achieve a number of long-term benefits that will help nuclear energy play an essential role worldwide. Sustainable Nuclear Energy Sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the present generation while enhancing the ability of future generations to meet society's needs indefinitely into the future. The benefits of meeting sustainability goals include:  Having a positive impact on the environment through the displacement of polluting energy and transportation sources by nuclear electricity generation and nuclearproduced hydrogen; Allowing geologic waste repositories to accept the waste of many more plant-years of nuclear plant operation through substantial reduction in the amount of wastes and their decay heat; Greatly simplifying the scientific analysis and demonstration of safe repository performance for very long time periods (beyond 1000 years), by a large reduction in the lifetime and toxicity of the residual radioactive wastes sent to repositories for final geologic disposal; Extending the nuclear fuel supply into future centuries by recycling used fuel to recover its energy content, and by converting 238U to new fuel.         Competitive Nuclear Energy Economic goals broadly consider competitive costs and financial risks of nuclear energy systems. The benefits of meeting economic goals include:  Achieving economic life-cycle and energy production costs through a number of innovative advances in plant and fuel cycle efficiency, design simplifications, and plant sizes; Reducing economic risk to nuclear projects through innovative advances that may be possible with the development of plants built using innovative fabrication and construction techniques, and modular plants; Allowing the distributed production of hydrogen, fresh water, district heating, and other energy products to be produced where they are needed.      Safe and Reliable Systems Safe and reliable operation of nuclear systems is an essential priority in the development of next-generation systems. Goals broadly consider safe and reliable operation, improved accident management and minimization of consequences, investment protection, and reduced need for off-site emergency response. The benefit of meeting these goals includes:   Increasing the use of inherent safety features, robust designs, and transparent safety features that can be understood by nonexperts; Enhancing public confidence in the safety of nuclear energy.  Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection Proliferation resistance and physical protection consider means for safeguarding nuclear material and nuclear facilities. The benefits of meeting these goals include:   Providing continued effective proliferation resistance of nuclear energy systems through the increased use of intrinsic barriers and extrinsic safeguards; Increasing physical protection against terrorism by increasing the robustness of new facilities.  Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Generation IV nuclear energy systems comprise the nuclear reactor and its energy conversion systems, as well as the necessary facilities for the entire fuel cycle, from ore extraction to final waste disposal. The following six systems, listed alphabetically, were selected as the most promising Generation IV concepts by the GIF: Generation IV System Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor System Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor System Molten Salt Reactor System Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor System Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor System Very-High-Temperature Reactor System Acronym GFR LFR MSR SFR SCWR VHTR   GFR  Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor System The GFR system features a fast-neutron-spectrum helium-cooled reactor [shown below] and closed fuel cycle. Like thermal-spectrum helium-cooled reactors, the high outlet temperature of the helium coolant makes it possible to deliver electricity, hydrogen, or process heat with high efficiency. The reference reactor is a 288-MWe helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850C using a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are candidates that hold the potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. Core configurations may be based on prismatic blocks, pin- or plate-based fuel assemblies. The GFR reference has an integrated, on-site spent fuel treatment and refabrication plant. The GFR uses a direct-cycle helium turbine for electricity generation, or can optionally use its process heat for thermochemical production of hydrogen. Through the combination of a fast spectrum and full recycle of actinides, the GFR minimizes the production of long-lived radioactive waste. The GFR's fast spectrum also makes it possible to utilize available fissile and fertile materials (including depleted uranium) considerably more efficiently than thermal spectrum gas reactors with once-through fuel cycles.   LFR  Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor System The LFR system features a fast-spectrum lead or lead/bismuth eutectic liquid metal-cooled reactor and a closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium and management of actinides. The system has a full actinide recycle fuel cycle with central or regional fuel cycle facilities. Options include a range of plant ratings, including a battery of 50-150 MWe [shown below] that features a very long refueling interval, a modular system rated at 300-400 MWe, and a large monolithic plant option at 1200 MWe. The term battery refers to the longlife, factory fabricated core, not to any provision for electrochemical energy conversion. The fuel is metal or nitride-based, containing fertile uranium and transuranics. The LFR is cooled by natural convection with a reactor outlet coolant temperature of 550C, possibly ranging up to 800C with advanced materials. The higher temperature enables the production of hydrogen by thermochemical processes. The LFR battery is a small factory-built turnkey plant operating on a closed fuel cycle with very long refueling interval (15 to 20 years) cassette core or replaceable reactor module. Its features are designed to meet market opportunities for electricity production on small grids, and for developing countries who may not wish to deploy an indigenous fuel cycle infrastructure to support their nuclear energy systems. The battery system is designed for distributed generation of electricity and other energy products, including hydrogen and potable water.   MSR  Molten Salt Reactor System The MSR system produces fission power in a circulating molten salt fuel mixture with an epithermal-spectrum reactor [shown below] and a full actinide recycle fuel cycle. In the MSR system, the fuel is a circulating liquid mixture of sodium, zirconium and uranium fluorides. The molten salt fuel flows through graphite core channels, producing an epithermal spectrum. The heat generated in the molten salt is transferred to a secondary coolant system through an intermediate heat exchanger, and then through a tertiary heat exchanger to the power conversion system. The reference plant has a power level of 1000 MWe. The system has a coolant outlet temperature of 700C, possibly ranging up to 800C, affording improved thermal efficiency. The closed fuel cycle can be tailored to the efficient burnup of plutonium and minor actinides. The MSR's liquid fuel allows addition of actinides such as plutonium and avoids the need for fuel fabrication. Actinides and most fission products form fluorides in the liquid coolant. Molten fluoride salts have excellent heat transfer characteristics and a very low vapor pressure, which reduce stresses on the vessel and piping.   SFR  Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor System The SFR system features a fast-spectrum sodium-cooled reactor [shown below] and a closed fuel cycle for efficient management of actinides and conversion of fertile uranium. The fuel cycle employs full actinide recycle with two major options: One is an intermediate size (150 to 500 MWe) sodium-cooled reactor with a uranium-plutonium-minor-actinide-zirconium metal alloy fuel, supported by a fuel cycle based on pyrometallurgical processing in facilities integrated with the reactor. The second is a medium to large (500 to 1500 MWe) sodiumcooled reactor with mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel, supported by a fuel cycle based upon advanced aqueous processing at a central location serving a number of reactors. The outlet temperature is approximately 550C for both. The SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes and, in particular, management of plutonium and other actinides. Important safety features of the system include a long thermal response time, a large margin to coolant boiling, a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure, and an intermediate sodium system between the radioactive sodium in the primary system and the water and steam in the power plant. With innovations to reduce capital cost, the SFR can serve markets for electricity. The SFR's fast spectrum also makes it possible to utilize available fissile and fertile materials (including depleted uranium) considerably more efficiently than thermal spectrum reactors with once-through fuel cycles.   SCWR  Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor System The SCWR system is a high-temperature, high-pressure water-cooled reactor [shown below] that operates above the thermodynamic critical point of water (374C, 22.1 MPa or 705F, 3208 psia). The supercritical water coolant enables a thermal efficiency about one-third higher than current light water reactors, as well as simplifications in the balance of plant. The balance of plant is considerably simplified because the coolant does not change phase in the reactor and is directly coupled to the energy conversion equipment. The reference system is 1700 MWe with an operating pressure of 25 MPa, and a reactor outlet temperature of 510C, possibly ranging up to 550C. The fuel is uranium oxide. Passive safety features are incorporated similar to those of simplified boiling water reactors. The SCWR system is primarily designed for efficient electricity production, with an option for actinide management based on two options in the core design: the SCWR may have a thermal or fast-spectrum. Thus, the system offers two fuel cycle options: the first is an open cycle with a thermal-spectrum reactor; the second is a closed cycle with a fast- spectrum reactor and full actinide recycle based on advanced aqueous processing at a central location.   VHTR  Very-High-Temperature Reactor System The VHTR is a graphite-moderated, helium-cooled reactor [shown below] with a oncethrough uranium fuel cycle. It supplies heat with core outlet temperatures of 1000oC, which enables applications such as hydrogen production or process heat for the petrochemical industry or others. The reference reactor is a 600 MWth core connected to an intermediate heat exchanger to deliver process heat. The reactor core can be a prismatic block core such as the operating Japanese HTTR, or a pebble-bed core such as the operating Chinese HTR-10. For hydrogen production, the system supplies heat that could be used efficiently by the thermochemical iodine-sulfur process. The VHTR system is designed to be a high-efficiency system that can supply process heat to a broad spectrum of high-temperature and energy-intensive, nonelectric processes. The system may incorporate electricity generating equipment to meet cogeneration needs. The system also has the flexibility to adopt U/Pu fuel cycles and offer enhanced waste minimization. Thus, the VHTR offers a broad range of process heat applications and an option for high efficiency electricity production, while retaining the desirable safety characteristics offered by modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactors."

Certain isotopes of some elements can be split and will release part of their energy as heat. This splitting is called fission. The heat released in fission can be used to help generate electricity in powerplants. Uranium-235 (U-235) is one of the isotopes that fissions easily. During fission, U-235 atoms absorb loose neutrons. This causes U-235 to become unstable and split into two light atoms called fission products. The combined mass of the fission products is less than that of the original U-235. The reduction occurs because some of the matter changes into energy. The energy is released as heat. Two or three neutrons are released along with the heat. These neutrons may hit other atoms, causing more fission.  A series of fissions is called a chain reaction. If enough uranium is brought together under the right conditions, a continuous chain reaction occurs. This is called a self-sustaining chain reaction. A self-sustaining chain reaction creates a great deal of heat, which can be used to help generate electricity. Nuclear powerplants generate electricity like any other steam-electric powerplant. Water is heated, and steam from the boiling water turns turbines and generates electricity. The main difference in the various types of steam-electric plants is the heat source. Heat from a selfsustaining chain reaction boils the water in a nuclear powerplant. Coal, oil, or gas is burned in other powerplants to heat the water.  ii  iii   Preface The concept of the atom has existed for many centuries. But we only recently began to understand the enormous power contained in the tiny mass. In the years just before and during World War II, nuclear research focused mainly on the development of defense weapons. Later, scientists concentrated on peaceful applications of nuclear technology. An important use of nuclear energy is the generation of electricity. After years of research, scientists have successfully applied nuclear technology to many other scientific, medical, and industrial purposes. This pamphlet traces the history of our discoveries about atoms. We begin with the ideas of the Greek philosophers. Then we follow the path to the early scientists who discovered radioactivity. Finally, we reach modern-day use of atoms as a valuable source of energy. This pamphlet also includes a detailed chronology of the history of nuclear energy and a glossary. We hope the glossary will explain terms that may be new to some readers and that studying the chronology will encourage readers to explore the resources listed in the bibliography. By doing so, you can discover first-hand our nation's efforts to develop and control this powerful technology.  1   Introduction It is human nature to test, to observe, and to dream. The history of nuclear energy is the story of a centuries-old dream becoming a reality. Ancient Greek philosophers first developed the idea that all matter is composed of invisible particles called atoms. The word atom comes from the Greek word, atomos, meaning indivisible. Scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries revised the concept based on their experiments. By 1900, physicists knew the atom contains large quantities of energy. British physicist Ernest Rutherford was called the father of nuclear science because of his contribution to the theory of atomic structure. In 1904 he wrote: If it were ever possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small amount of matter. Albert Einstein developed his theory of the relationship between mass and energy one year later. The mathematical formula is E=mc 2, or ""energy equals mass times the speed of light squared."" It took almost 35 years for someone to prove Einstein's theory.  3   The Discovery Of Fission In 1934, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted experiments in Rome that showed neutrons could split many kinds of atoms. The results surprised even Fermi himself. When he bombarded uranium with neutrons, he did not get the elements he expected. The elements were much lighter than uranium.  These elements had about half the atomic mass of uranium. In previous experiments, the leftover materials were only slightly lighter than uranium. Hahn and Strassman contacted Lise Meitner in Copenhagen before publicizing their discovery. She was an Austrian colleague who had been forced to flee Nazi Germany. She worked with Niels Bohr and her nephew, Otto R. Frisch. Meitner and Frisch thought the barium and other light elements in the leftover material resulted from the uranium splitting -- or fissioning. However, when she added the atomic masses of the fission products, they did not total the uranium's mass. Meitner used Einstein's theory to show the lost mass changed to energy. This proved fission occurred and confirmed Einstein's work.  The First Self-Sustaining Chain Reaction Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist, led the team of scientists who created the first selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction.  In the fall of 1938, German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman fired neutrons from a source containing the elements radium and beryllium into uranium (atomic number 92). They were surprised to find lighter elements, such as barium (atomic number 56), in the leftover materials. 4  In 1939, Bohr came to America. He shared with Einstein the Hahn-Strassman-Meitner discoveries. Bohr also met Fermi at a conference on theoretical physics in Washington, D.C. They discussed the exciting possibility of a selfsustaining chain reaction. In such a process, atoms could be split to release large amounts of energy. Scientists throughout the world began to believe a self-sustaining chain reaction might be possible. It would happen if enough uranium could be brought together under proper conditions. The amount of uranium needed to make a self-sustaining chain reaction is called a critical mass.  5   Fermi and his associate, Leo Szilard, suggested a possible design for a uranium chain reactor in 1941. Their model consisted of uranium placed in a stack of graphite to make a cube-like frame of fissionable material.  On the morning of December 2, 1942, the scientists were ready to begin a demonstration of Chicago Pile-1. Fermi ordered the control rods to be withdrawn a few inches at a time during the next several hours. Finally, at 3:25 p.m., Chicago time, the nuclear reaction became self-sustaining. Fermi and his group had successfully transformed scientific theory into technological reality. The world had entered the nuclear age.  The Development Of Nuclear Energy For Peaceful Applications The first nuclear reactor was only the beginning. Most early atomic research focused on developing an effective weapon for use in World War II. The work was done under the code name Manhattan Project.  Leo Szilard  Early in 1942, a group of scientists led by Fermi gathered at the University of Chicago to develop their theories. By November 1942, they were ready for construction to begin on the world's first nuclear reactor, which became known as Chicago Pile-1. The pile was erected on the floor of a squash court beneath the University of Chicago's athletic stadium. In addition to uranium and graphite, it contained control rods made of cadmium. Cadmium is a metallic element that absorbs neutrons. When the rods were in the pile, there were fewer neutrons to fission uranium atoms. This slowed the chain reaction. When the rods were pulled out, more neutrons were available to split atoms. The chain reaction sped up. 6  Lise Meitner and Otto R. Frisch  7   However, some scientists worked on making breeder reactors, which would produce fissionable material in the chain reaction. Therefore, they would create more fissionable material than they would use.  Federal nuclear energy programs shifted their focus to developing other reactor technologies. The nuclear power industry in the U.S. grew rapidly in the 1960s. Utility companies saw this new form of electricity production as economical, environmentally clean, and safe. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, growth slowed. Demand for electricity decreased and concern grew over nuclear issues, such as reactor safety, waste disposal, and other environmental considerations. Still, the U.S. had twice as many operating nuclear powerplants as any other country in 1991. This was more than one-fourth of the world's operating plants. Nuclear energy supplied almost 22 percent of the electricity produced in the U.S.  Enrico Fermi led a group of scientists in initiating the first selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction. The historic event, which occurred on December 2, 1942, in Chicago, is recreated in this painting.  After the war, the United States government encouraged the development of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. Congress created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1946. The AEC authorized the construction of Experimental Breeder Reactor I at a site in Idaho. The reactor generated the first electricity from nuclear energy on December 20, 1951. A major goal of nuclear research in the mid-1950s was to show that nuclear energy could produce electricity for commercial use. The first commercial electricity-generating plant powered by nuclear energy was located in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. It reached its full design power in 1957. Light-water reactors like Shippingport use ordinary water to cool the reactor core during the chain reaction. They were the best design then available for nuclear powerplants. Private industry became more and more involved in developing light-water reactors after Shippingport became operational.  The Experimental Breeder Reactor I generated electricity to light four 200-watt bulbs on December 20, 1951. This milestone symbolized the beginning of the nuclear power industry.  8  9   At the end of 1991, 31 other countries also had nuclear powerplants in commercial operation or under construction. That is an impressive worldwide commitment to nuclear power technology. During the 1990s, the U.S. faces several major energy issues and has developed several major goals for nuclear power, which are: u To maintain exacting safety and design standards; u To reduce economic risk; u To reduce regulatory risk; and u To establish an effective high-level nuclear waste disposal program. Several of these nuclear power goals were addressed in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which was signed into law in October of that year. The U.S. is working to achieve these goals in a number of ways. For instance, the U.S. Department of Energy has undertaken a number of joint efforts with the nuclear industry to develop the next generation of nuclear powerplants. These plants are being designed to be safer and more efficient. There is also an effort under way to make nuclear plants easier to build by standardizing the design and simplifying the licensing requirements, without lessening safety standards. In the area of waste management, engineers are developing new methods and places to store the radioactive waste produced by nuclear plants and other nuclear processes. Their goal is to keep the waste away from the environment and people for very long periods of time. 10  Scientists are also studying the power of nuclear fusion. Fusion occurs when atoms join -- or fuse -- rather than split. Fusion is the energy that powers the sun. On earth, the most promising fusion fuel is deuterium, a form of hydrogen. It comes from water and is plentiful. It is also likely to create less radioactive waste than fission. However, scientists are still unable to produce useful amounts of power from fusion and are continuing their research.  In Oak Ridge, Tennessee, workers package isotopes, which are commonly used in science, industry, and medicine.  11   Research in other nuclear areas is also continuing in the 1990s. Nuclear technology plays an important role in medicine, industry, science, and food and agriculture, as well as power generation. For example, doctors use radioisotopes to identify and investigate the causes of disease. They also use them to enhance traditional medical treatments. In industry, radioisotopes are used for measuring microscopic thicknesses, detecting irregularities in metal casings, and testing welds. Archaeologists use nuclear techniques to date prehistoric objects accurately and to locate structural defects in statues and buildings. Nuclear irradiation is used in preserving food. It causes less vitamin loss than canning, freezing, or drying. Nuclear research has benefited mankind in many ways. But today, the nuclear industry faces huge, very complex issues. How can we minimize the risk? What do we do with the waste? The future will depend on advanced engineering, scientific research, and the involvement of an enlightened citizenry.

GX229-30-3433346	"Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology Executive Summary Mission As we become more conscious of the significant energy and environmental challenges facing the United States and the world in this new century, the benefits of nuclear fission as a key energy source for both the near- and long-term future are increasingly apparent. Over the last thirty years, nuclear power has risen to become the second most important source of electric energy in the United States and at the same time, the most economic. The Department of Energy and its predecessor organizations played a large role in this success story. While investing only about $3 billion in today's dollars since the late 1950s and early 1960s--far less than what has been spent on many other energy technologies in just the last decade--the Federal government transferred the technical and scientific expertise created to defend the Nation in the Cold War to the private sector in the form of light water reactor technology. This technology now represents the dominant method of generating energy from nuclear fission in both the United States and the world. A key mission of the Department's nuclear energy research and development program is to help enhance that basic technology and, through some of the most advanced civilian technology research conducted today, chart the way toward the next leap in technology. With these efforts, and those of industry and our overseas partners, nuclear energy will fulfill its promise as a safe, advanced, inexpensive and environmentally benign approach to providing reliable energy to all the world's people.  Departmental Goal Goal 1 - ENERGY SUPPLIES : Through public-private partnerships, DOE's policy and research will provide the technology capable of developing abundant, reliable, affordable, and environmentally-sound energy supplies. This Departmental goal is supported by the Program Strategic Performance Goals that follow: ER7-1: Deploy new nuclear generation to meet energy and climate goals by enabling an industry decision to deploy at least one new advanced nuclear power plant in the U.S. by 2010 to support the President's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent by 2012; completing design of an economic, commercial-scale hydrogen production system using nuclear energy by 2015; and developing a next-generation nuclear system for deployment after 2010 but before 2030 that provides significant improvements in proliferation and terrorism resistance, sustainability, safety and reliability, and economics. ER7-2: Maximize energy from nuclear fuel by enabling a decision by 2010 to forgo the technical need for a second repository while still supporting expanded nuclear power in the U.S. and develop the technology to reduce commercial high-level waste by a factor of four by 2015; and commercializing technology to reduce long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of spent fuel by 2030. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 15   ER7-3 : Protect existing nuclear generation to support the National Energy Policy objectives to maintain and expand the Nation's electricity generation infrastructure by sponsoring innovative, investigator-initiated R&D to enhance the performance of light-water reactor technology to increase generating output from existing plants by at least an additional 500 megawatts by 2020. ER7-4 : Maintain and enhance national nuclear capabilities by producing highly-trained nuclear scientists and engineers to meet the Nation's energy, environmental, health care, and national security needs; preserving critical user facilities and nuclear materials in a safe, secure, environmentally-compliant, and cost-effective manner to support national priorities; replenishing Federal technical and management staff with emphasis on obtaining high-caliber junior professionals with diverse backgrounds; and delivering isotope products and services for commercial, medical, and research applications where there is no private sector capability or sufficient capacity does not exist to meet United States needs such that by December 2004, deliveries continue to be made to customers as needed. Goals and Objectives Deploying New Nuclear Generation to Meet Climate Goals Despite the increased prospects for nuclear power in this country, no new plants have been ordered for decades. There appears to be two key reasons for this: one is economics--with fossil fuels presenting an energy option that is relatively quick and inexpensive to build, and the financial risk associated with nuclear projects, which would be based on new technologies and reliant upon untested regulatory processes. A key example of these risks is the uncertainty of how the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will implement its new ""one-step"" licensing procedure. This process was established to ease the identification of acceptable sites, provide for a combined license for both the construction and operation of new nuclear plants, and provide a clear means to verify the quality of the construction of nuclear power plants. While this new approach represents a major improvement in the way nuclear plants would be licensed, this process has never been put to the test and many questions about its implementation remain. As a result, industry is hesitant to risk billions of dollars until these processes have been shown to work effectively in practice. There is a limited role for the government in addressing these near-term issues. To make a business case for building new plants, industry must continue to refine its designs and plans. Beyond this, there is some interest in technologies and designs not currently available to the U.S. market and the Department is planning activities to bring these technologies to the forefront. The Department plans to provide limited but critical support for companies willing to demonstrate this new regulatory structure. NE program activities will enable the Nation to meet the President's objective of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the next 10 years through the deployment of new nuclear generating capacity.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 16  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The Nuclear Energy Technologies program is working to identify, assess, and develop cost-efficient technologies that further enhance nuclear safety, minimize the generation of nuclear waste, and further reduce the risk of proliferation. In FY 2004, the Nuclear Power 2010 program, a Secretarial initiative, will aggressively pursue demonstration of key regulatory approval processes, foster the completion of cost-effective, advanced nuclear plant designs and develop gas-cooled reactor technologies in order to pave the way for the deployment of new, advanced nuclear plants in the United States by 2010. For the longer-term future, the Department believes that new, next-generation technologies should be considered. This is a key role of the Department of Energy--developing and enabling the deployment of revolutionary energy technologies that--while long-term and high risk in nature--can provide tremendous benefits to the American people. As a prime example, the Department believes that the future energy picture of the United States can and should include a large role for hydrogen. Hydrogen will make it possible for this Nation to realize a primary objective of the National Energy Policy--to enhance the energy independence and security of the United States while making significant improvements in environmental quality. Hydrogen could someday be used to power our entire transportation system, reducing our reliance on imported oil, and dramatically reducing the harmful emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. The technologies to support the use of hydrogen, such as in the Department's FreedomCAR initiative, are making important inroads. However, technologists have long wrestled with how to produce the very large quantities of reliable, economic hydrogen that would be needed to replace petroleum-based fuels in our economy. The Department is working with industry and overseas governments to establish what may prove to be an important answer: nuclear energy-produced hydrogen. Applying advanced thermochemical processes, it may be possible to apply a new generation of nuclear energy plants to produce very large amounts of hydrogen without emitting carbon dioxide or other gases. With its new Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative , the Department will develop new technologies to generate hydrogen on a commercial scale in an economic and environmentally benign manner. The Department's Offices of Nuclear Energy, Fossil Energy, and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy are working in coordination to provide the technological underpinnings of the Administration's FreedomFuel initiative. In the case of nuclear energy, the Department will conduct research and development into advanced thermochemical technologies which may, when used in tandem with next-generation nuclear energy systems, enable the United States to generate hydrogen at a scale and cost (current fossil-fuel-based methods emit greenhouse gases and are roughly four time more costly than the market will support) that would support a future, hydrogen-based economy. Developing the next-generation nuclear systems to make hydrogen possible will be a key aspect of the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative (which is part of the Nuclear Energy Technologies program). Through this effort, the United States will lead multi-national research and development projects to usher forth next-generation nuclear reactors and fuel cycles based on the results of the internationally endorsed Generation IV Technology Roadmap. This international approach allows for the development of technologies that are widely acceptable; enables the Department to access the best expertise in the world to develop complex new technologies; and allows us to leverage our scarce nuclear R&D resources. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 17  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Maximizing Energy from Nuclear Fuel Commercial nuclear power plants currently use only 2-3 percent of the total energy value of their fuel supply. By Maximizing Energy from Nuclear Fuel, the plants and supporting fuel cycle facilities will be designed to use as much of the energy in the fuel as possible. This will be done by developing fuels that can remain in the reactor for longer periods of time and by developing reconditioning technologies that enable used nuclear fuels to be recycled back into the reactors as fresh fuel. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) program will develop technologies which can reduce the volume and long-term toxicity of high level waste from spent nuclear fuel, reduce the long-term proliferation threat posed by civilian inventories of plutonium in spent fuel, and provide for proliferation-resistant technologies to recover the energy content in spent nuclear fuel. Currently, the spent nuclear fuel at nuclear plant sites contains the energy equivalent of 6 billion barrels of oil or about two full years of U.S. oil imports. The AFCI includes two essential elements that will be conducted in parallel as part of an integrated research effort. The first element would be an intermediate-term technology program element--AFCI Series One--which emphasizes advanced technical enhancements to the current commercial nuclear power infrastructure. This area of work will include creating the proliferation-resistant processes and fuels to enable the destruction of significant quantities of commercially generated plutonium in light water reactors or high temperature gas-cooled reactors in operation during the middle of the next decade. Doing so will support the Nation's first repository and reduce and possibly eliminate the technical need for additional repositories AFCI Series Two consists of a phased approach to developing the technologies needed to address the long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel management. Specifically, this effort will develop fuel cycle technologies that could sharply reduce the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of high-level waste sent to a geologic repository, and support development of potential Generation IV fuel cycles. These two program elements are part and parcel of the integrated AFCI effort. Each builds on research and development conducted under the other element and both will be necessary to enable the United States to develop a long-term approach to the nuclear fuel cycle that meets its energy, environment, and nonproliferation policy imperatives. Protecting Existing Nuclear Generation The current United States fleet of 103 commercial nuclear power plants accounts for 20 percent of the Nation's  electricity production and is one of the least expensive options for power production available on the national  grid. As such, Protecting Existing Nuclear Generation is a critical objective in supporting the National  Energy Policy objectives to maintain and expand the Nation's electricity generation infrastructure.  The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) program funds innovative investigator-initiated, peer-reviewed  R&D at U.S. universities, national laboratories, and industry to improve the performance of U.S. light water reactor  technology and develop concepts to solve issues inhibiting the long-term growth of nuclear power.   Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 18  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Maintaining and Enhancing Our National Nuclear Capabilities The Department is the fortunate inheritor of one of the world's most comprehensive research infrastructures--most of which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. The Department is also responsible for providing critical support to our Nation's university nuclear engineering programs and associated research reactor infrastructure. It is imperative that we maintain and enhance our National nuclear capabilities by managing these vital resources and capabilities, efficiently and effectively to ensure that major research/critical facilities will continue to be operational and available for fulfillment of long-term missions. Guided by invaluable input from the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC), we seek efficient ways to preserve our national nuclear assets and make appropriate investments to enhance them before passing them on to future generations. The University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support program supports the operation and upgrade of university research and training reactors, provides graduate fellowships and undergraduate scholarships to outstanding students, uses innovative programs to bring nuclear technology education to small, minority-serving institutions, and provides nuclear engineering research grants to university faculty. The program helps to maintain domestic capabilities to conduct research and the critical infrastructure necessary to attract, educate, and train the next generation of scientists and engineers with expertise in nuclear energy technologies. The Department also partners with industry in a 50/50 cost share program to assist the universities in maintaining their research capabilities. DOE also provides the supply of fresh fuel to and transport of spent fuel from university research reactors and supports reactor equipment upgrades at universities. The Radiological Facilities Management maintains irreplaceable DOE nuclear technology facilities in a safe, secure, environmentally compliant and cost-effective manner to support national priorities. It maintains the Department's vital resources and capabilities at NE-managed facilities at Argonne National Laboratory-West, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory. On July 15, 2002, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham announced a major mission realignment for the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), establishing the laboratory as the Nation's leading center for nuclear energy research and development. The INEEL will become the ""command center"" for the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology's (NE) nuclear energy research and development enterprise, including the lead role in the development of the Department's next-generation nuclear reactor and fuel cycle systems and space nuclear power and propulsion systems. The INEEL will transition its R&D focus from environmental cleanup to nuclear energy technologies while maintaining its multiprogram national laboratory status to best serve ongoing and future national needs. The INEEL will draw upon its strengths in applied engineering, technical integration, production-scale operations, project execution and prototyping as it seeks active R&D partnerships with other DOE national laboratories, universities, and the private sector to develop and deploy nextgeneration nuclear technologies. The Idaho Facilities Management program maintains the INEEL and ANL-W facilities at Idaho in a safe, environmentally compliant and safe condition to support nuclear energy R&D programs, as announced by the Secretary in July 2002. Finally, the Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security program supports activities that are required to protect DOE assets at INEEL and ANL-W from theft, diversion, sabotage, espionage, unauthorized access, compromise, and other hostile acts, which may Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 19   cause unacceptable adverse impacts on national security, program continuity, the health and safety of employees, the public, or the environment. The Program Direction account funds expenses associated with the technical direction and administrative support of NE programs. NE is responsible for leading the Federal government's investment in nuclear science and technology by investing in innovative science and preserving the national research and development infrastructure. As the new LPSO for the INEEL, program direction also funds expenses associated with the infrastructure operations and safeguards and security activities at the Idaho site. NE plans to perform its mission, goals, and activities with excellence in accordance with the President's Management Agenda by implementing a reorganization that will more effectively implement the Secretary's priorities, completing the independent Human Capital and Succession Plan, and continuing to recruit a well-qualified diverse workforce.  Background In considering these objectives, the Nation's National Energy Policy, issued in May 2001, provides excellent guidance. In particular, the Policy makes the following key points about nuclear energy: - ""Nuclear energy accounts for 20 percent of total U.S. electricity generation, and more than 40 percent of the electricity generated in ten states in the Northeast, the South, and the Midwest. Despite the closure of several less efficient plants during the 1990s, the 103 U.S. nuclear energy plants currently operating produce more electricity today than at any time in history."" - ""Since the 1980s, the performance of nuclear energy plant operations has substantially improved. While U.S. nuclear energy plants once generated electricity only around 70 percent of the time, the average plant today is generating electricity close to 90 percent. This improved performance has lowered the cost of nuclear generation, which is now competitive with other sources of electricity."" - ""There is potential for even greater generation from existing nuclear energy plants. Experts estimate that 2,000 MW could be added from existing nuclear power plants by increasing operating performance to 92 percent. In addition, about 12,000 MW of additional nuclear electricity generation could be derived from uprating U.S. nuclear power plants, a process that uses new technologies and methods to increase rated power levels without decreasing safety. However, modifications to uprate plants can be expensive and require extensive licensing review and approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)."" - ""Advanced reactor technology promises to improve nuclear safety. One example of an advanced reactor design is the gas-cooled, pebble-bed reactor, which has inherent safety features."" - ""There is growing interest in new technology known as accelerator transmutation, which could be used in combination with reprocessing to reduce the quantity and toxicity of nuclear waste."" Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 20   Nuclear energy, which is already a vital component of our balanced energy portfolio, presents some of our most promising solutions to the world's long-term energy challenges. Harnessing nuclear energy to generate electricity to drive our twenty-first century economy, to produce vast quantities of economical hydrogen for transportation use without emitting greenhouse gases, to produce heat and clean water to support growing industry and populations all over the world is a potential we ignore at the risk of a sustainable future. At the same time, nuclear energy presents issues that must be addressed--some through excellence in its use, but many others, such as nuclear waste and economics--through advances in technology. Fully realizing nuclear energy's potential requires investment in long-term research to address the factors hindering its worldwide expansion. Much of the research at issue is far beyond the province of private industry; thus, the role of government in establishing a long-term future for nuclear power is clear. Initiatives such as the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative and the Generation IV Nuclear Energy System Initiative serve as an example of an important principle the Department has understood since the days when President Eisenhower tasked the Atomic Energy Commission to lead his Atoms for Peace initiative: U.S. leadership in nuclear technology is a vital component of the Nation's foreign policy. American prominence in nuclear technology enables the United States to exercise considerable influence on the manner in which nuclear technologies are applied worldwide--nuclear materials proliferation practices, nuclear safety, and other areas of policy import are directly advanced by U.S. international technical leadership. In all its activities, the Department obtains advice on the direction of nuclear energy R&D programs from the independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC). NERAC, a formal Federal advisory committee, provides expert advice on long-range plans, priorities, and strategies for the nuclear technology R&D and research infrastructure activities of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE). NERAC has several very active subcommittees examining various aspects of nuclear technology R&D. Reports issued by these subcommittees that address the future of nuclear energy include the Long-Term Nuclear Technology Research and Development Plan, Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap, and A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010. NERAC is also providing expert advice to help guide development of the Generation IV Technology Roadmap, government-industry cooperative research to improve the operation, reliability, and security of the Nation's 103 operating nuclear power plants, and development of new technology approaches to the civilian nuclear fuel cycles. The Long-Term Nuclear Technology Research and Development Plan, developed by NERAC with significant input from the wider research community, recommends that R&D budget levels be increased to enable the Nation to realize further value from our currently operating nuclear plants; provide for economic technologies and approaches to build advanced nuclear power plants in the United States; complete a design for a Generation IV nuclear energy system; and support a range of nuclear energy related missions within the Department. The Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap evaluates the Department's ability to support the most likely R&D needs for the next 20 years. The roadmap is focused on reactors, hot cells and accelerators used to produce isotopes, irradiate materials, and to conduct experiments and examinations required to support our national missions in space exploration, national security, nuclear energy, medical isotopes, and general nuclear science. The roadmap matches the capabilities of each Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 21   facility to one or more R&D requirements. The Roadmap concludes that although we are meeting most of our current needs with existing facilities, the Department must add significant new generation capacity if it is to meet expected infrastructure demands over the next decade. A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010, issued on October 31, 2001, provides a detailed assessment of the technical and institutional actions which must be taken by industry and government to enable the deployment of new, advanced nuclear power plants in the United States by 2010. This near-term deployment roadmap recommends the cost-shared demonstration of the federal regulatory processes for designing, siting, and operating new nuclear power plants. Strategy In accomplishing its program mission, the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology will engage research institutions in industry, U.S. universities, national laboratories, international organizations, and other countries in cooperative and collaborative efforts. NE will leverage its scarce R&D resources through our Generation IV Energy Systems Initiative , Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative and International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative programs. NE will cost-share with industry on research and development activities within the Nuclear Power 2010 program and matching grants within the University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support program. NE will support the President's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 by demonstrating the technical and economic production of hydrogen using nuclear energy through the new Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative . In addition, NE will maintain and improve our facility infrastructure through the Radiological Facilities Management , Idaho Facilities Management , and Idaho Sitewide Safeguard and Security programs. Finally, NE will preserve and improve our human capital infrastructure to perform its mission, goals, and activities with excellence in accordance with the President's Management Agenda through the Program Direction activities. Specific program accomplishments that will enable NE to achieve its mission are identified in the detailed program budget submissions. As a means of measuring the effectiveness of these Nuclear Energy Research and Development programs, OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used to evaluate the research results achieved thus far. The programs evaluated received very high scores for the purpose, planning and management sections of PART. Lower scores for the results and accountability section of PART were received due to the fact that NE's R&D programs are in early stages of development. NE has committed to implementing a number of actions to help measure the effectiveness of its programs.

This program will address the need for greater utilization of our energy resources by investigating the uses for nuclear power on an integrated basis as both a heat source, an electricity source, and a source of clean hydrogen which can supplant fossil fuels in our transportation system. Hydrogen produced by nuclear energy can be developed into a practical source of energy that will reduce the environmental impacts of meeting growing hydrogen fuel demand. This activity will study Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 23  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   potential nuclear energy configurations, conduct research and development on enabling technologies, demonstrate nuclear-based hydrogen producing technologies, and evaluate deployment scenarios to meet future needs for increased hydrogen consumption. In July 2002, the Secretary of Energy announced a major mission realignment for the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), establishing the site as the Nation's leading center of nuclear research and development. As a result, oversight of the INEEL transferred from Office of Environmental Management (EM) to NE. INEEL will become the ""command center"" for NE's strategic nuclear energy research and development enterprise, INEEL's revised mission will play a major role in Generation IV's nuclear energy systems development, advanced fuel cycle development, and space nuclear power and propulsion applications. The INEEL will transition its research and development focus from environmental programs to nuclear energy programs while maintaining its multi-program national laboratory status to best serve ongoing and future DOE and national needs. While INEEL will focus on its new role as the center for nuclear research and development as a multi-program national laboratory, the INEEL will continue to pursue appropriate roles in national security, environmental and other activities. In addition to the transfer of INEEL, the Department is proposing a new structure for NE's FY 2004 budget. The new Idaho Facilities Management program includes the Argonne National Laboratory West (ANL-W) Operations program, previously funded under Radiological Facilities Management and a new account, INEEL Infrastructure. The INEEL Infrastructure program incorporates the Idaho Landlord program, previously funded under EM, and the Test Reactor Area Landlord program, previously funded in NE's Radiological Facilities Management program, into one program. Also, beginning in FY 2004, the safeguards and security programs at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and the Argonne National Laboratory-West will be integrated into a single program: Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security. These changes more accurately reflect the activities being performed at the Idaho sites and facilities. Other proposed structure changes in FY 2004 include incorporating the facilities and infrastructure activities previously funded in the Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems and Medical Isotope programs, into the Radiological Facilities Management. In addition, the titles of these programs have been changed to Space and Defense Infrastructure and the Medical Isotope Infrastructure. These changes more accurately reflect the activities being performed at NE managed sites and facilities.  Major Issues NE's mission is to promote the responsible use of nuclear technology by investing in innovative science and preserving the national research and development infrastructure. NE sponsors nuclear energy technology research by the national laboratories, by U.S. universities, and by industry and cooperates with a wide range of international partners. NE manages the safe operation and maintenance of critical nuclear infrastructure and provides nuclear technology goods and services to industry and to other government organizations. NE's technology research programs also secure our long-term national security interests by developing advanced technologies that advance our non-proliferation goals. This is a highly technical mission that requires staff with expertise in a broad range of highly specialized engineering (nuclear, materials, electrical, chemical, etc.) and scientific (physics, health physics, metallurgy, chemistry, etc.) disciplines. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 24  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   NE is one of the most programmatically diverse organizations in the Department and is faced with critical human capital challenges to pursue its mission and programs. Several years ago, NE went through extensive downsizing that resulted in numerous skill imbalances. Wherever possible, employees will be redeployed from lower priority programs to higher priority programs to meet mission needs. However, the organization has reached a point, with expanding programs, limited resources, and skill imbalances, that it is struggling to meet the requirements set for it by the President and the Secretary of Energy. NE currently has a staff of about 132 personnel and nearly half of those will be eligible to retire within five years. NE has plans to aggressively address the mismatch between the growth in its national responsibilities and the decline in its skilled personnel. NE's recent reorganization, in conjunction with the Human Capital and Succession Plan, will enable NE to perform its mission, goals, and activities with excellence in accordance with the President's Management Agenda. These proposed actions and NE's broadening mission create additional requirements for Program Direction funds. In addition to its staff, the Department's nuclear research infrastructure is aging. The Department is the fortunate inheritor of one of the world's most comprehensive research infrastructures--most of which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. It is imperative that it is effectively maintained. NE has made it one it its most important priorities to make the investments and expend the management attention necessary to preserve our irreplaceable nuclear research infrastructure. Guided by invaluable input such as the NERAC Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap, we will seek efficient ways to preserve our infrastructure and make appropriate investments to enhance it before passing it on to future generations.  __________________________________________ William D. Magwood, IV Director, Office of Nuclear Energy, Science  and Technology  _________________  Date   Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Executive Summary  Page 25  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Page 26   University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support Program Mission The United States has led the world in the development and application of nuclear technology for many decades. This leadership, which spans national security, energy, environmental, medical and other applications, has been possible only because the United States Government fostered advanced nuclear technology education at many universities and colleges across the Nation. Government's role has not diminished over the years and is in fact now essential to the preservation of these programs to maintain the education and training infrastructure necessary to develop the next generation of nuclear scientists and engineers. The University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support program offers essential support to U.S. university nuclear engineering programs and university research reactors. While the number of nuclear engineering programs and research reactors in the United States declined precipitously during the 1980s and 1990s, the Nation's need for nuclear engineers and nuclear trained personnel is now on the rise due to the lack of large numbers of recent nuclear engineering graduates and the increasing number of retirements in the nuclear field. Demand for nuclear engineers now exceeds supply. This program supports the National Energy Policy objective to expand nuclear energy in the United States by preserving the education and training infrastructure at universities that will be needed as the United States continues its reliance on advanced nuclear technologies into the future. This program is essential to the continued operation of the Nation's university research and training reactors which play a vital role in supporting nuclear education and training. The independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) established a Blue Ribbon Panel to consider the future of the U.S. nuclear education infrastructure, with particular focus on the future of the U.S. university research reactors and the relationship between universities and the national laboratories in the conduct of nuclear engineering research. In May 2000, the panel, with representatives from universities, national laboratories and government, presented its final report to NERAC. The Blue Ribbon Panel report, The Future Direction of University Nuclear Engineering Programs , recognized that the ability to advance nuclear innovation in the future is not only tied to research but to the health of the Nation's education and scientific research infrastructure in general and its university research reactors in particular. In addition, the Blue Ribbon Panel recommended several initiatives to strengthen nuclear engineering education including increasing the number of doctoral and masters students receiving financial assistance; assisting universities in recruiting and training faculty through junior faculty research grants; expanding research in nuclear science and; better supporting our university research reactors through grants for instrumentation and equipment upgrades; and establishing a new competitive program for more costly equipment upgrades. Several studies have been completed in an attempt to ascertain the current status and future outlook for nuclear engineering education in the U.S. and recommend initiatives to strengthen this vital sector of the university education curriculum. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency conducted a review of nuclear engineering education in its member countries and the Nuclear Energy Department Heads Organization surveyed U.S. industry and universities concerning manpower requirements (www.engin.umich.edu/~nuclear/NEDHO/). Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 27   The conclusion of these two studies was that the enrollment trends of the 1990s were not encouraging and more students need to be educated in nuclear engineering to provide the trained nuclear scientists and engineers the Nation will require in the future. A third study by an expert panel appointed by NERAC recommended major increases in funding to maintain the nuclear engineering infrastructure in the United States (www.nuclear.gov). This three-person panel of experts from NERAC collected and assessed information on all university reactors including their research and training capabilities and operating costs. In their April 2001 report, NERAC recommended that the Department provide increased financial support to keep essential reactor facilities in operation. The Department is implementing this recommendation beginning in FY 2002 through the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education (INIE) program. INIE encourages participating universities to form ground breaking partnerships with national laboratories, the private sector and other universities to strengthen nuclear engineering education in the United States. In FY 2002, four INIE grants, involving 14 universities with reactors and/or nuclear engineering programs, were awarded. Over the last several years our initiatives in support of students, faculty and facilities have yielded positive results. Undergraduate enrollments in nuclear engineering, which had suffered steady declines for two decades, have increased dramatically at many schools due to the availability of more student scholarships, research funding, faculty support and funding support by the private sector resulting from our Matching Grant program. Minority participation and support has also risen sharply with our program pairing nuclear engineering schools with minority institutions enabling students from a minority university to achieve degrees in both nuclear engineering and their chosen technical field.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support  Page 28  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Program Strategic Performance Goal ER7-4:  Maintain and enhance national nuclear capabilities by producing highly-trained nuclear scientists and engineers to meet the Nation's energy, environmental, health care, and national security needs; preserving critical user facilities in a safe, secure, environmentally-compliant, and cost-effective manner to support national priorities; replenishing Federal technical and management staff with emphasis on obtaining high-caliber junior professionals with diverse backgrounds; and delivering isotope products and services for commercial, medical, and research applications where there is no private sector capability or sufficient capacity does not exist to meet United States needs such that by December 2004, deliveries continue to be made to customers as needed. Performance Indicator: Progress will be measured by: - Annual increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollments in nuclear engineering and science.

The International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) is conducted by ANL for the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology. This program provides for student exchanges between the United States and several other nations enabling nuclear engineering and science students the opportunity to work in another nation's national laboratories and increase their training opportunities. ANL also administers part of the university program summer internship program. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support  Page 31  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is an extensive research and engineering complex that has been at the center of some of the most advanced energy research in the world since 1949. In recent years, in addition to continued operation of complex nuclear and nonnuclear facilities, the INEEL has initiated technology development in applied environmental science and engineering. In July 1999, the Department selected INEEL and ANL Lead Laboratories. These Lead Laboratories assist and Energy, Science and Technology to maintain and apply the Department is maximizing its investment in nuclear to serve as the Nuclear Reactor Technology work with the Department's Office of Nuclear world class technical capabilities to assure that reactor technology research and development.  INEEL administers the University Reactor Fuel Assistance Program to provide fuel for university research reactors including fuel for conversions from high enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU), and to ship spent fuel from university reactors to DOE's Savannah River Site. INEEL also administers the peer-review of the Nuclear Engineering Education Research (NEER) program that provides competitive investigator-initiated, research grants to U.S. nuclear engineering schools; the university reactor upgrade program that provides funding for improvements and maintenance of the 28 university research reactors; and part of the university programs summer interns hip program. Oak Ridge National Laboratory The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a U.S. Department of Energy scientific research laboratory located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORNL administers part of the university programs summer internship program. ORNL also maintains the DOE computer code system, software, and documentation at the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center (RSICC) and serves as a repository for DOE computational research activities, including computer software that is developed by NERI and NEER research projects. The RSICC computer software is made available to nuclear engineering departments and NERI and NEER awardees. All Other Sites This description includes the activities funded at the various operations offices. Included in the category is funding for the matching grants program that provides government/private sector matching funds for the nuclear engineering infrastructure at universities; reactor sharing that assists universities with reactors in sharing them with other universities, high schools, and others for training and experiments; nuclear engineering fellowships and scholarships for outstanding graduate and undergraduate students and minority/majority partnership scholarships, all of which are awarded through a peer-reviewed, competitive process. The peer review committees are composed of nuclear engineering professors representing a broad spectrum of nuclear engineering programs throughout the United States. These programs are administered by the South Carolina University Research and Education Foundation. The Idaho Operations Office (ID) administers the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education program, which establishes regional research and training centers to further strengthen the university Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support Page 32  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   research infrastructure. ID also administers the NEER program that provides research grants to nuclear engineering schools and the university reactor upgrade program for reactor improvement and maintenance. The nuclear engineer training effort which supports nuclear engineering education recruitment activities in conjunction with a professional society is also administered by ID. The Savannah River Operations Office administers the radiochemistry program for faculty support and student fellowships to help educate a new generation of radiochemists to address the technical challenges associated with radioactive wastes and contaminated sites.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support  Page 33  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Page 34   University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives University nuclear engineering programs supply highly skilled nuclear scientists and engineers to industry in fields such as electricity generation, medicine, environmental restoration, and national security, as well as to government agencies and national laboratories. To help ensure the continued viability of these programs, the Department provides assistance to university nuclear science and engineering and related programs. Assistance includes the DOE/Industry Matching Grants program, which leverages public sector funds with private contributions in a 50/50 cost share arrangement; the Nuclear Engineering Education Research program, which provides vital research funding to university nuclear technology programs; academic assistance to outstanding students and faculty through the Scholarships and Fellowships program with an added dimension supporting students at minority institutions in achieving nuclear engineering degrees at universities with a nuclear engineering department; and support of university research reactors. University research reactors in the United States form a fundamental and key component of the national research and education infrastructure. Research conducted using these reactors is critical to many national priorities such as health care, materials science, and energy technology. Currently, there are 28 operating university research reactors at 27 campuses in 21 states. University reactors are the source of neutrons for research in such diverse areas as medical isotopes, human health, life sciences, environmental protection, advanced materials, lasers, energy conversion, and food irradiation. University research reactors directly support the development of highly qualified, technically knowledgeable personnel needed by national laboratories, private industry, the Federal government and academia, and needed for conducting basic and applied research critical to U.S. technological competitiveness. In addition, with the help of the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education and Reactor Sharing programs, many of the reactors serve as centers for education programs offered to other colleges and universities and high school students and teachers who visit the reactor for instructional programs and research. The University Reactor Fuel Assistance and Support program funds the supply of fresh fuel to and return of spent fuel from university research reactors allowing universities to continue their important research and education activities. The Reactor Upgrade program provides funding for equipment instrumentation upgrades at the universities' research reactors, increasing their value as research tools, while the radiochemistry program supports students and faculty in the discipline of radiochemical science, which supports the nuclear energy infrastructure of the Nation. The Nuclear Engineering Education Support program prepares students for nuclear engineering and science careers and assists universities with special needs to improve their educational infrastructure including internships for students at DOE national laboratories. This program was initiated to address the knowledge gap of incoming college freshmen in the area of nuclear science and engineering. The Nuclear Engineering Education Research (NEER) program funds innovative research at university reactors permitting both faculty and students to benefit from hands-on research. The Matching Grant program permits universities to strengthen their nuclear engineering course of study in a way that best fits each institution and the private sector match in this program leverages DOE funding. The key component to nuclear engineering infrastructure continues to be the quality of students produced by the universities. DOE's fellowships and scholarship programs not only help assure that sufficient students are attracted to nuclear engineering but that the best and brightest students pursue this discipline.

University Nuclear Infrastructure (UNI) .............................. 17,500 9,815 FY 03 17,500 9,815 FY 04 18,500 10,815  The UNI program provides new fuel for the universities; instrumentation, electronics, hardware, and software upgrades for the research reactors; and reactor sharing and research cooperation among educational institutions to facilitate the development of the Nation's next generation of nuclear scientists and engineers. A continued emphasis on research infrastructure support is needed to continue the successes made to date in the Nation's university nuclear engineering programs. The UNI program will continue to supply fresh fuel to and ship spent fuel from university reactors requiring these services in FY 2004. In FY 2004, the program will provide fuel elements for the reactors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Kansas State University, and the Universities of Missouri, Michigan, California, and Utah. In FY 2004, the program will continue to provide grants permitting universities without research reactors to have access to university reactors for training, education, and research purposes. In FY 2002, 22 grants were made. In FY 2003 and FY 2004 the number of reactor sharing grants is expected to remain relatively constant. The UNI program will also continue to assist in addressing the maintenance and upgrade of equipment required at university research reactors, providing for replacement of outdated equipment, maintenance of reactor systems, and upgrading of experimental capabilities at 23 university reactors in FY 2002 and about 18 reactors in FY 2003 and FY 2004. The funding in FY 2004 will support the Innovations in Nuclear Infrastructure and Education (INIE) initiative to assist the universities in continuing the integration of academics and reactor research, enhancing the quality of student education, and encouraging universities to better work with the Department's national laboratories, private industry and other universities in expanding the use of their facilities for research, education, and training of nuclear engineers and scientists through the establishment of regional research and training centers and strategic partnerships. INIE began in FY 2002 with awards to four partnerships in geographically diverse areas of the United States. These four awards are providing support for 14 universities with nuclear engineering programs and/or nuclear research and training reactors. The awards are for one year, renewable annually, for up to five years. The increase of $1,000,000 is due to funding an additional university consortium.  DOE/Industry Matching Grants Program .......................... 800 800 800 In FY 2004, the DOE/Industry Matching Grants program which supports education, training, and innovative research at participating U.S. universities will continue. This program provided grants of up to $60,000, which are matched by industry. In FY 2002, 21 universities received awards and an expected 20-25 will receive awards in FY 2003 and FY 2004.

Fellowships will be provided to M.S. and PhD. students and scholarships to undergraduate students. The fellowship and scholarship program has had many more qualified applicants than could be funded, discouraging some students from continuing in the field of nuclear engineering. In FY 2002, stipends for these fellowships were increased to keep them competitive with non-nuclear engineering fellowships. A total of 23 fellowships and more than 50 scholarships were awarded in FY 2002 with 18 fellowships and 40 scholarships expected in FY 2003 and FY 2004. The University Partnership program was initiated in FY 2000 to encourage students enrolled in minority serving institutions to pursue a nuclear engineering degree in cooperation with universities that grant those degrees. In FY 2002, the Department funded four university partnerships and expects to fund five in FY 2003 and FY 2004.  Nuclear Engineering Education Research (NEER) Grants 5,000 5,000 5,000  In FY 2002, existing and new NEER grants totaled approximately 50; the same number of grants is planned for FY 2003 and FY 2004.  Nuclear Engineering Education Opportunities.................... 385 385 385  The Nuclear Engineering Education Opportunities program began in FY 2000 to support nuclear engineering education recruitment activities to ensure a highly informed group of students are available to enter university nuclear engineering and related scientific courses of study. The funding enables teacher workshops in nuclear science and engineering to be conducted at high schools and middle schools across the United States; the production and distribution of educational materials; and permits universities to address equipment, faculty, and material needs for their nuclear engineering curriculum that do not fall within the scope of other university program activities. The teacher workshops program is conducted in conjunction with the American Nuclear Society (ANS) which provides the training. ANS uses qualified volunteers from its membership to train teachers and students, keeping costs down. Since this program began in FY 2000, more than 100 workshops have been held throughout the country. The workshops planned for FY 2004 will reach thousands of teachers enabling them to explain nuclear science and engineering principles to their students.

The mission of the Research and Development program is to continue to expand the benefits of nuclear science and technology by investing in innovative research. Nuclear energy presents some of our most promising solutions to the world's long-term energy challenges. Harnessing nuclear energy to generate electricity to drive our twenty-first century economy, to produce vast quantities of economical hydrogen for transportation use without emitting greenhouse gases, to produce heat and clean water to support growing industry and populations all over the world is a potential we ignore at the risk of a sustainable future. At the same time, nuclear energy presents issues that must be addressed--some through excellence in its use, but many others such as nuclear waste and economics- through advances in technology. Fully realizing nuclear energy's potential requires investment in longterm research to address the issues hindering its worldwide expansion. Much of the research at issue is far beyond the province of private industry; thus, the role of government in establishing a long-term future for nuclear power is clear. The Department obtains advice on the direction of nuclear energy R&D programs from the independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC). NERAC, a formal Federal advisory committee, provides expert advice on long-range plans, priorities, and strategies for the nuclear technology R&D and research infrastructure activities of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE). NERAC has several very active subcommittees examining various aspects of nuclear technology R&D. Reports issued by these subcommittees that address the future of nuclear energy include the Long-Term Nuclear Technology Research and Development Plan, the Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap, and A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010. NERAC is also providing expert advice to help guide development of the Generation IV Technology Roadmap, government-industry cooperative research to improve the operation, reliability, and security of the Nation's 103 operating nuclear power plants, and development of new technology approaches to the civilian nuclear fuel cycles. The Long-Term Nuclear Technology Research and Development Plan, developed by NERAC with significant input from the wider research community, recommends that R&D budget levels be increased to enable the Nation to realize further value from our currently operating nuclear plants; provide for economic technologies and approaches to build advanced nuclear power plants in the United States; complete a design for a Generation IV nuclear energy system; and support a range of nuclear energy related missions within the Department. The Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap evaluates the Department's ability to support the most likely R&D needs for the next 20 years. The roadmap is focused on reactors, hot cells and accelerators used to produce isotopes, irradiate materials, and to conduct experiments and examinations required to support our national missions in space exploration, national security, nuclear energy, medical isotopes, and general nuclear science. The roadmap matches the capabilities of each facility to one or more R&D requirements. The Roadmap concludes that although we are meeting most Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 41   of our current needs with existing facilities, the Department must add significant new generation capacity if it is to meet expected infrastructure demands over the next decade. A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010, issued on October 31, 2001, provides a detailed assessment of the technical and institutional actions which must be taken by industry and government to enable the deployment of new, advanced nuclear power plants in the United States by 2010. This near-term deployment roadmap recommends the cost-shared demonstration of the federal regulatory processes for designing, siting, and operating new nuclear power plants. Our technology research programs also secure our long-term national security interests by developing advanced technologies that advance our non-proliferation goals. For example, programs such as Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems and Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative are at the heart of the Department's response to the initiatives announced by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation to consider ways the nations could work together to improve the proliferation-resistance of civilian nuclear energy systems. Our Nation's investments in nuclear energy R&D are made to improve the quality of life, energy security, and economic prospects for the American people. Currently, 20 percent of our Nation's electricity is produced with emission-free nuclear power plants. The National Energy Policy calls for the expansion of nuclear energy in the United States. In support of this goal, the Department's nuclear energy R&D programs address three critical objectives: Protecting Existing Nuclear Generation The current United States fleet of 103 commercial nuclear power plants accounts for 20 percent of the Nation's electricity production and is one of the least expensive options for power production available on the national grid. Current nuclear power plants are expected to operate for at least 60 years--well into the middle of the century. Electricity demand in the United States is expected to grow sharply in the 21st century, requiring significant additions of new generation capacity. Forecasts indicate that the United States will need about 428,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by 2025, even if ambitious assumptions are made regarding energy efficiency practices and technologies. The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) program funds new innovative investigator-initiated, peer-reviewed R&D at U.S. universities, national laboratories, and industry to advance nuclear energy technology. The research conducted under NERI program brings innovative, investigator-initiated research to support continued operation of existing nuclear power plants for at least 60 years in addition to innovative research activities needed for next generation plants. To address these issues, NERI is currently sponsoring R&D in areas including novel next generation, proliferation-resistant reactor designs, advanced nuclear fuel development, and fundamental nuclear science that can:     improve provide advance develop reactor materials for existing and future plants,  advanced methods of monitoring long-term material performance,  state-of-the-art plant instrumentation, control and monitoring technologies, and  safer, higher performing nuclear fuels.   Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development  FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 42   NERI has helped return the United States to a key leadership role in the international exploration of nuclear technology, prompting the interest and support of many other nations and leading to expanded research and development collaboration. The Department initiated an International NERI (I-NERI) effort in FY 2001 with bilateral cost-shared research collaborations with other nations, I-NERI is focused on scientific research and advanced technology development to improve the cost and enhance the safety, proliferation resistance, and waste management of advanced nuclear energy systems. The NEPO program has made significant progress toward addressing many of the material aging and generation optimization issues which have been identified as the key long-term issues facing current operating plants. Recent results from the NEPO program include: a determination of the optimum amount of the zinc which should be added to a typical pressurized water reactor to reduce the possibility of cracks developing in some of the significant components of the reactor; the development of new electrical cable monitoring techniques for improved prediction of cable lifetimes; the development of techniques to qualify smart transmitters to replace existing analog transmitters which are less accurate and difficult to maintain; the development of an industry consensus approach for implementing digital upgrades to existing nuclear power plant safety systems; and the determination of the optimum fuel burnup and operating cycle length for both pressurized and boiling water reactors. Further highlights of the NEPO program are contained in the Joint DOE-EPRI Strategic Research and Development Plan to Optimize U.S. Nuclear Power Plants HIGHTLIGHTS, dated June 14, 2001 (see http://nepo.ne.doe.gov). While the Department continues to support the objectives of the NEPO program, no funding is requested for NEPO in FY 2004. Deploying New Nuclear Generation to Meet Energy and Climate Goals U.S. electricity demand continues to grow at approximately two percent per year. While historically modest, this growth, which powers the United States economy, would require the United States to build between 1,400 and 2,100 new power plants by 2025. This equates to building and commissioning 60 to 90 power plants each year over the next 25 years. To meet this need, the National Energy Policy recommends the expansion of nuclear energy in the United States, including the construction of new nuclear plants. The Nuclear Power 2010 program is focused on resolving the technical, institutional, and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants by 2010, consistent with the recommendations of the NERAC report, A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010. In order to support the National Energy Policy and the President's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent by 2012, the Nuclear Power 2010 program will achieve:  completion of the NRC staff review and issuance of the Final Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for an advanced reactor Design Certification application,  NRC approval of Early Site Permit applications and Combined Construction and operating License applications by 2008, and  an industry decision to deploy at least one new advanced nuclear power plant by the end of the decade.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development  FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 43   The Nuclear Power 2010 program will pave the way for near-term deployment of new power plants in the United States through cost-shared demonstration of the new, untested regulatory processes and costshared development of advanced nuclear power plant technologies. The regulatory demonstration tasks include the Early Site Permit (ESP) and combined Construction and Operating License (COL) regulatory processes to reduce licensing uncertainties and the attendant financial risks to the licensee. The technology development activities support research and development to finalize and certify those advanced nuclear power plant designs which U.S. power generation companies are willing to build. The Nuclear Power 2010 program incorporates competitive procurement processes for the regulatory demonstration and technology development activities and requires a minimum of 50 percent industry cost share for most program activities. Through the competitive procurement process, it is expected that innovative business arrangements will be formed between power generating companies and reactor vendors with strong and common incentives to successfully build and operate new plants in the United States. While contributing 17 percent of electricity generation worldwide, nuclear energy currently contributes only seven percent to the overall global energy requirements. Considering emerging issues such as sustainable development of world economies, the capacity of nuclear energy to deliver energy that is free from greenhouse gas emissions or other air pollutants offers a renewed incentive to consider a broadened, energy-intensive product mix. Nuclear technology, combined with advanced thermochemical technologies, presents a very promising approach to produce hydrogen in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. A large market for hydrogen already exists in the fertilizer and oil industries. Hydrogen and other synthetic chemical fuels are expected to find broadening application on world energy markets; the transportation sector has already begun a transition to hydrogen enrichment of fuels. The Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative mission is focused on the development and demonstration of a commercially viable, reactor-driven process for the large-scale production of hydrogen. To address these issues, the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative will:   demonstrate the economic deployment of thermo-chemical water splitting techniques for hydrogen production by 2006, and achieve operation of a commercial-scale hydrogen production system prototype by 2008. worldwide about sustainable development, the Department started the Systems Initiative. Generation IV advanced reactor and fuel cycle an important role in meeting electric and other non-electricity needs, and process heat. Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative will  Recognizing growing concerns Generation IV Nuclear Energy technologies are poised to play such as hydrogen, clean water, meet these needs by:     developing advanced reactor and fuel cycle systems characterized by improved safety and reliability, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance and physical protection, for commercial deployment after 2010 but before 2030. developing advanced reactor and fuel cycle systems that can be used to produce electricity, hydrogen, and clean water economically and without emitting harmful pollutants to the environment, after 2010 but before 2030.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development  FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 44   The Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative includes strong international participation. In January 2000, the Department initiated the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) by convening a meeting of senior government officials from nine countries with long-term interest in the application of nuclear energy. In July 2001, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States signed a formal, governmentsanctioned charter to identify and develop Generation IV technologies on a multilateral basis, to address the expansion of nuclear energy internationally. Switzerland has since joined this group of countries. Although the Generation IV Technology Roadmap to guide Generation IV R&D will not be issued until early 2003, the GIF made a final selection of the six most promising nuclear reactor and fuel cycle concepts at its May 2002 meeting. The Department will select the systems of greatest interest to the U.S. and initiate the research and development identified in the Roadmap in cost-shared cooperation with other GIF member countries. Maximizing Energy from Nuclear Fuel As the United States considers the expansion of nuclear energy (as recommended in the National Energy Policy), it is clear that the Nation must optimize its approach to managing spent nuclear fuel. While the planned geologic repository at Yucca Mountain is sufficient for all commercial spent fuel generated in the United States through 2015, the current ""once-through"" approach to spent fuel will require the United States to build additional repository space to assure the continued, safe management of nuclear waste from currently-operating plants and a new generation of nuclear plants. Further, long-term issues associated with the toxicity of nuclear waste and the eventual proliferation risks posed by plutonium in spent fuel remain. To address these issues, the Department has embarked, with its international partners, on a new research effort with both an intermediate-term (2015) and a long-term (2030) component. This program, the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, aims to develop advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies that can:       enhance the design and reduce the long-term cost of the Nation's first geologic repository,  recover the energy value of commercial spent nuclear fuel,  reduce or eliminate the technical need for an additional repository,  reduce by a factor of four the quantity of high-level waste requiring disposition in a repository,  permanently destroy the plutonium that is contained within spent nuclear fuel, and  reduce by a factor of 1,000 the radiotoxicity hazard posed by spent nuclear fuel   If successful, the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative will enable the United States to fully optimize its geologic repository  increasing its performance and reducing its costs  and do so in a proliferationresistant manner. This research is also central to the agreement between President Bush and President Putin of the Russian Federation to explore potential cooperation in advanced proliferation-resistant fuel cycles.

Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 49   Nuclear Energy Technologies Nuclear Power 2010  In FY 2002, completed the near-term deployment roadmap, A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010, recommending actions to be taken by government and industry to successfully address regulatory and institutional issues and enable one or more orders for new commercial nuclear power plants in the United States by 2005 for deployment by 2010.  In FY 2002, the Secretary announced the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative aimed at building new nuclear power plants in the United States by 2010.  In FY 2002, completed competitively selected cost-shared Early Site Permit (ESP) scoping studies by power generating companies to evaluate site suitability and to develop schedule and resource estimates for siting new nuclear power plants at both federal and commercial sites.  In FY 2002, completed a Nuclear Business Case Study, developed with expert input from U.S. financial and nuclear industries, to identify the necessary conditions under which utilities would add new nuclear capacity, and to develop strategies to close the financial gaps which pose the highest risk.  In FY 2002, continued cooperation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the development of a gas reactor regulatory and licensing framework, including conduct of an evaluation of the gas-cooled reactor technologies and identification of technical issues and research required for licensing.  In FY 2002, initiated cost-shared regulatory demonstration projects with industry to jointly proceed with NRC Early Site Permit (ESP) applications for specific commercial sites.  In FY 2002, finalized the planning of the gas-cooled reactor fuel irradiation, test, and qualification program.  In FY 2003, initiate cost-shared advanced nuclear power plant technology development, selection, and licensing activities. The Early Site Permit applications will be submitted to the NRC.

In FY 2004, cost-shared regulatory demonstration projects for ESP and the advanced nuclear power plant technology development project will continue.  In FY 2004, finalize selection and award a utility cost-shared project to demonstrate the COL process. Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems  In FY 2001, established the Generation IV technology goals and initiated development of the Generation IV Technology Roadmap.  In FY 2001, established the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) with Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Republic of South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States to jointly develop the Generation IV Technology Roadmap and to establish cooperative partnerships for Generation IV research and development.   In FY 2002, Switzerland joined the GIF.   In FY 2002, selected the six most promising nuclear energy concepts with full GIF endorsement.  In FY 2002, completed the final draft of the Roadmap in accordance with the original Roadmap objectives.   In FY 2003, submit the Generation IV Technology Roadmap to Congress.

Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 51    In FY 2003, the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) was selected by the Department as the system of greatest interest, because of its capability to produce hydrogen efficiently and its relatively small technology gaps. Three reactor concepts with fast-neutron spectrum were also selected for viability R&D. Development of these systems, after the development of advanced fuel cycle systems in the Department's Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative program, would lead to a highly proliferation-resistant, cost-effective nuclear fuel cycle that could continue to supply energy to the U.S. for hundreds of years to come.  In FY 2004, complete screening of concept-specific fuel options and selection of reference and backup fuel forms; initiate preparation of fuel samples to support property measurements and smallscale irradiation tests in FY 2005 and beyond.  In FY 2004, perform reactor and balance-of-plant concept development studies and initiate conceptual design and trade studies for a new gas-cooled test and research reactor. Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative  In FY 2004, the program will be initiated; a research and technology development roadmap will be completed and research and development will be initiated to establish the technical basis for, and demonstrating the viability of a commercial-scale hydrogen production capability using nuclear energy. Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative  In FY 2001, the Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) program was formally established within the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology consistent with congressional direction and funding for FY 2001.  In FY 2001, established a science and engineering based research program for transmutation technologies and initiated systems studies to evaluate technology options.  In FY 2001, the AAA university fellowship program was established. Ten fellowships were awarded for the pursuit of master's degrees in areas of interest to the AAA program. (In FY 2004, this program is continuing.)  In FY 2002, demonstrated the separation of uranium from highly radioactive fission products in commercial spent nuclear fuel with the uranium cleaned up to 99.999 per cent pure (Class C waste), using the newly developed UREX process.  In FY 2002, transferred the Russian Lead-bismuth Spallation Target to the University of Nevada at Las Vegas for experiment studies.

Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Research and Development  FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 62   Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization (NEPO) program was developed as part of a comprehensive approach to assure that the United States has the technological capability to assure adequate supplies of baseload electricity while minimizing harmful impacts on the environment. The President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) Panel on Federal Energy Research and Development identified the critical role of nuclear power in its November 1997 report. The Panel's report recommended that the Department work with its laboratories and industry to develop a cost-shared program to address the technical issues that may prevent the continued operation of existing nuclear power plants. The NEPO program supports the National Energy Policy objectives regarding the use of nuclear energy in the United States by conducting research to ensure that current nuclear plants can continue to deliver reliable, safe, and affordable electricity up to and beyond their initial 40-year license period. The NEPO program supports the Secretary of Energy's priorities to ensure U.S. energy security by protecting critical infrastructure that supports the production and delivery of energy in America and focusing on programs that help America increase its supply of energy by increased domestic production. The Department established the NEPO program in FY 2000 as a cost-shared program with industry. The R&D projects initiated in FY 2000 and FY 2001, and those being initiated in FY 2002 address plant aging and development and application of new technologies to improve plant reliability, availability, and productivity while maintaining a high level of safety. The Department and the electric utility industry's Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) developed the Joint DOE-EPRI Strategic Research and Development Plan to Optimize U.S. Nuclear Power Plants to help the Federal Government and private sector jointly identify, prioritize, and execute R&D. The plan, first issued in March 1998 and later updated in October 2000, is based upon input from utilities, DOE national laboratories, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other key stakeholders. Research funded under the NEPO program is based upon this joint strategic plan. Approximately sixty percent of the total funding for R&D conducted under the NEPO program is provided by industry. No NEPO projects are designed to support utility efforts to obtain NRC operating license renewals. The Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) Subcommittee on Operating Nuclear Power Plants Research and Development provides the Department independent, expert advice on the execution of the NEPO program. A Coordinating Committee, with representatives from NRC, industry, national laboratories, and universities, working directly with the NERAC operating plant subcommittee, provides the Department with recommendations on prioritization of the R&D projects. NEPO R&D projects are awarded on a competitive basis, unless there is a unique capability that justifies the work being performed at a specific location or by a specific contractor. Non-competitive awards are made only when the R&D requires a unique facility which already exists and it is not prudent to incur the cost of building a duplicate facility elsewhere, or the selected recipient has a unique knowledge of and experience with the specific data associated with the R&D being conducted and a significant delay will occur if the R&D is conducted elsewhere. NEPO projects are performed at U.S. national laboratories, commercial contractors, and universities. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Page 63  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The NEPO program has made significant progress toward addressing many of the material aging and generation optimization issues which have been identified as the key long-term issues facing current operating plants. Examples of recent results from the NEPO program include the development of new electrical cable monitoring techniques for improved prediction of cable lifetimes; and the development of techniques to qualify smart transmitters to replace existing analog transmitters which are less accurate and difficult to maintain. Further information about current projects and recent results of the NEPO program are contained in the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program 2001 Annual Report issued in February 2002 (see http://nepo.ne.doe.gov). While the Department continues to support the objectives of the NEPO program, no funding is requested for this activity in FY 2004.

NERI is an essential element in the Department's approach toward fostering innovation in areas such as improving light water reactor technology, advanced nuclear fuels for current nuclear power plants, and enhancing the proliferationresistance of civilian nuclear technology in order to enhance the ability of nuclear energy to help meet the Nation's future energy needs and environmental goals. The President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) determined that for the United States to maintain a viable, long-term option to use nuclear energy to meet the important energy and environmental challenges facing the future of the Nation, key issues affecting the future viability of nuclear energy must be addressed. These issues include the economics of using fission to generate electricity, concerns regarding safety and proliferation resistance, and the continuing challenges associated with nuclear waste. The PCAST Energy Research and Development Panel, in its November 1997 report, Federal Energy Research and Development for the Challenges of the TwentyFirst Century, concluded that these issues can be solved by technology research. To implement the PCAST panel's recommendations, the Department established the NERI program. This program funds innovative, investigator-initiated scientific and engineering research to solve difficult technical issues facing nuclear energy. Nuclear energy currently provides one-fifth of U.S. electricity generation and can contribute a significant portion of U.S. electrical energy production for many years to come. In this new millennium, the Nation faces new issues associated with energy supply and environmental policy. The potential role of nuclear power to address these new challenges, such as global climate change, will depend upon the ability of the Federal government, universities, national laboratories, industry, and others to pool their talents and creatively address the key challenges affecting the future of nuclear energy. The United States has always been a world leader in both the policy and technical aspects of nuclear energy. This nation operates more nuclear power plants than any other country and most of the world's operating nuclear power plants are based on U.S. light water reactor technology. Given the projected growth in global energy demand as developing nations industrialize; our strategic interests in addressing global climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear safety, economic competitiveness; and our need to satisfy growing domestic needs for energy in an environmentally responsible manner, the United States must maintain its scientific and technological leadership in nuclear energy. This leadership provides the United States a key ""seat at the table"" at on-going international discussions regarding the future implementation of nuclear technologies, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear safety, and many other issues important to U.S. policy objectives. Recognizing the importance of a focused program of international cooperation, the PCAST issued a June 1999 report on The Federal Role in International Cooperation on Energy Innovation, (http://www.ostp.gov/html/P2E.pdf) which highlights the need for an international component of the Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Research Initiative Page 67  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   NERI program to promote ""bilateral and multilateral research focused on advanced technologies for improving the cost, safety, waste management, and proliferation resistance of nuclear fission energy systems."" The report further states that: ""The costs of exploring new technological approaches that might deal effectively with the multiple challenges posed by conventional nuclear power are too great for the United States or any other single country to bear, so that a pooling of international resources is needed... Research efforts underway in Russia, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and South Korea on a variety of advanced reactor types and proliferation-resistant fuel cycles are potentially suitable foci for U.S. participation..."" The Department and its independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) have endorsed PCAST's recommendations and established, with the support and advice of the Congress, both a base NERI program and an International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (I-NERI) component. The I-NERI activity enhances the Department's ability to leverage its limited research funding with the nuclear technology research funding available in other countries while also providing the United States greater credibility and influence in international activities associated with the application of nuclear technologies. The international aspects of advanced nuclear energy took on even greater relevance in 2002, as the need to develop new, proliferation-resistant nuclear power options become part of the Nation's key dialogues with other countries. In the most recent example, President Bush and Russian President Putin agreed in May 2002 to establish a new bilateral working group designed to suggest technology cooperation between the two nations that would lead to the development of advanced, proliferationresistant nuclear technologies. Both NERI and I-NERI, which have specific objectives of improving the proliferation-resistance of civilian nuclear power technology, directly support this priority nonproliferation objective. In June 2000, NERAC issued a long-range R&D plan developed in conjunction with the nuclear community, Long Term Nuclear Technology Research and Development Plan, (http://nuclear.gov/nerac/LTRDP-ne.html) which identifies the research and technology development necessary over the next 10 to 20 years to help assure nuclear energy remains a viable electricity generation option. In addition, NERAC established a task force to identify technical opportunities to increase the proliferation resistance of nuclear power systems, and to recommend to DOE appropriate areas of research. The resulting report, Technical Opportunities to Increase the Proliferation Resistance of Global Civilian Nuclear Power Systems (TOPS), (http://nuclear.gov/nerac/tops.pdf), approved by NERAC in January 2001, provides R&D recommendations to improve the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers to the proliferation of nuclear materials. These reports are used by the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology to help guide the research conducted under NERI. The most important planning document affecting the NERI program in FY 2002 and beyond is the National Energy Policy. This comprehensive plan specifies a vital role for nuclear power in supporting the Nation's near and long-term energy requirements. The Policy highlights the need for international cooperation in the exploration of advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies and guides the Department in determining which long-term technologies it must pursue. In addition to its nuclear power-specific recommendations, the National Energy Policy also provides important guidance regarding other areas of energy, such as the need to explore advanced sources of energy for transportation. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Research Initiative Page 68  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The NERI program will also focus on developing innovative technologies to support continued efficient operation of today's nuclear power technology. The NERI program will spark new innovation to enhance the performance of light water reactor technology, including new research in advanced digital instrumentation and control, and automation technologies to improve plant performance; development of advanced nuclear fuels and fuel systems; and development of advanced ceramic materials to increase performance. NERI features a competitive, investigator-initiated, peer-reviewed selection process to fund innovative nuclear energy-related research. Modeled after successful research programs such as those conducted by the National Science Foundation and DOE's own Office of Science, the NERI program solicits proposals from the U.S. scientific and engineering community for research at universities, national laboratories, and industry. NERI encourages collaborative research and development activities among these different research organizations; as well as participation of research organizations funded by overseas governments. The Department believes that by funding creative research ideas at the Nation's science and technology institutions and companies, the United States will find new solutions to the issues associated with safety, economics, proliferation, and nuclear waste. NERI program funding is also used to fund critical program execution activities such as the independent, objective merit-peer review process used to evaluate the proposals submitted. In implementing the NERI program, the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology consults with the Office of Science to ensure that the NERI program approach to peer review is consistent with the good practices established by that office. In addition, the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology coordinates with all relevant DOE program offices to assure that the best use is made of the Department's financial, intellectual, and physical resources. The Department's independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) also provides ongoing oversight and advice on the planning and implementation of the NERI program. The international component of NERI, the I-NERI program, also uses a competitive peer-review process to select research projects. The I-NERI program allows for research opportunities with foreign collaborators through a specified cost share arrangement with each participating country. The peer review selection process for the I-NERI program includes both U.S. technical reviewers as well as international expert reviewers from the participating country. Specific research topics are identified and selected in conjunction with the international partnering countries and focus on new, next-generation nuclear energy system and fuel cycle technology concepts. Bilateral I-NERI research programs are being conducted with France's Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) and the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST); negotiations are proceeding with several other countries to expand these activities. As a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Nuclear Energy Research and Development programs, OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used to evaluate the research results achieved thus far. NERI received very high scores for the purpose, planning, and management sections of PART. Lower scores for the results and accountability section of PART were received due to the fact that initial NERI projects are just being completed and results are to be evaluated. NE has committed to implementing a number of actions to help measure the effectiveness of NERI.

Forecasts indicate that the United States will need about 428,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by 2025 - even if ambitious assumptions are made regarding implementation of energy efficiency practices and technologies. If United States electricity demand continues to grow at current rates, even more generating capacity will be needed. This growth, which powers economic expansion, would require the United States to build between 1,400 and 2,100 new power plants over the next two decades. This averages to building and commissioning 60 to 90 new power plants per year. To help meet this need for new baseload electricity generation, the National Energy Policy (NEP) has recommended expansion of nuclear energy in the United States as a major component of our Nation's energy picture. The NEP specifically recommends government support for licensing new nuclear power plants and development of next generation nuclear energy technologies for the future. Fully 20 percent of our Nation's current electricity production is generated by nuclear power plants. In order to expand the use of nuclear power to meet current and future growth in electricity demand in the United States as recommended in the National Energy Policy, the technical, regulatory, and institutional barriers which currently exist must be successfully addressed by government and industry. The Department recognizes that there are near-term and long-term elements to this challenge. The Nuclear Energy Technologies program is structured to address the challenges ahead, cooperating with industry to implement near-term goals and the international community to develop long-term technologies. To enable the deployment of new, advanced nuclear power plants in the United States in the relatively near-term--by the end of the decade--it is essential to demonstrate the new, untested Federal regulatory and licensing processes for the siting, construction, and operation of new plant designs. In addition, independent expert analysis commissioned by the Department and carried out by the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) has shown that the research and development on near-term advanced reactor concepts that offer enhancements to safety and economics is needed to enable these new technologies to come to market. For the longer term, the Department believes that Generation IV nuclear energy systems can play a vital role in fulfilling the Nation's long-term energy needs. Generation IV systems represent a new generation of nuclear energy and fuel cycle technologies that can be made available after the end of the decade but no later than 2030, and offer significant advances in the areas of sustainability, proliferation resistance and physical protection, safety, and economics. Growing concerns for the environment favor energy sources that can satisfy the need for electricity and other energy-intensive products on a sustainable basis with minimal environmental impact. Advances in sustainability entail improvements in fuel utilization and waste management. Advances in proliferation resistance and physical protection will further decrease the possibility that nuclear plants could prove to be viable targets for terrorist groups or that nuclear materials present in civilian fuel cycles could be diverted by proliferants. Advances in safety--with a goal of eliminating entirely the need for offsite emergency response--will improve public confidence in the safety of nuclear energy while providing improved investment protection for plant owners. Advances in economics will ensure competitive life cycle cost and Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 75  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   acceptable financial risk. Next-generation nuclear energy systems can serve a vital role in the Nation's long-term, diversified energy supply. The Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative is also at the heart of major initiatives announced by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation to consider ways the two nations could work together to improve the proliferation-resistance of civilian nuclear energy systems. Nuclear Power 2010 - The Department believes it is important to deploy new baseload nuclear generating capacity within the decade to support the National Energy Policy objectives of energy supply diversity and energy security. A major obstacle to the deployment of new nuclear plants is the uncertainties associated with the Federal regulatory processes and the financial and schedule risks resulting from these uncertainties. The Nuclear Power 2010 program is a joint government/industry cost-shared activity to develop and certify advanced reactor technologies and demonstrate new regulatory processes such that U.S. industry would be in a position to order new nuclear power plants by 2005. Nuclear Power 2010 is an integrated program that aggressively pursues regulatory approvals and reactor technology development in a phased approach, leading to deployment of new nuclear plants in the United States by 2010. A Near-Term Deployment Working Group, operating under the auspices of the Department's independent Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, and composed of representatives from the nuclear industry, national laboratories, and United States universities, initiated a concerted effort in FY 2001 to identify the technical, institutional, and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants by the end of the decade. On October 31, 2001, the working group issued, A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United States by 2010, which recommends actions to be taken by industry and the Department to support deployment of new advanced nuclear power plants in the United States by 2010 (see www.nuclear.gov). The recommendations of the near-term deployment roadmap, which have broad industry support, provide the basis for the activities of the Nuclear Power 2010 program. The Nuclear Power 2010 program will achieve near-term deployment of new power plants in the United States through cost-shared demonstration of the new, untested regulatory processes and cost-shared development of advanced reactor technologies. The regulatory tasks include the demonstration of the Early Site Permit (ESP) and combined Construction and Operating License (COL) processes to reduce licensing uncertainties and minimize the attendant financial risks to the licensee. The technology development activities support research and development to finalize and certify those advanced reactor designs which U. S. power generation companies are willing to build. The Nuclear Power 2010 program incorporates competitive procurement processes for the regulatory demonstration and technology development activities and requires a minimum of 50 percent industry cost share for most program activities. Through the competitive procurement process, it is expected that innovative business arrangements will be formed between power generating companies and reactor vendors with strong and common incentives to successfully build and operate new plants in the United States.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 76  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The Nuclear Power 2010 program will pursue competitively-selected, cost-shared cooperative agreements with nuclear power generating companies for the preparation and submittal of Early Site Permit (ESP) and combined Construction and Operating License (COL) applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The successful demonstration of the ESP and COL regulatory processes will lead to the licensing of multiple sites for locating new nuclear power plants, and the issuance of a license to construct and operate at least one advanced nuclear power plant. In FY 2002, ESP scoping studies were completed to evaluate site suitability and to develop schedule and resource estimates for siting new nuclear power plants at both federal and commercial sites. ESP demonstration projects, cost-shared with three U.S. power generation companies, were also initiated in FY 2002 to prepare actual ESP applications and submit them to the NRC for approval. The ESP applications will be submitted to the NRC in the last quarter of FY 2003. ESP activities in FY 2004 will focus on working with the industry and the Commission to pursue this process to conclusion. Final NRC issuance of Early Site Permits is expected in 2005. The ESP applicants will be expected to:  conduct pre-application interactions with NRC to achieve resolution on the use of existing site data and on the technical bases for site seismic analysis;  prepare a plant parameters envelope for each application providing site, plant design and operating information related to environmental protection, site safety, and emergency planning;  prepare the safety analysis report, the environmental report, and emergency planning report required for the ESP application; and  submit an ESP application to the NRC for approval and respond to NRC requests for information. During FY 2003 and FY 2004, the Department will solicit and competitively select a cost shared project with power generating companies to demonstrate the combined Construction and Operating License (COL) process. The activities for COL demonstration will result in NRC approval of a COL application by 2008. The COL applicant will be expected to:  prepare a final safety analysis report and probabilistic risk assessment for a specific advanced reactor design;  prepare an Inspection, Testing, Analyses, and Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) report for use in demonstrating that the facility has been constructed and will operate in conformity with NRC regulations;   develop a detailed construction plan including construction sequence and schedule; and submit a COL application to the NRC for approval. FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 77   The Department will also pursue activities focused on the development and utility selection of at least one advanced reactor in time to allow an industry decision for a new plant deployment by the end of the decade. The Department will explore the development of consortia or joint venture project teams comprised of power generation companies and reactor vendors to develop the technology necessary for NRC design certification and conduct other activities associated with deployment of advanced nuclear reactors. The reactor technology development activities will be cost-shared, with industry contributing at least 50 percent of the required funds. The Department will initiate in FY 2003 a nuclear power plant project cost and construction evaluation to assess the cost, schedule construction methods for the most likely advanced reactor designs to be built in the near term. This study will independently examine the reactor vendor design and cost estimates, assess the modular and unique construction techniques and construction schedules. The study will also identify promising improvements to the construction methods, techniques and sequences needed to support new nuclear power plant deployment in this decade. In particular, the Department will investigate successful techniques used to reduce the time it takes to construct nuclear plants in countries such as Japan. These techniques involve modular construction, factory fabrication, and heavy lift techniques on major nuclear plant buildings and components. During FY 2002 and early FY 2003, the Department conducted an evaluation of the business case for new nuclear power plants in the United States and the associated financial risks faced by nuclear power companies. In addition, risk mitigation techniques were identified and are being evaluated for potential affect on the financial risks. In FY 2003, the Department will also initiate a study on economic policy benefits and impacts resulting from the deployment of new nuclear power plants in the United States. The information obtained from these studies will be used to focus the program's activities on issues of the greatest impact. In FY 2004, the Department will also continue its advanced gas-cooled reactor fuel development and qualification program in cooperation with the NRC. This important program supports future deployment of advanced gas reactor technology by reducing market entry risks posed by the technical uncertainties associated with fuel production and performance. The fuel development and qualification program is a cooperative government and industry effort being led by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The Department is also coordinating these research activities with the NRC to leverage planned fuel irradiation tests to meet their research needs. The development of a comprehensive gas reactor fuel development and qualification plan will be completed in FY 2002. In FY 2003, the fuel development effort will identify the important coated-particle properties that lead to satisfactory fuel performance, develop a laboratory scale coated-particle fuel fabrication process, produce demonstration fuel for fuel performance testing, and manufacture the test fixture for inserting the fuel into the ATR. During FY 2004, the Department, in cooperation with the NRC and industry, will produce gas reactor kernels and develop coating and compacting technologies. The design and development of irradiation test capsules for testing gas-cooled reactor fuel in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) will be initiated. The fuel testing, starting in FY 2006, will be required to demonstrate gas reactor fuel performance and generate the fuel performance data needed for licensing gas-cooled reactors in the United States. The fuel performance data is required for establishing the technical basis for regulating gas-cooled reactor technologies in the United States. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 78  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   As a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Nuclear Energy Research and Development programs, OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used to evaluate the research results achieved thus far. Nuclear Power 2010 received very high scores for the purpose, planning and management sections of PART. Lower scores for the results and accountability section of PART were received due to the fact that Nuclear Power 2010 is in the early stages of development. NE has committed to implementing a number of actions to help measure the effectiveness of Nuclear Power 2010. Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative  Generation IV nuclear energy systems are a new generation of nuclear reactor and fuel cycle systems that can be made available to the market after the end of the decade, but before 2030. These systems will be designed to offer significant advances toward challenging sustainability, safety, proliferation resistance and economics requirements developed by the Department's Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and vetted with the international research community. The Generation IV Technology Roadmap is being prepared under the auspices of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) and the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The GIF is a formal, chartered organization of governments with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. The Roadmap, prepared by nearly one hundred experts from GIF countries and international organizations, will be issued in FY 2003, and will outline the benefits, the technical and institutional barriers, and the research needs for the most promising nuclear energy system concepts. The Roadmap, which will be provided to Congress in early 2003, will serve as the organizing basis for national, bilateral, and multilateral research and development activities for the development of Generation IV systems. The objectives of the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative are to:  identify nuclear energy system concepts and associated fuel cycles that offer the greatest potential for meeting Generation IV technology goals;  set forth a long-term research, development, and demonstration plan for those concepts and fuel cycles;   conduct viability research and development on the most promising concepts; and  conduct a technology development and demonstration program leading to commercial deployment of the selected concepts. The Generation IV Technology Roadmap will identify the six most promising nuclear energy systems, complete with front and back end of the fuel cycle, power conversion systems, waste management, and other nuclear infrastructure elements. Generation IV nuclear energy systems also include energy conversion systems that produce non-electricity products such as hydrogen, desalinated water, and process heat. Although the Roadmap will not be complete until FY 2003, the GIF made a final selection of the six most promising concepts at its May 2002 meeting. While the Department has not yet decided upon which of the concepts it will eventually focus, all of the technologies are of considerable interest. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 79  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The six innovative, next-generation systems selected include two gas-cooled, one water-cooled, two liquid-metal-cooled, and one molten-salt-based reactor concept. Key research objectives for these technologies will include such items as demonstration of advanced fuels and materials - including irradiation performance of recycled fuel and passive safety confirmation tests; development of fuels and structural materials capable of withstanding the conditions in the supercritical regime; and development of advanced proliferation-resistant fuels capable of high burn-up and materials capable of withstanding the corrosive environment of a lead/bismuth coolant. The goal of the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative is to address the fundamental research and development issues necessary to establish the viability of the advanced system concepts. By successfully addressing the fundamental R&D issues, the concepts are highly likely to attract future private-sector sponsorship and ultimate commercialization by the private sector. Most of the early viability issues relate to materials capabilities for fuel, core, and components, although viability issues also exist in actinide recovery during spent fuel recycling and safety approaches for certain of the reactor concepts. FY 2003 efforts will focus on establishing conceptual designs for the nuclear energy systems of most interest to the Department. In developing the conceptual designs, the technical requirement envelopes for the specific technology development areas for the reactor, energy conversion, and fuel cycle facilities will also be identified. These requirements will guide the development of new fuels, core designs, in-core and out-of-core structural materials, direct-cycle turbomachinery, and process-heat applications for Generation IV nuclear energy systems based on reactors such as the Very High Temperature Reactor, the Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor, or the Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor. In addition, crosscutting R&D on new materials, new fuel concepts, safety approaches, and turbomachinery that are applicable to most energy systems will be initiated. Laboratory-scale test loops will be planned and/or erected to test materials at high temperatures in helium, supercritical water, lead alloys, and supercritical carbon dioxide. The Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative research and development will be closely coordinated with the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative which is developing the advanced, proliferationresistant fuels and fuel cycle systems for the Generation IV reactors. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative and Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative are pursuing challenging technologies that require the development of advanced, proliferation-resistant transmutation fuels, associated treatment technologies, and fast neutron systems to destroy long-lived radioactive components of spent fuel responsible for the long-term radiotoxicity and heat generation. These new technologies will be capable of operating with far higher content of plutonium and other actinides than is presently feasible. In FY 2004, these efforts will be expanded and, using early results, focused on crucial viability issues and technology choices. As a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Nuclear Energy Research and Development programs, OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used to evaluate the research results achieved thus far. Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative received very high scores for the purpose, planning and management sections of PART. Lower scores for the results and accountability section of PART were received due to the fact that Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative is in the early Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Energy Technologies Page 80  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   stages of development.

This report identifies the recommended actions to be taken by industry and government to enable one or more orders for new commercial nuclear power plants in the United States by 2005 and deployment by 2010. The report's key recommendations call for the demonstration of the regulatory licensing processes of 10 CFR Part 52 for Early Site Permit (ESP), Design Certification, and combined Construction and Operating License (COL). In FY 2002, the Department:  Completed competitively selected cost-shared Early Site Permit (ESP) scoping studies by power generating companies to evaluate site suitability and to develop schedule and resource estimates for siting new nuclear power plants at both federal and commercial sites.  Established cooperative agreements with three power generation companies for a competitively selected cost-shared demonstration project to prepare ESP applications and submit them to the NRC for approval in order to fully demonstrate the NRC regulatory process (10 CFR Part 52) for the siting of nuclear power plants at commercial sites having existing nuclear power plants.  Completed a detailed plan for an advanced gas-cooled reactor fuel development and qualification program, and complete the commercial advanced gas reactor feasibility study initiated in FY 2001.  Continued its cooperation with the NRC on the development of a gas reactor regulatory and licensing framework initiated in FY 2001 including conduct of an evaluation of gas-cooled reactor technologies and identification of technical issues and research required for licensing.  Completed a Nuclear Business Case Study, developed with expert input from the financial and nuclear industries, to identify the necessary conditions under which utilities would add new nuclear capacity, and to develop strategies to close the financial and technology gaps which pose the highest risk.

Significant progress in hydrogen combustion engines and fuels cells is bringing the day closer when transportation using hydrogen fuel is a reality. The primary challenges to using large quantities of hydrogen as part of the Nation's overall energy infrastructure are the cost and environmental impacts associated with its production, storage, and delivery. As an efficient, emission-free energy source, nuclear energy provides a unique opportunity to produce hydrogen economically and without greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the only economical, large-scale method of hydrogen production involves the conversion of methane into hydrogen through a steam reforming process. This process is efficient, but produces ten kilograms of greenhouse gases for every kilogram of hydrogen, defeating the primary advantage of using hydrogen--its environmental benefits. Another existing method, electrolysis, converts water into hydrogen using electricity. Electrolysis is typically used for small production quantities and will probably be uneconomical for large-scale production. Additionally, the environmental benefits of electrolysis are reduced unless a non-emitting technology is used to produce the electricity, such as nuclear energy. Recent research conducted under the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) has indicated strong potential for using a thermo-chemical water splitting process to produce hydrogen economically on a commercial scale without the release of greenhouse gases. One of the characteristics of these thermo chemical processes is that they all require very high temperatures--as high as 800 to 1000C. Generating these extreme process temperatures in an environmentally benign way is very challenging. The Department believes that advanced, high temperature nuclear energy systems can provide the heat necessary for these processes. In fact, preliminary estimates indicate that hydrogen produced using nuclear-driven thermo-chemical processes would be only slightly more expensive than gasoline without emissions-avoidance incentives. Japan has developed a program to pursue nuclear production of hydrogen using their High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR), and several other countries have shown great interest in developing the technology as well. The Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative will address the need for greater utilization of our energy resources by investigating the uses for nuclear power on an integrated basis as both a heat source, an electricity source, and a source of clean hydrogen which can supplant fossil fuels in our transportation system. With nuclear technology producing process heat and hydrogen as well as electric power, the vision outlined by President Bush in his June 11, 2002, speech on global climate change, in which future energy use need not result in the emission of greenhouse gases, can be brought to reality much sooner than might be commonly believed. In order to realize this vision, the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative will study potential nuclear energy configurations, conduct research and development on enabling technologies, demonstrate nuclear-based hydrogen producing technologies, and develop deployment alternatives to meet future needs for increased hydrogen consumption.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Research and Development Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative Page 87  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   An integrated Hydrogen Posture Plan, a joint effort of the Offices of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE), Fossil Energy (FE), Science (SC), and Management, Budget, and Evaluation (ME), will highlight program planning for R&D on potential production sources of hydrogen, the infrastructure required to support the distribution of hydrogen, and end-use applications such as those being explored through FreedomCAR. NE will build upon this plan and the National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap, announced by Secretary Abraham in November 2002, by developing a nuclear hydrogen technology roadmap, which will be completed in FY 2004. Domestic and international experts on hydrogen generation and nuclear technology will be assembled to define the research and development requirements for implementing an integrated nuclear hydrogen production plant. This effort will be coordinated with other departmental elements and involve experts from industry, universities, and national laboratories. This roadmap will be reviewed by the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC), an independent federal advisory committee, and will further define the course of research, development and demonstration activities for the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. Investigating and demonstrating these nuclear-based applications will require the advancement of the science and technologies to produce hydrogen through thermo-chemical water splitting. Research and development will be conducted that focuses on the development of the thermo-chemical water splitting technologies that can be driven by nuclear systems and the underlying sciences supporting these advanced technologies such as high temperature and corrosive resistant materials and advanced chemical systems analysis. The research and development will involve laboratory and pilot-scale technology demonstrations. This program will complement the research conducted by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy on hydrogen infrastructure and end-uses to evaluate future nuclear energy systems and their potential to meet growing demands for emission-free energy generation, distribution, and transportation systems in a fully integrated fashion.

The development of a detailed concept of an integrated reactor and hydrogen production plant is an important part of this process, since several advanced high-temperature reactor concepts are compatible with thermo-chemical hydrogen generation processes. By the end of FY 2004, the Department will develop a Nuclear Hydrogen Technology roadmap to evaluate potential chemical processes and nuclear technologies for the production of hydrogen, evaluate the economic benefits and environmental impacts of each process, identify the most promising candidate(s), and define the research and development necessary to support future demonstration of an integrated nuclear hydrogen production plant. The Department will investigate the most promising nuclear hydrogen-production processes. Upon completion of the roadmap, a facility concept will be developed that integrates a nuclear hydrogen production system with an advanced reactor design. As part of the concept evaluation, process flow models will be developed to determine efficiencies and production rates of the combined nuclear hydrogen system. Research and development on key enabling technologies such as high temperature and corrosion-resistant materials, chemical process reaction rates and phase separation data will be initiated. Laboratory scale testing of the selected thermo-chemical process will be initiated to determine hydrogen production rates and system efficiencies.

While compared to other industrial waste, spent fuel is relatively small in quantity, it is highly toxic for many thousands of years, and its disposal requires that many political, societal, technical, and regulatory issues be addressed. As a result, researchers in the U.S. and other countries who believe that the world cannot turn its back on the benefits that nuclear energy offers--lack of harmful emissions; reliable, economic baseload energy; etc.--have developed concepts for new, advanced technologies for dealing with spent fuel. For many years, several countries around the world have pursued advanced technologies that could treat and transmute spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants. These technologies have the potential to dramatically reduce the quantity and toxicity of waste requiring geologic disposal. Over the last three years, the United States has joined this international effort and found considerable merit in this area of advanced research. While these technologies are not an alternative for a geologic repository, they could provide a means to optimize use of the first U.S. repository and reduce the technical need for additional repositories. These technologies could also provide other important benefits such as enhancing national security by reducing inventories of commercially-generated plutonium (which is contained in all commercial spent fuel and can, over succeeding decades, become easier to extract) and enhancing national energy security by recovering the significant energy value contained in spent nuclear fuel. (The 44,000 metric tonnes of spent nuclear fuel currently stored at nuclear power plant sites across the country contain the energy equivalent of over 6 billion barrels of oil, or about two full years of U.S. oil imports.) Through the research conducted by the Department and its international partners, sufficient evidence exists to warrant cautious optimism that the benefits of these technologies can be realized in a proliferation-resistant manner. The Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) program (predecessor to AFCI) and the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative have enabled the Department to clearly identify the goals and approach for a comprehensive program to realize the benefits possible from spent nuclear fuel treatment and transmutation. Research completed thus far points to a multi-phased Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) program comprising of two elements that would be conducted in parallel as part of an integrated research effort. The first element would be an intermediate-term technology program element--AFCI Series One--which emphasizes advanced technical enhancements to the current commercial nuclear power infrastructure. The goal of the AFCI Series One technology effort is to develop advanced proliferation-resistant fuel treatment and fabrication technologies that could be deployed by 2015. AFCI Series Two consists of a phased approach to developing the technologies needed to address the longterm issues associated with spent nuclear fuel management--namely, reducing long-term radiotoxicity and heat load. These two program elements are part and parcel of the integrated AFCI effort. Each builds on research and development conducted under the other element and both will be necessary to enable the United States to develop a long-term approach to the nuclear fuel cycle that meets its energy, environment, and nonproliferation policy imperatives. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 93   Based on research conducted to date, the following objectives are attainable through the AFCI program:  Reduce Spent Fuel Volume : Develop and implement, by the middle of the next decade, proliferation-resistant technology to significantly reduce the absolute volume of high-level nuclear waste and lower the cost of its disposal;  Separate Long-Lived, Highly Toxic Elements (i.e., actinides such as plutonium and americium): Develop and deploy, by approximately 2030, advanced, proliferation-resistant treatment and transmutation technologies that will both significantly reduce the volume and heat generation of spent nuclear fuel and create waste forms sufficiently clean of long-lived, highly toxic species to reduce the time it is hazardous from 300,000 years to less than 1,000 years; and  Reclaim Spent Fuel's Valuable Energy: Develop and deploy, by the middle of the next decade, advanced nuclear fuels that will enable the proliferation-resistant consumption of plutonium in existing light water reactors or advanced gas-cooled reactors that may be available in the future. This work can realize the vision anticipated by the National Energy Policy to explore advanced technologies to deal with spent nuclear fuel in cooperation with our international partners. The AFCI program also implements the recommendations of the National Energy Policy with respect to reconsideration of next-generation fuel cycle technologies, specifically: ""....United States should reexamine its policies to allow for research, development and deployment of fuel conditioning methods (such as pyroprocessing) that reduce waste streams and enhance proliferation resistance. In doing so, the United States will continue to discourage the accumulation of separated plutonium, worldwide."" ""The United States should also consider technologies, in collaboration with international partners with highly developed fuel cycles and a record of close cooperation, to develop reprocessing and fuel treatment technologies that are cleaner, more efficient, less waste intensive, and more proliferation resistant."" Working closely in an integrated manner with the Department's Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative, the AFCI program will also develop advanced, proliferation resistant fuels and fuel cycle technologies needed for the next-generation reactor systems under cooperative development on an international basis through the Generation IV program. The Department will continue to emphasize joint collaborative activities in spent fuel recycling research, design, development, and demonstration. Considerable expertise has been developed overseas on these technologies, and the potential for significant cooperation and collaboration is very high. The Department has already reached agreements with the country of France for technical expertise in aqueous separations, fuels, and test facilities. Furthermore, Russia is supplying information regarding lead-bismuth technology, fabrication and testing of neutron targets, expertise in fuels and separations, and advanced reactor development. Other potential international partners include Italy, Spain, Japan, and South Korea. As a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Nuclear Energy Research and Development programs, OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) was used to evaluate the research results achieved Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 94   thus far. AFCI received very high scores for the purpose, planning, and management sections of PART. Lower scores for the results and accountability section of PART were received due to the fact that the AFCI program is still in the early stages of its development. NE has committed to implementing a number of actions to help measure the effectiveness of AFCI. Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative Series One AFCI Series One will address the intermediate-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel, primarily by reducing the volume and heat generation of material requiring geologic disposition. Doing so will support the Nation's first repository and reduce and possibly eliminate the technical need for additional repositories. This area of work will include creating the proliferation-resistant processes and fuels to enable the destruction of significant quantities of commercially generated plutonium in light water reactors or high temperature gas-cooled reactors in operation during the middle of the next decade. The goal of the AFCI Series One technology effort is to develop advanced proliferation-resistant spent fuel treatment and proliferation-resistant fuel technologies that could be deployed by 2015. Significant advancements have been made in proliferation-resistant spent fuel treatment technologies (UREX). The UREX process removes the uranium from the spent fuel at such a high level of purity that it is sufficiently free of high-level radioactive contaminants to allow it to be disposed of as low-level waste or reused as reactor fuel. Laboratory scale UREX tests have proven uranium separation at purity levels of 99.999 percent, making it sufficiently free of high level contaminates to allow it to be disposed of as low level waste or re-used as reactor fuel. If spent fuel were processed in this manner, the potential exists to significantly reduce the quantity of high level waste requiring disposal in a geologic repository. This technology will require additional research and development to provide specific feed material from an advanced derivative of UREX technology (i.e., ""UREX+"") to manufacture proliferation-resistant transmutation fuels for both light water reactors (existing and new) and gas-cooled reactors (which could be built in the U.S. in the next decade). The real challenge is, therefore, development of proliferationresistant fuels and the technology to fabricate these fuels. Transmutation of plutonium and other actinides contained in spent nuclear fuel in nuclear power plants can provide a 25 percent increase in the energy extracted from nuclear fuel compared with a oncethrough fuel cycle. This increase will make a significant contribution to the Nation's energy security. However, transmutation may provide an even more important contribution by eliminating the plutonium present in spent nuclear fuel. In the U.S. alone, commercial spent nuclear fuel contains about 4,400 metric tons of plutonium  which becomes increasingly accessible as spent fuel cools over succeeding decades. The Administration has made impressive progress towards the development of the Nation's first repository, but this progress--which is essential to the future of nuclear energy in the United States, has come after a long and difficult process. Based on that experience, contemplating a time when a second--and perhaps a third--deep geologic repository may be needed is not a comforting prospect for those who anticipate an expanded role for nuclear energy in the future. Spent fuel treatment and transmutation can expand the technical capacity of the first repository by providing significant reductions in waste volume and reducing the scientific need for additional capacity. While a geological repository is required even if this research is fully successful, AFCI technologies can help reduce the cost of geologic disposal and optimize the planned facility at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative FY 2004 Congressional Budget  Page 95   technology, therefore, can help ensure that nuclear energy will be able to contribute to the Nation's energy supply far into the future. Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative Series Two AFCI Series Two will address the long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel. Specifically, this effort will develop fuel cycle technologies that could sharply reduce the long-term radiotoxicity and heat load of high-level waste sent to a geologic repository, and support development of potential Generation IV fuel cycles. AFCI Series One and AFCI Series Two are complementary and, as a result, they will be managed in tandem as part of a multi-phased effort to develop advanced spent fuel treatment and transmutation technologies. For example, treatment technologies that emerge from AFCI Series One may prove to be invaluable front-end steps to more advanced processes targeted in AFCI Series Two. Integrating these technology programs will be essential to the success of the overall effort. AFCI Series Two consists of a phased approach to developing the technologies needed to address the long-term issues associated with spent nuclear fuel management  specifically, reducing long-term radiotoxicity and heat load. AFCI Series Two will further develop the AFCI Series One spent fuel treatment technologies to fully separate the most toxic, long-lived radioactive components of the spent fuel responsible for the long-term radiotoxicity and heat generation. AFCI Series Two will also develop the transmutation technologies needed to destroy these long-lived radioisotopes. Current commercial spent fuel would take about 300,000 years to decay to the same level of toxicity as natural uranium ore. By destroying these radioactive components in spent fuel, it may be possible to reduce the time it takes for the waste in a repository to decay to the toxicity of natural uranium ore in 1,000 years or less. While a deep geologic repository is still needed, this technology can optimize its cost and technical performance. This is an aggressive technology goal and achieving it will require the development of advanced transmutation fuels and associated treatment technologies that will enable the use of fast neutron systems to destroy long-lived radioactive species. These new technologies must be capable of operating with far higher content of plutonium and other actinides than is presently feasible. The AFCI Series Two research and development will be closely coordinated with the Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative which is developing the fast neutron reactor systems that will use transmutation fuels. AFCI Series Two will develop the advanced, proliferation-resistant fuels and fuel cycle systems for the Generation IV reactors. The AFCI Series Two research and development will capitalize on the Department's previous investments in pyroprocessing technology development that is being demonstrated on a laboratory-scale at ANL-W with the treatment and management of EBR-II sodium bonded spent nuclear fuel. The Department remains committed to meeting its obligations to the state of Idaho to treat and remove the EBR-II fuel. The Series Two activities also include investigation of scaling up to a commercial-scale the pyroprocessing technologies currently being demonstrated at ANL-W and research into advanced technologies that could accelerate the disposition of the EBR-II fuel. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative  Page 96  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The AFCI Series Two research will develop the enabling technologies and provide a practical demonstration of transmutation technologies. Detailed information needed for the commercial deployment of this technology, including specific capabilities, operational methods, waste characteristics and estimated volumes, costs, hardware, software, and facility requirements will be developed on the basis of the research results. Transmutation Science Education This portion of the AFCI program continues the successful fellowship program established under the AAA program to support the development of new U.S. scientists and engineers needed to develop the technologies to deal with commercial spent nuclear fuel. In addition, the program will continue the complementary university research program based at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas to fully integrate universities into the larger research and development effort. This important program supports the development of new U.S. scientists and engineers needed to develop transmutation technologies, and provides the basic research in material science, spent fuel treatment, and other key areas of basic research needed to support development of AFCI Series Two technologies.

This program ensures that the Department's unique facilities are available to meet the vital missions of the Federal government and that these assets are maintained in a safe, secure, environmentally-compliant and cost-effective manner. The Infrastructure program keeps unique DOE facilities and supporting infrastructure in a user-ready status. Facilities supported by this program include reactors, hot cells, and other vital infrastructure needed to carry out advanced nuclear energy technology research and development, construct power systems essential for important national security missions and space exploration, and produce, package and ship radioisotopes for medical and scientific applications. DOE stimulates great advances in science by making its nuclear facilities available to a large user base. While we do not believe it is appropriate for DOE to subsidize the operational costs of our users, the Department does have the responsibility to maintain its unique facility capabilities in a manner that supports their application to missions funded by various governmental and scientific users. In July 2002, the Secretary of Energy announced a major mission realignment for the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), establishing the site as the Nation's leading center of nuclear research and development. As a result, oversight of the INEEL transferred from Office of Environmental Management (EM) to the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE). INEEL will become the ""command center"" for NE's strategic nuclear energy research and development enterprise, INEEL's revised mission will play a major role in Generation IV nuclear energy systems development, advanced fuel cycle development, and space nuclear power and propulsion applications. The INEEL will transition its research and development focus from environmental programs to nuclear energy programs while maintaining its multi-program national laboratory status to best serve ongoing and future DOE and national needs. While INEEL will focus on its new role as the center for nuclear research and development as a multi-program national laboratory, the Department will enhance its focus and implementation of essential environmental cleanup activities. The INEEL will continue to pursue appropriate roles in national security, environmental and other activities. The FY 2004 budget reflects the transfer of the Idaho infrastructure operations and safeguards and security activities, as well as safeguards and security activities for ANL-W from EM to NE. In March 2000, the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) led the creation of the Nuclear Science and Technology Infrastructure Roadmap for the entire Department. This study examined the capabilities of the DOE's accelerators, reactors, and hot cells. It also evaluated current nuclear technology missions and facility staffing levels. Finally, the roadmap estimated future mission requirements and compared them to available and planned facility capabilities, highlighting capability gaps. The Department is refining this analysis with a series of more detailed, site-specific assessment that will not only highlight infrastructure gaps, but also identify requirements regarding to maintenance and upgrade of existing facilities. As a first step, NERAC is examining the nuclear R&D infrastructure at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National LaboratoryWest to identify the maintenance and upgrades required to meet the Department's nuclear R&D activities planned at Idaho. This initial assessment will be completed in February 2003. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 103  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   In a preliminary analysis of its infrastructure requirements, NE has identified the following major midterm performance goals that require initial funding in FY 2004:   By FY 2005, complete equipment installation for Uranium-233 downblending; and By FY 2006, eliminate the backlog of essential maintenance at critical user and support facilities.  Program Strategic Performance Goal ER7-4: Maintain and enhance national nuclear capabilities by producing highly-trained nuclear scientists and engineers to meet the Nation's energy, environmental, health care, and national security needs; preserving critical user facilities and nuclear materials in a safe, secure, environmentally-compliant, and cost-effective manner to support national priorities; replenishing Federal technical and management staff with emphasis on obtaining high-caliber junior professionals with diverse backgrounds; and delivering isotope products and services for commercial, medical, and research applications where there is no private sector capability or sufficient capacity does not exist to meet United States needs such that by December 2004, deliveries continue to be made to customers as needed. Performance Indicators: Progress will be measured by: - Percent on time/within budget for cost and schedule milestones for upgrades and construction of key nuclear facilities. - Percent unscheduled downtime for each key nuclear facility. - Number of annual deliveries for isotope products and services. - Percent of customer specifications met for isotope products and services. - A 95 percent success rate for preventing unauthorized intrusions into security areas; including cyber systems, that result in site degradation.

(MIXED RESULTS) During FY 2002, no national security incidents occurred within NE Idaho sitewide cyber systems and security areas that caused unacceptable risk or damage to the Department. (MET GOAL)  Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts  In FY 2002, initiated a competitive procurement of a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). This effort will be conducted using funding provided by NASA.  In March 2002, upon the successful and on-time completion of the EBR-II Shutdown activity, the required long-term surveillance and maintenance activities for the deactivated EBR-II plant systems and equipment were incorporated into the ANL-W Operations Infrastructure activity. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 105  FY 2004 Congressional Budget    In FY 2002, following the events of September 11, 2001, the Department identified the need to enhance security for its radioisotope power system heat source and assembly and test operations at the Mound Site in Ohio or to transfer the operations to another site where security was already in place. After completing an Environmental Assessment and cost evaluations of four alternative sites, the Department decided to locate these operations at the ANL-W site in Idaho.  By September 2003, complete construction of the Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANCE) to produce medical and research short-lived accelerator isotopes.  Beginning in FY 2003, the Department will limit its request for isotope production funds to the amount necessary to maintain its essential isotope production infrastructure in a safe, environmentally sound, reliable operating condition ready to serve the needs of the isotope customers. No appropriated funds will be used for the direct cost of isotope production. Instead, customers will be asked to pay all direct production costs.  Beginning in FY 2004, the Uranium-233 (U-233) project will transfer from Defense Programs to NE. In FY 2004, Phase I, Planning and Design of the U-233 Project, which includes detailed project planning, process and facility modification designs, development of safety documentation, and development of Phase II cost estimates, will be accomplished.  Beginning in FY 2004, the facilities and infrastructure activities previously funded in the Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems program and the Medical Isotope Program have been included in the Radiological Facilities Management program. In addition, the titles of these programs will change to the Space and Defense Infrastructure program and the Medical Isotopes Infrastructure program. This will more accurately reflect the activities being performed at NE managed sites and facilities.  Beginning in FY 2004, responsibility for oversight of the INEEL will transfer to the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, where it will become a major contributor to initiatives such as Generation IV nuclear energy systems and development of advanced, proliferation-resistant fuel cycle technology. The Idaho landlord activities previously funded by EM will be merged with the TRA landlord activities, previously funded under NE's Radiological Facilities Management account, into a single program, INEEL Infrastructure. In addition, the ANL-W Operations program and the new INEEL Infrastructure program will be funded under the Idaho Facilities Management account.  In FY 2003, the safeguards and security budget for Argonne National Laboratory  West was transferred from the Office of Science to the Office of Environmental Management. In FY 2004, the safeguards and security funding for Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory  West will transfer to the Office of Nuclear Energy Science and Technology. The ANL-W safeguards and security activities and the Idaho safeguards and security activities will be merged into a single NE program, Idaho Sitewide Safeguards and Security.

ANL is located at two sites. The Illinois site, ANL-East, is the main laboratory and occupies 1500 acres surrounded by a forest preserve about 25 miles southwest of the Chicago Loop. The Idaho site, ANL-West, is located within the boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in Southeastern Idaho about 35 miles west of Idaho Falls. The capabilities on ANL are essential to meeting objectives defined in the National Energy Policy as well as meeting national security goals. Typically, basic research is conducted at ANL-East, with largescale testing and development conducted at ANL-West. For example, experiments, modeling, and analysis at ANL-East resulted in the development of the electrometallurgical technology that was demonstrated at ANL-West through the treatment of a limited quantity of sodium-bonded spent nuclear fuel. The capabilities of ANL-West also include nuclear fuel development, post-irradiation examinations, waste and nuclear material characterization, and development of dry, interim storage for spent fuel and other highly radioactive materials. Activities under the ANL-W Operations effort involve a number of significant facilities at ANL-West, including the Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF), Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF), Fuel Manufacturing Facility (FMF), Analytical Laboratory (AL), Electron Microscopy Laboratory (EML), and Radioactive Scrap and Waste Facility (RSWF). These facilities are supported by several other nuclear, radiological and industrial support and office facilities. In addition, the Zero Power Physics Reactor Mock Up Building (Building 792) will be upgraded and outfitted for the radioisotope power systems heat source and test and assembly operations being transferred from the Mound Site. Due to security issues, these activities are being transferred to ANL-W. The HFEF is a versatile, modern hot cell facility that is operated to characterize and package spent fuel and radioactive waste, including high-level waste, which could ultimately be placed in a geologic repository. The FCF demonstrated the treatment of sodium-bonded spent nuclear fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II using electrometallurgical treatment technology and is being used to treat the EBR-II spent fuel inventory. The EBR-II is a liquid metal cooled fast reactor at ANL-West that operated successfully conducting research and producing electrical power for 30 years. It has been defueled and was deactivated in March 2002 on schedule and within budget. The FMF is currently being used to develop and test fuel for research reactors, and to verify suitability of waste forms that would result from electrometallurgical treatment. The AL and the EML provide analytical capabilities in support of electrometallurgical treatment technology and the development of waste forms for the resulting high level waste that will be suitable for long-term geologic disposal. The RSWF provides a fully permitted interim dry underground temporary storage capability for a variety of experimental spent fuels and radioactive scrap. Other facilities at ANL-West, such as the Zero Power Physics Reactor, the Transient Reactor Test Facility and the Sodium Process Facility (SPF), while not Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 109  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   currently operating, provide a number of reactor physics, core design, nuclear materials, and waste treatment testing capabilities. The SPF was used to convert radioactive sodium into a chemically stable, low-level waste form. The sodium that was converted included legacy sodium from the Enrico Fermi Atomic Power Plant (Fermi-I) in Michigan, which was stored at ANL-West and the primary and secondary sodium coolant from the EBR-II. ANL and the INEEL serve as the Nuclear Reactor Technology Lead Laboratories. These Lead Laboratories assist and work with the Department's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology to maintain and apply world class technical capabilities to assure that the Department is maximizing its investment in nuclear reactor technology research and development. This effort will focus principally on research and development activities that addresses long-term nuclear reactor technology issues such as reducing the cost of nuclear-generated electricity, finding better ways to deal with spent fuel and proliferation issues, improving the performance of existing plants, and achieving even higher levels of safety than has been achieved thus far. Brookhaven National Laboratory Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is a U.S. Department of Energy (the Department) scientific research laboratory located on Long Island, New York. The Brookhaven Linear Isotope Producer (BLIP) at BNL uses a linear accelerator that injects 200 million-electron-volt protons into the 33 giga electron-volt Alternating Gradient Synchrotron. The BLIP facility operates about 20 weeks per year and produces radioisotopes such as strontium-82, germanium-68, copper-67, and others that are used in medical diagnostic applications. BNL is also active in the development of new isotope processes and delivery systems. An initial conceptual design report to acquire and install a new 70MeV cyclotron facility at BNL was completed in April 2000. The facility would be used as a resource for research and development of isotope and related medical and scientific applications. This facility would provide reliable production of accelerator isotopes year round without interruption from other programs. In addition, it will serve as a much-needed national resource for the education and training of future radiochemists and radiopharmaceutical scientists. Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) will assume Lead Program Secretarial (LPSO) responsibility for the Idaho Operations Office (ID). As the LPSO, NE will be responsible for providing guidance and direction to the field office; reviewing contracting decisions made by the field office; ensuring adequacy of field office resources; and resolving disputes involving the field office and other Secretarial Officers. NE will have responsibility for the institutional health and long-term planning at assigned sites, for landlord activities, and has accountability for overall site integration and operations. NE will also have overall line accountability for site-wide environment, safety and health, safeguards and security, and implementation of policy promulgated by headquarters staff and support functions. With the transfer of INEEL from EM to NE, INEEL will become the ""command center"" for NE's strategic nuclear energy research and development enterprise, INEEL's revised mission will play a major role in Generation IV nuclear energy systems development, advanced fuel cycle development, and space nuclear power and propulsion applications. The INEEL will transition its research and development focus from environmental programs to nuclear energy programs while maintaining its multi-program national Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 110  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   laboratory status to best serve ongoing and future DOE and national needs. While INEEL will focus on its new role as the center for nuclear research and development as a multi-program national laboratory, the INEEL will continue to pursue appropriate roles in national security, environmental and other activities. NE manages the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and other non-reactor nuclear facilities at INEEL including day-to-day oversight with responsibility for safe operations; startup authority; safety basis documentation approval; accomplishment of program missions on schedule and within budget; and protection of the workers, the public, and the environment. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, established as the National Reactor Testing Station in 1949, occupies 890 square miles in the Snake River Plain of Southeastern Idaho. Over the years, 52 reactors have been constructed and operated at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. This site is owned by DOE and as of October 1999, is managed by Bechtel, Babcock and Wilcox Inc. There are nine primary facilities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory as well as administrative, engineering, and research laboratories in Idaho Falls, approximately 50 miles east of the site. Other activities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory over the last five decades include nuclear technology research, defense programs, engineering testing and operations, as well as ongoing projects to develop, demonstrate, and transfer of advanced engineering technology and systems to private industry. The Idaho Test Reactor Area (TRA) is located within the INEEL. Since the early 1950s, test reactors, laboratories, hot cells and supporting facilities have been built at TRA. The principal facility operating at TRA is the ATR. The ATR is one of the world's largest and most advanced test reactors. It currently provides vital irradiation testing for reactor fuels and core components, primarily for the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program. The ATR can also produce isotopes critically needed by medicine and industry. The 250-megawatt ATR has nine major locations where independent loops can be used for experimental irradiation work and numerous drop-in locations for experiments and isotope production throughout the core region. The ATR is unique in being able to adjust the local power and neutron flux within the core. This provides unusual flexibility in meeting test sponsor and isotope production needs. The ATR is currently not producing isotopes, but isotope production is anticipated to resume in FY 2003. The three most important isotopes normally produced in the ATR are: iridium-192, used in industrial radiography and radiation oncology for tumor therapy; cobalt-60, used in food sterilization and cancer treatment; and nickel-63 used in direct conversion power sources. Other facilities currently operating on the site are: the ATR Critical Facility reactor, which supports ATR operations; the TRA Hot Cells; the Office of Science's Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) Facility, which does fusion fuel research and has been designated by the Secretary of Energy as a National User Facility; and the INEEL Applied Engineering and Development Laboratory. ATR operations and a wide variety of scientific research projects are planned to continue at TRA until well into the twenty-first century. The following facilities at TRA are shutdown in a surveillance and maintenance status awaiting decontamination and decommissioning: the Materials Test Reactor (MTR), the MTR Canal, the Engineering Test Reactor, the Coupled Fast Reactivity Measurement Facility, and the Advanced Reactivity Measurement Facility. The INEEL Infrastructure account provides for maintaining and upgrading TRA common use facilities and the utility infrastructure to ensure that programmatic, reliability and ES&H requirements are met.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 111  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   The INEEL and the ANL serve as the Nuclear Reactor Technology Lead Laboratories. They are essential to meeting the goals of the National Energy Policy. These Lead Laboratories assist and work with the Department's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology to maintain and apply world class technical capabilities to assure that the Department is maximizing its investment in nuclear reactor technology research and development. This effort will focus principally on research and development activities that addresses long-term nuclear reactor technology issues such as reducing the cost of nuclear-generated electricity, finding better ways to deal with spent fuel and proliferation issues, improving the performance of existing plants, and achieving even higher levels of safety than has been achieved thus far. Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a U.S. Department of Energy scientific research laboratory located in New Mexico. A portion of the Plutonium Facility-4 at the Technical Area-55 at LANL is dedicated to Pu-238 processing. This capability is the only existing Pu-238 processing and encapsulation capability within the DOE complex and is used to process and encapsulate Pu-238 used in radioisotope power sources for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space exploration missions and national security applications. The LANL capabilities were expanded to include establishing a Pu-238 scrap recovery capability to recycle Pu-238 scrap for use in future missions. In FY 2002, LANL technical expertise was also used in analyzing the reactor core aspects of fission power concepts that may be required to satisfy future higher power space applications. However, this DOE funded activity will be phased out in FY 2003. Related space reactor technology efforts will continue in FY 2003 and FY 2004 using user agency funding. Once in operation, after completion of the construction in FY 2003, the new 100 MeV Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at LANL will use the proton beam of the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Linear Accelerator. The IPF may operate up to 8 months per year in conjunction with other programs. This will be an increase in operating time of 20 weeks from FY 1999. The unique characteristics of the LANSCE accelerator include a high-energy, high-current beam that allows production of higher quality radioisotopes, as well as exotic radioisotopes that cannot be produced in other facilities. Three major products produced at the site are germanium-68, a calibration source for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners; strontium-82, the parent of rubidium-82, used in cardiac PET imaging; and sodium-22, a positron-emitter used in neurological research. Mound, Ohio Plant The Mound Plant is located in southwest Ohio adjacent to the city of Miamisburg. Previously, the main mission of the Mound, Ohio Plant was to manufacture components for nuclear weapons for Defense Programs. As part of the Department's Non-nuclear Consolidation Plan, the Department decided to consolidate Defense Program activities to other sites and transferred the Mound, Ohio Plant site to the Office of Environmental Management for cleanup and transition of the facilities and properties to commercial operations. The Department had planned to maintain the radioisotope power system assembly and test operations at the Mound site. However, security issues subsequent to the events of September 11, 2002, obligated the Department to reconsider whether these operations should remain at Mound or be transferred to another site. After completing an Environmental Assessment and cost evaluations of a range of alternative actions, a decision was made to transfer the radioisotope power system heat source and assembly and test operations from Mound to ANL-W. Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 112  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Oak Ridge National Laboratory The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a U.S. Department of Energy scientific research laboratory located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORNL has developed the unique capabilities for fabricating carbon insulator and iridium heat sources components for radioisotope power sources used for NASA space exploration missions. These sophisticated heat source components are necessary for the safe operation of these power systems during normal operation and during launch, reentry or other deployment accidents. In FY 2001 and FY 2002, ORNL has also been the site for doing the target assembly and the processing of irradiated targets associated with the potential establishment of a domestic Pu-238 production capability. Targets were irradiated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) located at ORNL and the Advanced Test Reactor in Idaho. ORNL is preparing to receive and store the Np-237 inventory currently stored at Savannah River. Technical reactor expertise was also used at ORNL in FY 2002 to independently evaluate and assess potential space fission power and propulsion concepts and technologies proposed to meet the higher power requirements that may be needed to satisfy future space missions. NE manages the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and other non-reactor nuclear facilities at ORNL including day-to-day oversight with responsibility for safe operations; startup authority; safety basis documentation approval; accomplishment of program missions on schedule and within budget; and protection of the workers, the public, and the environment. The HFIR at ORNL provides one of the world's highest steady-state neutron fluxes. The reactor is normally scheduled to operate about 43 weeks per year to support primary missions other than isotope production. Isotope products made at this facility include tungsten-188, rhenium-186, californium-252, and iridium-192. One target position, with hydraulic capability to simultaneously load and unload up to eight targets is available and is heavily used for medical radioisotope production. Additional peripheral target positions became available in the second half of FY 1999. The program depends heavily on HFIR for isotope production. The program also maintains the Hot Cell Facility, Building 3047, at ORNL to process and package the radioisotopes produced at the HFIR. In addition, one of the cells in Building 3047 is being modified to accommodate processing alpha isotopes to meet future demand. Currently, the electromagnetic calutrons at ORNL have been placed in a cold-standby mode with minimum maintenance. The calutrons will be shut down and transferred to the Department's Environmental Management Program for disposition. Within the calutron building, ORNL operates two laboratories used for processing and forming enriched stable isotopes: the material laboratory performs a wide variety of metallurgical, ceramic, and high vacuum processing techniques; the chemical laboratory performs scraping, leaching, dissolving, oxidizing processes to remove unwanted materials and place the isotope into a ""chemically stable"" form. These laboratories and the stable isotope inventories will be transferred to site area X-10 at Oak Ridge. Additionally, the ORNL Building 3019. Storage Building 3019 was built inspected in over twenty is storing 1.5 metric tons of uranium, containing 450 kilograms of U-233, in of this material presents several safety issues due in part to the fact that during the Manhattan Project and that the storage containers have not been years. The Uranium-233 Disposition, Medical Isotope Production, and FY 2004 Congressional Budget Page 113  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure   Building 3019 Complex Shutdown Preliminary Project (U-233 Project) will resolve these safety issues while increasing the availability of medically valuable isotopes that will be extracted from the U-233 during processing. The down-blending of U-233 will reduce the global nuclear danger by making this material unsuitable for use in weapons. No new funds are requested in FY 2004 for this activity, however, this request reflects the transfer of funds related to activities at Building 3019 from the Office of Defense Program. Sandia National Laboratories Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is a U.S. Department of Energy scientific research laboratory located in New Mexico. NE manages the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) and other nonreactor nuclear facilities at SNL including day-to-day oversight with responsibility for safe operations; startup authority; safety basis documentation approval; accomplishment of program missions on schedule and within budget; and protection of the workers, the public, and the environment. SNL has unique analytical and testing capability used to evaluate radioisotope power system response during hypothetical launch accidents. These capabilities are used on an as required basis to support preparation of Safety Analysis Reports. In FY 2002, Sandia technical expertise was also used in defining overall system concepts involving space fission energy systems that may be required to satisfy higher power space applications. However, this activity will be phased out in FY 2003. SNL's ACRR is a 2megawatt, pool-type research reactor that with the capability to produce isotopes for medical applications. The ACRR is a highly flexible facility applied to the mission requirements of the Department in both isotope and national security applications. National security programs use the ACRR's short duration high-power pulse capabilities for component testing.  Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/ Infrastructure Page 114  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Radiological Facilities Management Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives The mission of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology's (NE's) Radiological Facilities Management program is to maintain critical user facilities in a safe, secure, environmentally-compliant and cost-effective manner to support national priorities. The Radiological Facilities Management program funds the management of the Department's vital resources and capabilities at NE-managed facilities at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Sandia National Laboratory (SNL), and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). These funds assure that NE facilities meet essential safety and environmental requirements, as well as assuring that various NE-managed facilities are maintained at user ready levels. Operations, production, research, and other additional activities are funded by DOE, industrial, research, and other Federal agency users. In FY 2004, the facilities and infrastructure activities previously funded in the Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems and Medical Isotope program have been included in the Radiological Facilities Management program. In addition, the titles of these programs have been changed to Space and Defense Infrastructure and the Medical Isotope Infrastructure. These changes more accurately reflect the activities being performed at NE managed sites and facilities. The mission of the Radiological Facilities Management program is to maintain the Department's nuclear research and production facilities in a user-ready status to support vital U.S. Government missions. In addition, the Radiological Facilities Management program has been maintaining the heat source and power system assembly and testing facilities at the Mound, Ohio Plant for radioisotope power systems. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the Department identified the need to enhance security at the Mound Site or to transfer operations to another site where security was already in place. The components and systems at Mound containing Pu-238 were transferred to ANL-W on an interim basis for safe and secure storage pending a final decision. After completing an Environmental Assessment and cost evaluations of a range of alternative actions, the Department decided to permanently locate the operations at ANL-W as the most cost-effective alternative. The transfer of certain equipment should be completed in FY 2003 with some capabilities operational by mid FY 2004 and the full capability in place during FY 2005. At ORNL, the Radiological Facilities Management program maintains the unique infrastructure for iridium fabrication. Iridium is the cladding used to encapsulate Pu-238 for use in space and national security missions and ORNL maintains the only unique U.S. capability to process and fabricate iridium into the necessary cladding configuration. In addition, ORNL is preparing to receive and store the Np237 inventory currently stored at Savannah River. This Np-237 is the required target material to establish a domestic capability to produce Pu-238. At ORNL, the program maintains Building 3047 Hot Cells in a safe and environmentally compliant condition and state of readiness for the production, packaging, and shipment of radioisotopes used in medicine, homeland security applications, and other scientific research. The Chemical and Materials Energy Supply/Nuclear Energy/Infrastructure/ Radiological Facilities Management Page 115  FY 2004 Congressional Budget   Laboratories in Building 9204-3 are used for stable isotope processing. Stable isotopes are used as feed material for radioisotopes and in medical and scientific research. Additionally, the ORNL is storing 1.5 metric tons of uranium, containing 450 kilograms of U-233, in Building 3019. Storage of this material presents several safety issues due in part to the fact that Building 3019 was built during the Manhattan Project and that the storage containers have not been inspected in over twenty years. The Uranium-233 Disposition, Medical Isotope Production, and Building 3019 Complex Shutdown Preliminary Project (U-233 Project) will resolve these safety issues while increasing the availability of medically valuable isotopes that will be extracted from the U-233 during processing. The down-blending of U-233 will reduce the global nuclear danger by making this material unsuitable for use in weapons. No new funds are requested in FY 2004 for this activity, however, this request reflects the transfer of funds related to activities at Building 3019 from the Office of Defense Program. At LANL, this program maintains the Pu-238 encapsulation and scrap recovery facilities in the Plutonium Facility (designated PF-4) in Technical Area-55. These facilities provide the capability to process, pelletize and encapsulate the Pu-238 so that it can be safety transported and used in radioisotope power systems. In addition, the Radiological Facilities Management program maintains the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) and associated hot cells at SNL; and the Brookhaven Linear Isotope Producer (BLIP) Building 931 and Hot Cell Building 801 which is used for isotope processing at BNL. Also, a conceptual design report has been developed for a dedicated isotope production 70 MeV cyclotron at BNL. In conjunction with the LANL Isotope Production Facility, the 70 MeV cyclotron at BNL could provide for continued year-round production of vital research isotopes. Currently, BLIP utilizes the excess beam of a linear accelerator that injects 200 million electron volt protons into the 33 gigaelectron volt Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). The AGS future is uncertain because of lack of funding and a reduced mission. If the AGS does not accelerate protons in FY 2004, the BLIP would become prohibitively expensive to operate. The proposed cyclotron would replace the BLIP and provide capacity to meet future U.S. medical research isotope production requirements. It would also serve as a training facility for the next generation of nuclear/radiochemists. The FY 2004 budget request continues pre-conceptual design activities for the cyclotron. The FY 2004 budget requests funding to manage the Department's vital resources and capabilities at ANL-W, ORNL, LANL, SNL, BNL, and Mound to ensure that DOE missions can be met in a safe, environmentally-compliant and cost effective manner.

In FY 2002, based upon an environmental assessment, a cost evaluation, and safeguard and security considerations, a decision was made to transfer these operations from Mound to ANL-W. The transfer efforts were initiated in late FY 2002 with the movement of any radioactive materials. During FY 2003, the transfer of critical equipment that is to be moved from Mound will be completed and efforts will begin on the design of new equipment and required facility modifications. The new equipment and facility designs will be completed during FY 2004 and the procurement of equipment and the actual facility modifications will begin. The goal is to have capabilities that could support a critical national security application operational by mid FY 2004 with the full capability reestablished by early FY 2005. The increase of $2,800,000 is required to support the design efforts, to initiate preparation of operating procedures and to obtain the capability to perform operational and analytical reviews.

In FY 2002, the full-scale scrap recovery line was scheduled for full operational status. This line should be in full operation by FY 2003. In FY 2003 and 2004, the Pu-238 processing and encapsulation facilities to produce encapsulated pellets will also be in full operation. In FY 2004, performance will be measured by fabricating at least eight encapsulated Pu-238 fuel pellets and by processing at least 3 kilograms of Pu-238 through the scrap recovery facilities.

GX255-57-1929429	"DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FY 2003 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET REQUEST ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY ENERGY CONSERVATION (Tabular Dollars in Thousands, Narrative in Whole Dollars) TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PROGRAM MISSION  Mission: The Transportation Program partners with industry, research organizations, State governments, and other Federal agencies to support development and use of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels which reduce demand for petroleum, decrease emissions of criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and enable the U.S. transportation industry to sustain a strong, competitive position in domestic and world markets. Strategic Context : The transportation sector consumed 27 percent of the nation's energy in 2001. Petroleum is the Transportation Petroleum Gap primary fuel source in this sector, accounting for 95 percent of the fuel consumed. While there have been many 20 improvements in vehicle/engine fuel efficiency, transportation fuel consumption continues to increase due to Transportation Oil Use 15 the rise in the number of drivers and miles traveled, as well as the demand for larger vehicles and lower fuel-economy 10 vans, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles. The Domestic Oil Production 5 transportation of persons and goods demands 67 percent of this nation's oil consumption. Our increasing transportation 0 requirements have helped create a daily imported oil 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 demand of 10 million barrels, or 52 percent of the country's petroleum consumption. The Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) is projecting 1.9 percent annual growth in transportation energy use through 2020. At the present time, the United States consumes 26 percent of the world's oil while producing 12 percent of the total global supply. Considering the distribution of known world conventional oil reserves, the U.S. has only 2 percent while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) currently account for 79 percent.  Million Barrels per Day  2020   Some of the major market barriers which new transportation technology and fuels must overcome are: low consumer priority on fuel economy; significant business investment required for advanced vehicle technologies and alternative fuels; lack of alternative fuel infrastructure; and strong competition among fuel alternatives for a relatively small market. Strategic Approach: The Administration's National Energy Policy (May 2001) describes the need for a Federal role to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Office of Transportation Technologies supports the National Energy Policy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's (EERE) strategic goals by conducting long-term research, development, and deployment programs which will enable reduced oil consumption. This reduction will be accomplished by achieving: 1) significant improvements in vehicle fuel economy; and 2) displacement of oil by other fuels which are domestic, clean, and cost-competitive. This investment focuses on areas that would not be pursued by industry alone due to high risk and uncertain outcomes. Transportation technologies work is primarily focused on research and development of advanced technologies, with priorities established in conjunction with cost-sharing partners, primarily industry. The work is accomplished by numerous organizations, including industry, government and university laboratories, and strong public/private partnerships with the automotive and truck industries. Initiatives in such areas as incentives, information, and education are also essential if advanced transportation technologies are to achieve market share sufficient to provide significant oil reduction benefits during the next 15 to 20 years. Indicative of the long-range vision behind our research and development activities is the recently announced new cooperative public/private research partnership, entitled FreedomCAR, with the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR). The new partnership supercedes and builds upon the successes of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) that began in 1993. It is, however, different in scope and breadth. FreedomCAR shifts government research to more fundamental, higher risk activities, with applicability to multiple passenger vehicle models and special emphasis on development of fuel cells and hydrogen fuel infrastructure. By sharing R&D costs and risks, the Transportation program is successfully stimulating both evolutionary and breakthrough technologies and processes. The transportation program assists industry through a variety of high-risk research and development activities, and provides a neutral, third-party platform to help competitors, suppliers, and government organizations reach consensus on program directions and plans.   GPRA: The projected annual benefits of the Transportation program, without any policy changes (and excluding biofuels benefits), are summarized in the table below. 2005 Petroleum Displaced (Million Barrels per Day) Total Primary Energy Displaced (Trillion Btu) Energy Costs or Savings (Millions of $) Carbon Equivalent Emissions Displaced (MMTCe) 0.13 27 890 2.0 2010 0.40 515 8,070 11.2 2020 2.09 3,705 45,060 73.8  Note: Program benefit projections are developed through an impact analysis process undertaken annually by EERE, based on assumptions for future energy markets derived from EIA's annual energy outlook. EERE's sectors analyze the impacts their programs will have on energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon reductions if all program goals are met, and future energy markets develop as expected. A sample of program benefit estimates are externally reviewed by Arthur D. Little. An integrated analysis model run by an external contractor controls for interaction effects across programs and sectors. At the sector level, we report a range of estimates that correspond to two modeling cases: with and without program interactions. For example, reductions in new electricity generation requirements due to energy efficiency improvements would reduce the potential market for a range of electricity supply options. When integrated and non-integrated estimates are virtually the same, no estimate range is shown .   Program Strategic Performance Goals The following Program Strategic Performance Goals (PSPG) have been established for the Transportation Program: ER1-10: Hybrid Systems R&D Hybrid Systems R&D activities will reduce the production cost of a high power 25kW battery from $3,000 in 1998 to $500 in 2010, with an intermediate goal of $750 in 2006. ER1-11: Fuel Cells R&D Fuel Cell R&D activities will reduce the production cost of the 50 kW vehicle fuel cell power system from $275/kW in 2002 to $125/kW in 2005 and $45/kW in 2010. ER1-12: Advanced Combustion Engine R&D Advanced Combustion Engine R&D activities will reduce NOx emissions in light-duty diesel vehicles from 0.10 grams per mile (g/m) in 1998 to 0.05 g/m in 2006 and 0.03 g/m in 2010 and in heavy duty diesel engines from 4.0 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr) in 1998 to 2.4 g/bhp-hr in 2002 and 0.2 g/bhp-hr in 2005. ER1-13: Electric Vehicles R&D Electric Vehicles R&D activities will reduce the production cost of a 40kWh lithium ion battery from $365/kWh in 2001 to $295/kWh in 2004 and to $150/kWh in 2010. ER1-14: Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D activities will reduce the parasitic losses, including aerodynamic drag from 39 percent in 1998 to 24 percent in 2006. ER1-15: Fuels Utilization Fuel Utilization R&D activities will decrease light truck and passenger vehicle engine-out emissions of particulate matter from 0.1 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr) in 2001 to 0.06 g/bhp-hr by 2008. ER1-16: Transportation Materials Technologies Transportation Materials Technologies R&D activities will reduce the production cost of carbon fiber from $12 per pound in 1998, to $3 per pound in 2006.   ER1-17: Transportation Technology Assistance The Clean Cities program will increase the number of alternative fuel vehicles in the Clean Cities from 110,000 in 2001, to 250,000 in 2007 and to 400,000 in 2010; helping to create successful niche markets that will yield nationwide 1,000,000 alternative fuel vehicles, consuming 1 billion gallons of alternative fuel in 2010.  Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts The following were significant accomplishments in the Transportation program during FY 2001:     Demonstrated the Digital Functional Vehicle analytical tool, which will be used to quantify the benefits of optimizing the designs of various components. Completed component selection and system design definitions for natural gas heavy hybrid vehicles. Fabricated two 276-volt lithium ion mini-battery packs with thermal and electrical controls. Completed test and evaluation of a fuel-flexible 50 kW integrated fuel cell power system that was 32 percent efficient at 1/4 peak power. This 50kW power system, developed by UTC Fuel Cells, was the world's first fully functional, automotive fuel cell system which operated on gasoline with extremely low emissions. It also indicated the development areas needed for creating a more compact/lightweight, fully integrated, and cost-competitive system. Completed planning of Focal Project 3, focused on a predominantly carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix composite, hybrid-material (i.e., some additional materials like steel and aluminum are used sparingly when necessary) vehicle ""body-in-white."" Completed explorations of four approaches to lower-cost precursors for carbon fibers; downselected and initiated further work on two most promising approaches. Demonstrated ceramic particulate filter system for engines that removes 90 percent of particulates with 90 percent filter regeneration efficiency. Achieved 50 percent reduction of friction in a variable displacement compressor/expander utilizing carbon/carbon composite and anodized aluminum contact pairs. Supported the annual acquisition of 10,000 alternative fuel vehicles in the Federal Fleet. Funded 54 projects in 25 States with $3.8 million, through the State Energy Program, leveraging over $20 million of non-Federal funds. Developed data collection protocols and initiated testing program for light-duty hybrid electric vehicles and neighborhood electric vehicles. The winning university in the FutureTruck competition achieved 40 percent improvement in fuel economy for a large sport utility vehicle (SUV).            The following are proposed significant program shifts in the Transportation program for FY 2003:           The new cooperative public/private research partnership, entitled FreedomCAR, supercedes and builds upon the successes of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Accelerate research and development of vehicle fuel cell technologies. Reduce funding for diesel emission control technologies. Reduce support for battery research and development accomplished in conjunction with the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium. Current heavy vehicle efforts are now emphasizing vehicle systems technologies alongside the more mature engine and fuels activities. The Light Truck Engine program will be coming to completion in 2004. The emphasis is shifting to improving the efficiency and reducing the emissions from the Heavy Truck Engine. Increase Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D to accelerate aerodynamic improvements. Close out activities relevant to heavy-duty natural gas vehicles and infrastructure. Reduce funding for lightweight materials development. Reduce Special Project State Grants.   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY FY 2003 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET REQUEST ENERGY CONSERVATION (Dollars in Thousands) TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PROGRAM FUNDING PROFILE  Program Activity Vehicle Technologies R&D ...................

Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives Mission: The Vehicle Technologies Research and Development (R&D) sub-program supports work on advanced vehicle technologies that will produce dramatic improvements in fuel economy for automobiles, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and light and heavy trucks, without sacrificing safety, environmental performance, and affordability. Summary: The Vehicle Technologies R&D sub-program comprises six areas that are focused on enabling high-fuel-efficiency and lowemissions advanced vehicles. The areas of research include Hybrid Systems R&D, Fuel Cell R&D, Advanced Combustion Engine R&D, Electric Vehicle R&D (high-energy batteries), Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D, and programs for small businesses and universities called CARAT (Cooperative Automotive Research for Advanced Technologies) and GATE (Graduate Automotive Technology Education), respectively. All six activities are focused on advancing enabling technologies and eliminating the barriers to commercialization. The Hybrid Systems R&D activity includes research in high power energy storage, advanced power electronics, ancillaries, and propulsion technology. Hybrid Systems R&D is overarching in that it sets performance targets for all vehicle technology areas and validates achievement of those targets in a systems context. The key research and development areas for the automotive Fuel Cell R&D activity are the fuel cell stack subsystem, the on-board fuel processing and storage subsystem, the balance-of-plant components (compressors, humidifiers, heat exchangers, sensors, controls), and the fuel infrastructure (off-board fuel processing, purification and dispensing). Performance improvements in the stack are necessary to achieve the size, weight, and cost targets required for commercialization. To provide fuel for the stack, advanced fuel-flexible fuel processors with rapid start-up and full load-following capability are being developed. Balance-of-plant components R&D is needed for the unique fuel cell requirements of flow rate, pressure, efficiency, turn-down characteristics, automotive durability, and cost. In addition, the activity is evaluating the use of petroleum, natural gas, and alternative fuels to produce hydrogen on-board and off-board the vehicle, while economical renewable sources for hydrogen are being developed. These activities are closely coordinated with DOE/EERE's Hydrogen Program.   The Advanced Combustion Engine R&D activity encompasses research on improved engine and related technologies in these primary areas: combustion and emissions controls R&D, light-truck engine R&D, heavy-truck engine R&D, and off-highway heavy vehicles. These activities are focused on improving engine efficiencies and on reducing regulated emissions through better engine performance, in combination with technologies such as emission controls (e.g., catalysts and particulate traps). The potential health impacts of exhaust emissions will be evaluated. The Electric Vehicle R&D activity is focused on developing lithium-based technologies to enable 200 mile range electric vehicles. Current vehicle range is still limited by battery performance and life, and battery cost remains high. The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), under a cost-shared Cooperative Agreement with DOE, continues to work on lithium-based batteries, with goals that will extend the range of electric vehicles by a factor of four when compared to lead-acid. The USABC has selected two types of lithium-based batteries for further research and development: lithium ion and lithium-polymer. This work is supported by national laboratories and universities funded directly by DOE. Exploratory work on new low-cost electrodes and electrolytes is conducted by the national laboratories and university researchers under Exploratory Technology Research. The Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D activity seeks to develop, in collaboration with truck manufacturers and their suppliers, technologies that will reduce non-engine parasitic energy losses from aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, friction and wear, underhood thermal conditions, and accessory loads, as well as ensure powertrain and truck system integration to increase overall vehicle system energy utilization and efficiency. Performance of the truck as an integrated system can be optimized and substantial overall energy efficiency improvement can be achieved through systematic reduction of these parasitic energy losses. The focus is on improving the fuel economy of Class 7 and 8 long-haul tractortrailers from 6.6 mpg to 10.3 mpg. Context: The Vehicle Technologies R&D sub-program achieves its mission through a balanced portfolio of research and development aimed at efficiency improvements for vehicle technologies. Projects focus on research and development program successes that can be translated by industry into vehicles rolling off the assembly lines. The sub-program organization also facilitates supplier-customer relationships to ensure that R&D results from federally sponsored laboratories are transferred to industry suppliers, and that industry supplier developments are made available to the domestic automakers. DOE=s initiatives have helped accelerate the introduction of hybrid vehicles and enabling technologies. The sub-program was instrumental in stimulating the auto industry, worldwide, to initiate in-house efforts to develop and demonstrate hybrid vehicles. The Japanese auto companies were first to market small numbers of these vehicles in the U.S. in 2000, notably the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight. Other announcements to market hybrid vehicles in 2003 and 2004 in high-volume segments came from the U.S. automotive industry recently pertaining to the DaimlerChrysler hybrid Durango SUV, Ford Escape hybrid SUV, and General Motors Silverado and GMC Sierra. In addition, the program=s partnership with industry has demonstrated concept vehicles with improvements in fuel efficiency of up to three times over conventional vehicles. Prior to this program, hybrid vehicles were thought to be too expensive and not feasible. The program continues to push the technology envelope to help realize the potential benefits in improved fuel economy and reduced emissions, as well as   to develop a U.S. supplier base. Examples of the impact on industry and moving these technologies closer to commercialization follow: As a result of the groundwork laid through the DOE transportation fuel cell activity, a U.S. industry base for fuel cells has been built. Companies such as Plug Power and NUVERA exist primarily because of early DOE support. Other, larger U.S. companies such as 3M, International Fuel Cells (now UTC Fuel Cells), and Honeywell have instituted polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) programs primarily because of DOE support. A number of mergers, and the formation of several spin-off companies that plan to commercialize fuel cell technology, have also occurred. In 1992, DOE funded Arthur D. Little (ADL) to perform a fuel chain analysis and identify appropriate reforming technologies for fuel cells. This work led to a fuel processing research effort at ADL funded by DOE, an area where previously there was no work. This work was successful and grew (almost exclusively funded by DOE) until ADL spun off a separate company, Epyx, to continue work. DOE continued to fund Epyx and urged it to form a partnership that involved a fuel cell stack technology company, which it did in 2000 with the formation of NUVERA, a joint venture among Amerada Hess, A.D. Little, and DeNora Fuel Cells. The role of DOE in automotive fuel cell technology R&D was cited by Harry Pearce, former Vice-Chairman of General Motors, at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2000: ""With the assistance that we=ve received from the Department of Energy, who I believe is the entity primarily responsible for bringing this technology out of the aerospace industry into the automotive industry, and with the very able assistance of the national labs, I am satisfied we=ll get there.@ The Advanced Combustion Engine activity has shown that barriers to achievement of Tier 2 emissions levels by advanced direct injection engines can be overcome. Tests at both the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at Cummins Engine Company have shown that the current research path for NOx and PM reduction is viable and has demonstrated Tier 2 levels, though not for a period long enough to be viable for use on vehicles. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is also developing an integrated nonthermal plasma (NTP) assisted catalyst and particulate filter system for reducing PM and NOx from compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engines by an average of 90 percent for PM and 80 percent for NOx. Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) has developed a Urea Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx control system that is combined with a continuously regenerating PM filter. SCR is being explored because it has shown the best conversion efficiencies to date over the widest temperature range, and is relatively sulfur tolerant. Industrial Ceramic Solutions continued its successful development of a microwave regenerated PM trap. Its researchers were able to increase PM removal to the range of 80 to 95 percent which will enable CIDI vehicles to meet the most stringent Tier 2 PM standards. The Electric Vehicle R&D goals of the mid-term technology development phase of the Department=s program with USABC were generally met. Successful completion of the nickel metal hydride mid-term battery development has resulted in the use of these batteries in commercially produced electric and hybrid electric vehicles. About 1,000 electric vehicles with nickel metal hydride batteries were put into operation in the late 1990s; thus, the technology was subjected to extensive in-use evaluation. It is expected that the transition from the use of nickel metal hydride batteries to lithium-based batteries for electric vehicles will occur in the next seven to ten years as the new technology is developed. At that point, the overall goals of the Department=s program will have been met. Currently, more than 100 electric vehicles   (manufactured by Nissan) with Shin Kobe lithium ion batteries are in operation. USABC-developed, lithium-based batteries have been integrated into prototype electric vehicles. The Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D activity works closely with key stakeholders, including truck and trailer manufacturers, engine companies, suppliers, and other industry stakeholders. For the relatively short time that the Heavy Vehicles activity has been in existence, there are several notable accomplishments that resulted from efforts on innovative ideas to improve the overall fuel efficiency of the heavy vehicle when optimized as an integrated system. Energy systems analysis identified aerodynamic drag as the dominant parasitic energy loss for heavy-duty long-haul trucks. Analysis of energy loss from truck idling and state-of-the-art assessment on heating and cooling auxiliary power units that have the potential to reduce idling of heavy-duty trucks were completed, with opportunities identified to increase effectiveness of truck engine cooling systems (radiator), enabling safety and design enhancements to the truck cab. The Vehicle Technologies R&D sub-program provides technology options that span the sub-sectors of the light and heavy vehicle markets. These technology options, when sufficiently developed, can be commercialized by industry when fuel prices and environmental imperatives warrant. The sub-program is pursuing a technology portfolio that is responsive to consumer and commercial needs for vehicles that offer enhanced functionality while also respecting the environment. The program has been very successful at partnering with stakeholders who identify opportunities for targeted technology development that can have significant impact on reducing petroleum consumption while also being cost effective. Because almost half of the 17 million passenger vehicles sold each year are light trucks, the program has shifted to focus more resources on this market segment. Also, as powerful computers and innovative software have become available, the program has increasingly invested in modeling and analysis tools to improve its capabilities to speed up evaluating new concepts and determining fuel efficiency potential before committing to expensive hardware. When small companies have devised innovative concepts, the program has provided support as well as formed strategic partnerships to accelerate those technologies to market. The program has also provided engineering data and important research findings to sister agencies that proved to be vital in fuel, emissions, and fuel-economy related regulatory activity. The program will continue to be in tune with changes in the light and heavy vehicle markets and to take advantage of opportunities for leveraging government resources. Management Strategy: The Vehicle Technologies' activities, except for the CARAT and Heavy Hybrid Vehicles R&D activities, are organized in cooperation with the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), to provide a mechanism for developing requirements, industry consensus, and recommendations for program direction through the implementation of technical teams. These teams are composed of government and industry experts that meet on a periodic basis to review and provide guidance on projects. DOE anticipates that some technical teams may change as the research shifts focus during the transition from PNGV to FreedomCAR. Cost-shared cooperative agreements with industry are implemented through competitive solicitations by the Department of Energy. Laboratories are directly funded,   based on their capabilities and performance. An advisory panel comprised of automotive industry experts reviews each laboratory project at the annual Merit Review and Peer Evaluation of National Laboratory R&D. Projects are evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) technical approach; 2) technical accomplishments and progress toward DOE goals; 3) technology transfer and collaborations with industry, universities, and other national laboratories; and 4) proposed future research. The panel also evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each project, as well as recommending additions to or deletions from the scope of work. The program organization facilitates supplier-customer relationships to ensure that R&D results from federally sponsored laboratories are transferred to industry suppliers and that industry supplier developments are made available to the domestic automakers. All activities conducted under the FreedomCAR partnership  including vehicle technologies activities  will be reviewed biennially by the National Research Council. The figure below illustrates the management structure and responsibilities of the major groups participating in the FreedomCAR programs.  The different management structures used in CARAT, Electric Vehicle R&D, and Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D are explained below. Cooperative Automotive Research for Advanced Technology (CARAT): This activity has two elements: CARAT and Graduate Automotive Technology Education (GATE). Under CARAT, the objective is to include the innovative ideas and technologies of small businesses and institutions of higher learning in DOE's advanced automotive technologies programs. This is accomplished through regular competitive solicitations of proposals to conduct cost-shared research and development. The topic areas cover the spectrum of automotive technologies that   have potential for improving efficiency. Industry partners provide input on priorities for topic selection. The evaluations of applications are completed by outside expert reviewers, and a consensus meeting is held among the Office of Advanced Automotive Technologies (OAAT) technology managers to determine which projects will be awarded. The types of projects selected must complement the existing research and often fill gaps in the existing programs. Once the projects are underway or near completion, the results are presented at an industry review meeting (for example, Government/Industry Partnership Fuel Cell Technical Team monthly meeting, USABC program review, Automotive Composites Consortium meeting, annual Vehicle Systems Merit Review and Peer Evaluation of National Laboratory R&D, etc.), during which participants provide feedback on the merit of the work, and whether further support is recommended. The objective of the GATE program is to train a future workforce of automotive engineers who are knowledgeable about advanced technologies, and also to utilize the brightest university graduate students to help solve current technical challenges. This is accomplished by setting up GATE Centers of Excellence, establishing focused curriculum, and providing funds for research fellowships. The original ten GATE schools were selected through a competitive solicitation. An annual GATE Forum is held with representatives from industry, universities, and government agencies to increase partnering opportunities and present the research on enabling technologies being developed at the GATE centers. These research projects are evaluated for merit by the participants with formal feedback provided to the presenters. Electric Vehicles R&D: The Electric Vehicles R&D activity has two elements: Advanced Battery Development and Exploratory Technology Research. Under Advanced Battery Development, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) conducts R&D on advanced proprietary battery technologies by contracting with industrial developers, with support from the DOE national laboratories. Exploratory Technology Research, focused on developing new electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced batteries, is conducted at the national laboratories. All of the USABC subcontracts to develop advanced batteries for electric vehicles have been awarded under a competitive process established by the USABC. All program participants regularly make measurements or estimate critical parameters of program progress in accordance with standardized procedures and processes. Deliverables by the industrial contractors to the USABC are independently evaluated by the DOE national laboratories. The Electric Vehicles R&D activity is reviewed by Transportation technologies and OAAT every four months, during which progress toward the battery technical targets and fiscal year milestones is evaluated. Similarly, all industrial and laboratory R&D activities are reviewed every three months by DOE and the USABC, with progress being assessed against the established metrics and milestones. Merit Reviews are conducted annually by DOE. Interagency coordination on advanced battery development is conducted through the governmentsponsored Interagency Advanced Power Group. Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D: DOE's goals and planning for the Heavy Vehicle Systems activity have been substantially augmented by workshops involving representatives from government, industry, and academia, which have resulted in the formulation of peer-group reviewed Multi-Year Program Plans (MYPPs). The MYPPs have identified the key technical thrust areas, technical barriers, potential market barriers,   time frames for development, and estimated resources required to achieve the identified goals. Truck original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), engine manufacturers, material suppliers, and key component manufacturers have been actively involved in the review, approval, and acceptance of the MYPPs, the subsequent research activities, and the evaluation and commercial implementation of the technical developments of the program. The national laboratories, particularly LLNL, ANL, and ORNL, provide key technical support for the R&D project activities with industry, many of which are selected through competitive solicitations. The DOE program manager retains the sole responsibility for making the final decisions in the selection of the projects within the programmatic portfolio. A. Hybrid Systems R&D Long Term Goals and Benefits The goals of the Hybrid Systems R&D activity are to develop advanced propulsion and ancillary subsystem components (e.g., high-power energy storage, power electronics, electric machines), consistent with established performance targets. The activity also sets performance targets for component development programs and validates the achievement of vehicle-level objectives through a combination of component and vehicle testing and computer simulation. All activities are system-driven and barrier-focused, to ensure maximum benefit from the R&D investment and development of hybrid systems technologies that are practical for automobile, light trucks and heavy vehicle applications. All technological targets for hybrid system technologies are derived from a common vehicle-level perspective, and the resultant technologies are validated in the context of a vehicle operating environment. Additionally, resources are being refocused on longer term R&D applicable to a broader range of clean and efficient vehicles to give the industry greater flexibility in harvesting the benefits from these new technologies. GPRA: The projected benefits of the Hybrid Systems R&D activity are shown in the table below.   Hybrid Systems R&D Petroleum Displaced (Millions Barrels per Day) Total Primary Energy Displaced (Trillion Btu) Energy Costs or Savings (Millions of $) Carbon Equivalent Emissions Displaced (MMTCE)  2005 0.01 10 105 0.19  2010 0.09 182 1,991 3.53  2020 0.71 1,499 16,005 29.02  Note: Program benefit projections are developed through an impact analysis process undertaken annually by EERE, based on assumptions for future energy markets derived from EIA's annual energy outlook.

Performance Indicator: The estimated cost of high power 25 kW batteries will be the indicator of performance for the hybrid systems R&D activity. This will be measured as the cost per 25kW battery system, at a production level of 100,000 battery systems per year. Annual Performance Results and Targets FY 2001 Results Completed testing of the 276-volt battery aimed at demonstrating an integrated system having thermal and electrical controls. (ER3-1) Significant Accomplishments The Hybrid Systems R&D activity develops the propulsion system components that are vital to the widespread commercialization of hybrid vehicles in light and heavy vehicles. The program has been very successful in creating the analytical tools and instruments that enable advanced vehicles to be simulated and evaluated without having to build hardware. This capability will be a valuable asset as the program moves forward. In addition, progress has been made in development of high-power battery and electric drive technologies for use in hybrid electric vehicles. FY 2001.

Fuel Cell R&D The use of fuel cell vehicles has the potential to significantly reduce harmful emissions and consumption of non-renewable energy sources. The fuel cell is a revolutionary technology that can power automobiles with little or no tailpipe emissions, provide energy to homes and factories with virtually no smokestack pollution, and utilize renewable, domestic energy while creating thousands of jobs. Long Term Goals and Benefits The Fuel Cell R&D activity develops technologies for highly-efficient, low- or zero-emission, cost-competitive vehicle fuel cell power systems that can operate on either conventional or alternative fuels. The long-term goal is to develop fuel cell vehicles that operate on renewable-based hydrogen. The program integrates efforts of the automotive industry, fuel cell and fuel processor developers, national laboratories, universities, and fuel suppliers in a customer-focused program to develop fuel-efficient vehicle power systems that meet the most stringent emission standards while retaining the same performance as today's vehicles. The goals of the program are to develop and validate fuel cell power system technologies (including fuel cell stack subsystem, fuel processor subsystem, and balance of plant components) by the year 2010 that are:  45 percent energy efficient at 1/4 peak power; 35 percent energy efficient at peak power        capable of being manufactured with a projected high-volume cost of $45 per kilowatt (kW) in 2010 compliant with EPA Tier 2, Bin 2, emissions regulations capable of operating on hydrogen, or on hydrogen-rich fuel produced from on-board reforming of Tier 2 gasoline, methanol, ethanol, and natural gas comparable in performance, safety, and reliability to the gasoline internal combustion engine.

S S S S  By 2005, demonstrate a 50kW fuel-flexible fuel processing subsystem with power density greater than 700 W/L and specific power greater than 700 W/kg. (Year 2000 baseline performance was 500W/L and 450 W/kg. ) By 2005, demonstrate an integrated 50kW fuel cell system with 40 percent efficiency at 1/4 peak power running on gasoline. (Year 2000 baseline performance was a 10kW system that achieved 30 percent efficiency at 1/4 peak power.) By 2005, reduce the cost of a 50kW fuel cell stack subsystem to $125/kW. (Year 2000 baseline performance was $325/kW.) By 2005, reduce fuel cell stack platinum loading to 0.6g/peak kW. (Year 2000 baseline performance was 2.0g/kW.)  Program Strategic Performance Goal ER1-11: Fuel Cells R&D Fuel Cell R&D activities will reduce the production cost of the 50 kW vehicle fuel cell power system from $275/kW in 2002 to $125/kW in 2005 and $45/kW in 2010.   Fuel Cell Power System Cost (includes either a fuel processor subsystem or hydrogen storage system.)

Annual Performance Results and Targets FY 2001 Results Achieved $325/kW for a 50 kW fuel cell power system. FY 2002 Target Achieve $275/kW for a 50 kW fuel cell power system. FY 2003 Proposed Target Achieve $225/kW for a 50 kW fuel cell power system.   Significant Accomplishments The Fuel Cells for Transportation Program funds multiple component development efforts in support of the ultimate objective of industry production of automotive fuel cell power systems that are highly efficient, low or zero emission, and cost competitive. Projects have included the development of complete systems, fuel processing and stack systems, individual components, and fuel infrastructure subsystems. Specific technical targets for the complete system, subsystems and components guide these activities. FY 2001. Completed test and evaluation of a fuel-flexible 50 kW integrated fuel cell power system that was 32 percent efficient at 1/4 peak power. This 50kW power system, developed by International Fuel Cells (now UTC Fuel Cells), was the world's first fully functional, automotive fuel cell system which operated on gasoline with extremely low emissions. It also indicated the development areas needed for creating a more compact/lightweight, fully integrated, and cost-competitive system. This is a major program accomplishment toward DOE's 2010 goal of creating a high efficiency propulsion system comparable in performance to the internal combustion engine. FY 2002. Demonstration and delivery of an advanced 50 kW fuel-flexible fuel processor subsystem for automotive fuel cell systems achieving a power density of 800W/L and a specific power of 550 W/kg. Since a hydrogen infrastructure is currently unavailable, a fuel processor on-board the vehicle that can derive hydrogen from fuels such as gasoline, alcohols, or natural gas will allow fuel cell vehicles to enter the market more quickly. This could provide the fuel efficiency benefits of fuel cells sooner, thus accelerating fuel cell vehicle commercialization and hydrogen fueling infrastructure development. A major challenge is to make the on-board fuel processor compact and lightweight. FY 2003. Demonstrate feasibility of low-cost fabrication processes for membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) in pilot plant operation to meet an overall fuel cell stack subsystem cost target of $100/kW. Initiate development of advanced catalyst deposition techniques that will meet the 2005 precious metal loading target of 0.6g/kW. Accelerate research of hydrogen storage for vehicle applications. Cost is one of the main barriers to commercialization. New materials and high-volume manufacturing processes can significantly reduce costs. Support field evaluations of fuel cell research vehicles, which are necessary to determine future R&D needs and the feasibility of hydrogen refueling operations. C. Advanced Combustion Engine R&D Long Term Goals and Benefits The Advanced Combustion Engine R&D activity focuses research and development efforts on removing critical technical barriers to commercialization of higher efficiency, advanced internal combustion engines. These efforts will enable dramatic improvements to   automobile, light truck, and heavy truck fuel economy (ranging from 10 percent to 35 percent, depending on vehicle size and weight) while cost-effectively meeting projected emissions regulations. This activity encompasses research on improved engine and related technologies in three primary areas: Combustion and Emission Control, Light Truck Engine, and Heavy Truck Engine. Work supported is focused on improving engine efficiency and on reducing regulated emissions through better engine performance in combination with supporting technologies such as emission controls (e.g. NOx catalysts and particulate traps). Complementing the three primary efforts are evaluations of the potential health impacts of exhaust emissions and the development of technologies to reduce emissions from off-highway heavy vehicles. These efforts are performed in conjunction with research supported by the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels activity.

Cooperative Automotive Research for Advanced Technology (CARAT) The Cooperative Automotive Research for Advanced Technology activity consists of CARAT and Graduate Automotive Technology Education (GATE). CARAT represents an aggressive and focused effort to ensure that small businesses and universities can fully participate in advanced automotive R&D activities. GATE provides graduate-level engineering training focused on crosscutting advanced automotive technologies by providing research fellowships and support to develop technology-based curricula. Long Term Goals and Benefits The goal of CARAT is to develop the most promising ideas for energy-efficient automotive technologies from small businesses and universities. The goals for GATE are (1) to train a future workforce of engineering professionals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in developing automotive technologies critical to the design and production of future automobiles; and (2) to marshal the resources of the brightest university graduate students to help solve the technology challenges identified by government and industry. CARAT: GATE: By FY 2005, design, test and evaluate approximately 40 advanced components for potential applications in high-efficiency vehicles. By FY 2005, award fellowships to over 100 graduate students to study and conduct research on the most critical automotive technologies related to high fuel economy vehicles.  The technical objectives that the specific CARAT and GATE projects support are within each of the other Vehicle Technologies activities. (For example, one CARAT project on development of lithium ion anodes addresses the Electric Vehicle activity's objective of a 200 mile range battery by 2008). Significant Accomplishments FY 2001. For CARAT, the five Phase 1 projects initiated in FY 2000 were completed; the results are being evaluated by industry to determine if further development support is warranted.

Electric Vehicles R&D Long Term Goals and Benefits The Electric Vehicles R&D activity supports EERE and National Energy Policy (NEP) strategic objectives by developing and validating advanced electric vehicle battery technologies that will enable full-range electric vehicles and facilitate their commercial viability. Advanced lithium batteries are being developed under a cooperative agreement with the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC). Exploratory work on new electrode and electrolyte materials is conducted by the national laboratories and selected university researchers under Exploratory Technology Research. Advanced electric vehicles can provide the same level of comfort, performance, and affordability as today's internal combustion engines without their associated air and noise pollution. The Electric Vehicles R&D activity also helps support the automobile industry's response to the California Air Resources Board's Zero Emissions Vehicle program, as reaffirmed in January 2001. Projected benefits are shown below.

Cost per kWh of battery, based on production of 20 thousand, 40 kWh batteries per year.  The major goal of the Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D activity is to substantially reduce the non-engine parasitic energy losses in heavy vehicles, thus simultaneously increasing energy efficiency and reducing undesirable emissions without reducing vehicle functionality, durability, reliability or safety, and to achieve this goal in a cost effective manner. This reduction in weight will be reflected in increased productivity of the heavy duty fleet, since a smaller number of trucks will be capable of carrying the same freight tonnage. Innovative design of components, investigation and application of new physical concepts such as nanoparticle cooling for heat rejection systems, and development of manufacturing and production methodologies are essential parts in the technological portfolio of the activity.   Heavy Vehicle Systems R&D Petroleum Displaced (Millions Barrels per Day) Total Primary Energy Displaced (Trillion Btu) Energy Costs or Savings (Millions of $) Carbon Equivalent Emissions Displaced (MMTCe)  2005 0 1 6 0.01  2010 0.04 83 742 1.66  2020 0.37 775 6,976 15.50  Note: Program benefit projections are developed through an impact analysis process undertaken annually by EERE, based on assumptions for future energy markets derived from EIA's annual energy outlook.

Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives Mission: The Fuels Utilization R&D subprogram, along with partners in the energy and transportation industries, supports R&D that will provide transportation vehicle users with fuel options that are cost competitive, achieve high fuel economy, and deliver low emissions. Summary: The Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels (APBF) activity is essential to the development of petroleum-based fuels and lubricants that will allow high efficiency diesel engines for passenger vehicle, light truck, and heavy truck applications to achieve low emissions with minimal efficiency penalties while employing the use of advanced aftertreatment technologies. It is also paving the way for inclusion of renewable fuels such as oxygenates and biodiesel, as blends with petroleum-based clean diesel fuel, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. Other advanced fuels being researched, such as liquids made from natural gas, will facilitate expanded use of domestic energy reserves to produce transportation fuels. In the Alternative Fuels activity, the environmental impacts of fuels will be evaluated. Context: The combined efforts of the Fuels Utilization R&D subprogram will support the recommendations of the National Energy Policy by providing the necessary fuel formulations for highly efficient advanced compression ignition, direct injection (CIDI) engine and fuel cell powerplants. These powerplants could be the prime movers for our transportation vehicles in the future. In order to prevent new environmental and health effects problems, the environmental and health impacts of these fuels will be fully evaluated prior to any new fuel being introduced into the fueling infrastructure. The energy supply that serves the transportation sector is nearly all (95 percent) derived from petroleum: major products are gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Over half of the crude oil going into U.S. refineries is imported. Furthermore, imports of refined petroleum products make up about 10 percent of all petroleum products used. Imports of both crude and refined oil are projected to grow.   The Fuels Utilization R&D activities are integral to the success of other technology areas. Since Fuels Utilization R&D enables success of other specific technologies, the benefits are attributed to those specific technologies. Management Strategy The APBF activity is implemented through public/private partnerships that help to provide technical management for the program. An example of this is the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels - Diesel Emission Control (APBF-DEC) project. The APBF-DEC has a steering committee of government and industry partners from vehicle and engine manufacturers, energy companies, emission control manufacturers and their trade associations (e.g., American Petroleum Institute (API), Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA), Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and American Chemistry Council) that identifies priorities. The effort is cost shared 50/50 between government and industry. Projects in this area are awarded competitively and are evaluated annually with industry partners. Recently, four solicitations were issued. The solicitations sought contractors to conduct efforts in advanced lubricant research, system evaluations with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), SCR infrastructure, and systems evaluations with Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) absorber catalysts and DPFs. Six projects over three years will be carried out at contractor laboratories, with technical support from DOE national laboratories. All of the projects in the APBF activity are evaluated at the annual CIDI/Fuels review meeting by industry representatives. Based on the evaluations, project priorities are established, and decisions are made with respect to termination or re-direction. Long Term Goals and Benefits Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels The Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels activity identifies and develops new fuel options that will enable conventional and advanced propulsion vehicles to meet increasingly challenging performance, fuel-efficiency, and emissions targets. The EPA Tier 2 emissions standards for lightduty vehicles, the Consent Decree to be implemented in 2002, and the EPA heavy-duty engine emission standards affecting heavy-duty trucks require advanced fuel formulations to enable these systems to meet applicable emission requirements while maintaining fuel efficiency. - By 2004, develop advanced petroleum based fuels that will enable CIDI engines in automobiles and light trucks to achieve targets of 0.07 grams per mile NOx and 0.01 grams per mile Particulate Matter (PM) over full useful life of 120,000 miles, with a fuel economy penalty of less than 5 percent. At present, emissions performance for automobiles and light trucks, in laboratory conditions, meets the 0.07 grams per mile NOx and 0.01 grams per mile PM levels. However, current emissions system durability is less than 200 hours or less than 10,000 miles, which is far short of the required useful life (120,000 miles). - By 2007 enable heavy duty trucks to achieve the new heavy duty emission standards, with minimal loss of fuel economy, while meeting the   full useful life requirement. Currently heavy duty trucks cannot meet the 0.2 grams/hp hour NOx, 0.01 grams/hp hour PM for the full useful life of 435,000 miles. Long Term Goals and Benefits Alternative Fuels Activities in support of natural gas vehicle research and development are being discontinued in order to allow for funding of higher priority research activities. The most promising natural gas engines under development will be completed with available funds appropriated Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions prior to FY 2003. Successfully developed natural gas vehicle 0.1 technologies are expected to be deployed in revenue service 0.09 vehicles. The Environmental Impacts activity analyzes the atmospheric impacts and potential health effects that may be caused by the use of advanced petroleum-based fuels from mobile sources. The Environmental Impacts activity will develop more accurate measurement methods, which will then be applied to determine chemical and physical properties of emissions. Program Strategic Performance Goal ER1-15: Fuels Utilization Fuel Utilization R&D activities will decrease light truck and passenger vehicle engine-out emissions of particulate matter from 0.1 grams per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr) in 2001 to 0.06 g/bhp-hr by 2008. grams of PM per engine brake horsepower hour  0.08 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0 2001  2002  2003  2004 Year  2005  2006  2007  2008  The program target for FY 2003, which is an important milestone to achieving the overall goal, is projected to be achieved with funding at the FY 2003 level.  Performance Indicator The number of grams of particulate matter (engine-out) per engine brake horsepower-hour is the indicator of performance for the fuels utilization activity.   Annual Performance Results and Targets FY 2001 Results Established benchmark particulate matter emissions at 0.1 grams per brake horsepower-hour (light duty). FY 2002 Target FY 2003 Proposed Target Achieve 0.09 grams per brake horsepowerhour particulate matter emissions.  Significant Accomplishments and Program Shifts Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels The APBF activity is determining the effects of fuel composition on the efficiency and emissions performance of emerging, advanced compression ignition, direct injection (CIDI) engines. Through this research, the APBF activity will identify the most suitable fuels for these engines. Sulfur content in diesel fuel is a very important issue for the APBF activity. With the implementation of the EPA Tier 2 light-duty vehicle emission regulations and the heavy-duty engine emission regulations, the future viability of diesel-engine-powered vehicles will become dependent upon the ability of exhaust emission control devices to meet these emission standards. The most desirable emission control devices for NOx are deactivated by sulfur in currently available fuels. The fuels R&D activity is to support development of a complete system, with desulfurization and regeneration strategies, that will allow vehicles to meet very low emissions levels while keeping the fuel economy penalty at 5 percent or lower and meeting full useful life of 120,000 miles. FY 2001 In conjunction with API, MECA, EMA, and the American Chemistry Council, completed the planning of cost-shared projects to characterize sulfur effects on emission control devices, and to develop engine control strategies to reduce the fuel economy impact associated with the regeneration of devices poisoned by sulfur for automotive, SUV and heavy duty application engines. FY 2002 Complete the development of desulfurization and regeneration strategies on low sulfur fuel to enable very low emissions of 0.07 grams per mile NOx and 0.01 grams per mile particulate matter (PM) in automotive and sport utility vehicle applications, while keeping the fuel economy penalty less than at 5 percent. FY 2003 Complete 1,000 hours aging of the emission control system, and evaluate desulfurization and regeneration strategies developed in Fiscal Year 2002.   Alternative Fuels FY 2001 Collected samples for diesel and gasoline toxicity testing.

Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives Mission: The Materials Technologies subprogram supports the development of cost-effective materials and materials manufacturing processes necessary to successfully commercialize significantly more fuel-efficient, low-emission transportation vehicles. This sub-program is a critical enabler for concepts developed in other Transportation Sector subprograms. Summary: The Materials Technologies subprogram has two closely coordinated activities: Propulsion Materials Technology and Lightweight Materials Technology. Each of these two activities has sub-activities focused on automobiles or trucks. The Materials Technologies subprogram also includes maintenance and usage of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's world-class High Temperature Materials Laboratory (HTML), which has unique capabilities to support the transportation materials development effort. This facility also supports other materials efforts, and the training of technologists in cutting-edge materials characterization research. Context: The technologies developed in this program help to increase the fuel-to-motion conversion efficiencies of and to lighten autos and trucks. This responds to the ""corporate"" Program Strategic Performance Goal and the overall Energy Efficiency performance goals by decreasing the demand for petroleum by transportation vehicles. The general effects of reducing vehicle mass are quantified on page 4-10 of the National Energy Policy. The market for the technologies developed in this program is the North American market for autos and trucks of all classes, which accounts for 16 to 18 million vehicles per year. The technical barriers to commercialization are mainly associated with designing, manufacturing, repairing, recycling and disposing of vehicles that are acceptable to consumers and to society at large. Assuring that advanced high-performance materials meet these needs at acceptable life-cycle costs is the current challenge.   GPRA: The projected benefits of the Transportation Materials subprogram alone are shown in the table below. These benefits derive only from the weight reductions that are projected to be achieved. The benefits due to enabling more efficient propulsion systems are not included in order to avoid double-counting, as they are accounted for by other Transportation subprograms.

EERE's sectors analyze the impacts their programs will have on energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon reductions if all program goals are met, and future energy markets develop as expected. A sample of program benefit estimates are externally reviewed by Arthur D. Little.  Management Strategy: Since its beginning in 1991, the R&D portfolio of the Automotive Lightweight Materials (ALM) activity has been planned and coordinated in conjunction with DOE national laboratories and in partnership with the major U.S.-based automakers (Chrysler group of the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation). The Argonne National Laboratory has played a lead role in automotive recycling; the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has led efforts on nondestructive evaluation; the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has lead the Northwest Alliance for Transportation Technology; and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has performed as the overall field technical manager. Since about 1998, the planning and coordination has increased with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive suppliers such as Delphi, Budd, and Visteon, and with material supplier organizations such as the Aluminum Association, the American Iron and Steel Institute and the American Plastics Council. Planning and coordination with a similar effort sponsored by Natural Resources of Canada have increased since 1999, and a jointly funded project is now underway. The planning and coordination is continuous throughout the fiscal year, in order to determine appropriate funding for projects. Final decisions on projects remain with DOE program managers. ALM's R&D activities are conducted in industry research centers, national laboratories, and universities, with the specific mix being determined by the nature of the project. The more fundamental work is done by the universities and national laboratories, while the more applied work is performed by industry. The specific performers have largely been determined by DOE and the entities supplying the costshare, via solicitations of interest. The burden of proving out and implementing the technologies developed has invariably been on industry.   Formal cost-share by the automakers, their Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers and the material suppliers, has been about 50 percent of the overall efforts, or about a 1:1 match of the DOE funds. However, industry partners consistently claim additional, proprietary expenditures several times that of the formal figure. Of the DOE funds, about 50 percent has gone to the DOE national laboratories, 35 percent to industry researchers, and 15 percent to universities. Mid-course milestones, go/no-go decision points, end-points and downselects are identified in every project and updated as the projects proceed. The projects are usually of two to five years' duration. The projects are usually terminated when the end-point objectives are reached as determined by the participants and the ""stakeholder"" entities supplying the cost-shares. DOE's goals and planning for the High Strength/ Weight Reduction activity for heavy vehicles have been substantially augmented by workshops involving representatives from government, industry, and academia, which have resulted in the formulation of peer-group reviewed Multi-Year Program Plans (MYPPs). The MYPPs have identified the key technical thrust areas, technical barriers, potential market barriers, time frames for development, and estimated resources required to achieve the identified goals. Truck original equipment manufacturers (OEM), engine manufacturers, material suppliers, and key component manufacturers have been actively involved in the review, approval, and acceptance of the MYPPs, the subsequent research activities, and the evaluation and commercial implementation of the technical developments of the activity. The national laboratories (ORNL, PNNL, LANL, SNL, LLNL, and INEEL) are providing materials formulations, testing, and characterization support for the various projects, many selected through competitive solicitations, within the R&D program. The DOE program manager has the responsibility for making the final decisions in the selection of the projects within the programmatic portfolio. The Automotive Propulsion Materials activity focuses its efforts on enabling materials technologies-- technologies that are critical in removing barriers to the power electronics, fuel cell, and compression ignition, direct injection (CIDI) engine combustion and emissions control research programs. Industry technical teams set materials requirements and help DOE establish priorities for each of these programs. The Automotive Propulsion Materials activity is executed through the DOE national laboratories. Collaboration and cooperation across organizations is a crucial element of the management strategy. Scientists at the national laboratories are collaborating with industry to identify manufacturing barriers and to refine the necessary characteristics for meeting performance requirements. The individual automotive propulsion materials projects are evaluated by industry and academia as part of the annual program merit reviews and peer evaluations. As a result of these reviews, program priorities are re-evaluated and projects are either terminated, redirected, or continued. These program management decisions drive the funding allocations for the new fiscal year. The Propulsion Systems Materials activity for heavy vehicles is designed primarily as an enabling and support function for the development and ultimate deployment of cost-competitive, highly energy efficient, low emission heavy duty engines. Materials play several key roles in this effort: substantial reduction of parasitic energy losses within the engine that arise from friction and wear processes; ensuring the   compatibility of new and improved fuels and fuel mixtures with the various components of the engine including the combustion chamber; formulation of specialized catalysts for the treatment of exhaust gas emissions and trapping of particulates from the combustion process; and the amelioration of corrosion and erosion processes within the engine. Because of commercial requirements for long life of components in heavy vehicles, essential aspects of the performance of the materials in this program are durability and reliability. In this program also, the workshop approach involving representatives from government, industry, and academia provides the basis for the formulation of peer-group reviewed Multi-Year Program Plans (MYPPs) that identify the key technical thrust areas, technical barriers, potential market barriers, time frames for development, and estimated resources required to achieve the identified goals. The heavy engine manufacturers have had a key role in this process, with substantial input from the truck OEMs, material suppliers, and key component manufacturers. ORNL is the lead laboratory in performing heavy vehicle propulsion materials R&D. Many of the projects are selected through competitive solicitations, but some support identification of engine material degradation, material replacement strategies, and improved performance approaches. The DOE program manager has responsibility for making the final decisions in the selection of the projects within the activity portfolio. The HTML addresses materials formulations, performance, failure analyses, and characterizations, on micro- and macro-scales, as defined by peer-group reviewed proposals by industry to meet its needs with the use of state-of-the-art equipment located within the HTML user centers. Energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions in transportation systems, as affected by specific materials and the state of the materials, are often evaluated and quantified, but the determination of the durability and reliability of such materials may be even more important in assessing the value of the material in meeting industry's requirements. Projects conducted at the HTML generally involve shared responsibility between industry and HTML staff. Proprietary work is performed under a cost recovery system. Over 100 projects per year are conducted with time frames between three weeks and three months. Each project is a stand-alone activity. The HTML often provides the basis for materials optimization, which contributes to measurable improvement in the performance of vehicular systems. Long Term Goals and Benefits Lightweight Materials: There are two elements of this activity: 1)Automotive Lightweight Materials, which addresses lightweight materials for autos, and 2) High Strength Weight Reduction Materials which addresses lightweight materials for trucks. Automotive Lightweight Materials: The major goal of the Automotive Lightweight Materials (ALM) activity is to develop and validate lightweight materials and processing technologies that could significantly reduce automobile weight without compromising vehicle cost, performance or safety. This will require the development of advanced technologies for primary fabrication, secondary processing, forming, joining, assembly, and recycling. By 2000, developed and validated advanced material technology that:   - enables a 25 percent reduction in weight of the body and chassis - exhibits the performance, reliability, and safety characteristics comparable to those of conventional vehicle materials By 2004, develop and validate advanced material concepts that will: - enable reduction in the weight of body and chassis components by 50 percent and overall vehicle weight by 40 percent - exhibit the performance, reliability, and safety characteristics comparable to those of conventional vehicle materials - be cost competitive with life-cycle costs of conventional vehicle materials By 2011, develop and validate advanced material concepts that will: - enable reduction in the weight of body and chassis components by 60 percent in a mid-size passenger car - exhibit the performance, reliability, and safety characteristics comparable to those of conventional vehicle materials High Strength/ Weight Reduction Materials (HS/WR): The major goal of the HS/WR materials activity is to reduce the parasitic energy losses in heavy vehicles, due to current weight of the vehicle, without reducing vehicle functionality, durability, reliability or safety, and to achieve this goal in a cost effective manner. This reduction in weight will be reflected in increased productivity of the heavy duty fleet, since a smaller number of trucks will be capable of carrying the same freight tonnage. Lightweight material usage and innovative design of components, in addition to the full range of material production, fabrication, joining, repair and recycling methodologies, are essential parts in the technological portfolio of the program. By 2004, identify and develop advanced materials technology that can: - reduce the weight of an unloaded class 8 heavy vehicle from 23,000 pounds to 18,000 pounds through materials substitution and/or innovative design approaches By 2007, develop and validate advanced lightweight materials technology that will: - achieve the lightweighting goal above -exhibit the performance, durability, reliability, safety, and cost effectiveness comparable to those of current heavy vehicles Propulsion Materials: This activity also contains two elements, Automotive Propulsion Materials and Heavy Vehicle Propulsion Materials Automotive Propulsion Materials: The activity supports development of cost effective materials technologies that will enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of vehicles while maintaining safety, reliability, recyclability and economic competitiveness. To achieve this, the activity funds research and development work to remove materials-related technical barriers to the overarching development subprograms within the automotive and heavy duty vehicle programs. The activity therefore adopts the goals of the subprograms being supported. In the automotive area:   Compression Ignition, Direct Injection Engine (CIDI) Combustion and Emission Control: Develop advanced materials technology for application in high-fuel-economy, emissions-compliant passenger cars. By 2010, validate the capability of a CIDI engine-powered, high fuel economy vehicle to meet Tier 2, Bin 3 emissions (0.03 g/mile  NOx and 0.01 g/mile particulate matter (PM) with a fuel economy penalty of less than 5 percent. Fuel Cells for Transportation: Develop highly efficient, low or zero-emission, cost-competitive fuel cell power system technologies that operate on conventional and alternative fuels. By 2010, develop and validate fuel cell power system technologies (including fuel cell stack subsystem, fuel processor subsystem, and  balance of plant components) that are 45 percent efficient at 25 percent power and capable of meeting a high volume manufactured cost of $45/kW. Power Electronics: Develop power electronics and electric machinery technologies with increased component integration and flexibility, while improving reliability and ruggedness and achieving significant reductions in cost, volume and weight.  By 2006, develop and validate power electronics and electric machinery technologies that cost $6/kW and $4/kW respectively, with efficiencies of 98 percent and 97 percent respectively. : Heavy Vehicle Propulsion Materials: The major goal of this activity is to identify and provide improved and new materials to enable cost effective, high energy efficiency, substantially lower emission producing heavy duty engines, and exhaust treatment materials and devices possessing high durability and reliability. Lightweight materials applications in heavy duty engines may also provide an opportunity to reduce weight-induced parasitic energy losses, provided that the same cost, durability and reliability requirements can be met. By 2003, identify and verify the leading material degradation mechanisms in heavy duty engines produced by the use of substantial (>25 percent) exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in heavy duty engines, to achieve EPA emission requirements By 2005, develop and validate advanced materials technology that will: -substantially reduce the erosion and corrosion in heavy duty engines as a result of the use of EGR -exhibit the performance, durability, reliability, safety, and cost effectiveness comparable to those of current heavy duty engines High Temperature Materials Laboratory (HTML) The HTML addresses materials formulations, performance, failure analyses, and characterizations, on micro- and macro-scales, as defined by peer-group reviewed proposals to meet industry's needs, using state-of-the-art equipment located within the HTML user centers. Energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions in transportation systems, as affected by specific materials and state of the materials, are often evaluated and quantified, but the determination of the durability and reliability of such materials may even be more important in assessing the value of the material in meeting industry's requirements.       By 2003, demonstrate sub-angstrom resolution with the Aberration Corrected Electron Microscope in characterizing exhaust emission catalysts. By 2003, complete a user project with industry using the new in-situ temperature and atmosphere control systems on the neutron beam line to study degradation mechanisms in engine alloys. $ / pound  Cost of Carbon Fiber, $/pound $14.00  $12.00  $10.00  $8.00  Program Strategic Performance Goal ER1-16: Transportation Materials Technologies Transportation Materials Technologies R&D activities will reduce the production cost of carbon fiber from $12 per pound in 1998, to $3 per pound in 2006.

Mission Supporting Goals and Objectives Mission: Transportation Technologies deployment activities accelerate the adoption and use of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles to help meet national energy and environmental goals. Summary: The Department's deployment efforts logically follow and complement successful technology development by industry and government. As identified in the National Energy Policy, consumer education and demonstration activities are critical to accelerating the use of energy technologies. For the period 2003-2007, the program will promote both alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and advanced technology (high fuel economy) vehicles. To help build consumer confidence in these technologies and encourage private sector investment in supporting infrastructure, the program will:       forge new partnerships and nurture existing partnerships with fleet owners, fuel providers, vehicle manufacturers, and State and local governments; provide current, accurate, reliable information on all types of alternative fuels and vehicles; pursue rigorous, structured programs to test and evaluate cars and trucks that use alternative fuels and advanced technologies; implement the alternative fuel requirements of the Energy Policy Act; promote consumer acceptance of advanced technology cars and trucks with significantly improved fuel economy; and work with industry and universities to sponsor advanced vehicle competitions that push the technology envelope and expose numerous people, particularly future vehicle engineers, to these technologies.  These deployment activities will help ensure that advanced transportation technologies developed by government and industry will achieve sufficient market share to provide significant energy and environmental benefits. Context: The Deployment subprogram supports the use of new transportation technologies that will enable dramatic changes necessary to deal with rising dependence on oil imports and the increasing impact of transportation on air quality. A transportation system that uses a more diverse   fuel supply, and less oil overall, will increase competition and provide greater resiliency in the face of external disruptions. The Administration's National Energy Policy (May 2001) describes the need for a Federal role to promote the use of alternative fuels: ""...alternative fuels not only reduce dependence on petroleum transportation fuels. They reduce or entirely eliminate harmful emissions as well....The Federal Government has promoted development of alternative fuels for many years and this program has helped to reduce U.S. reliance on oil-based fuels."" (Page 6-8) This approach is also endorsed by the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, in its November 1997 recommendations: ""Government investment in R&D is crucial, but needs to be supplemented by standards, incentives, information, and education programs."" (page 3-9). While oil prices are above their low point of a few years ago, in real terms petroleum products are still inexpensive enough so that market conditions are not conducive to widespread use of, and investment in, alternative fuels and fuel-efficient vehicles. In addition, specific EPACT authorities are not adequate to address many of the technical and market barriers to increased use of these vehicles even though it would be in the national long-term interest. Until market and/or policy conditions change, Federal deployment programs will lay foundations for future use by focusing on proven niche markets where alternative fuel vehicles and advanced vehicles can successfully compete. Significant, but modest, market progress has been made. Since 1992, the number of alternative fuel vehicle models available to buyers has grown from 2 to 20; the number of alternative-fuel-capable heavy-duty engine models available has risen from 1 to 30; the number of natural gas refueling stations has increased from 500 to 1,250; the number of alternative fuel vehicles on the road has risen from 250,000 to 450,000. More than 2,000 natural gas transit buses are ordered each year, representing over 40 percent of the market. Despite this progress, significant market constraints have contributed to the slow adoption of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles including: uncertainty over Energy Policy Act regulations; lack of codes and standards; changing regulatory environment affecting conventional fuels, such as energy deregulation in the natural gas and electric utility markets. Other market barriers are also impeding the growth of these fuels and technologies, including: powers of incumbency by entrenched conventional fuel infrastructure; fragmented industry; lack of information and access to information; high transaction costs; and lack of capital to finance investments in infrastructure. The projected benefits of the Technology Deployment sub-program are shown in the table below:   GPRA: 2005 Petroleum Displaced (Million Barrels per Day) Total Primary Energy Displaced (Trillion Btu) Energy Costs or Savings (Millions of $) Carbon Equivalent Emissions Displaced (MMTCe) 0.11 0 90 1.7 2010 0.14 0 389 2.1 2020 0.29 0 1,287 3.6  Note: Program benefit projections are developed through an impact analysis process undertaken annually by EERE, based on assumptions for future energy markets derived from EIA's annual energy outlook. EERE's sectors analyze the impacts their programs will have on energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon reductions if all program goals are met, and future energy markets develop as expected. A sample of program benefit estimates are externally reviewed by Arthur D. Little.  Management Strategy: Deployment activities are highly leveraged and conducted in close cooperation with stakeholders, including the auto and fuels industry, State and local governments, and energy and environmental organizations. Funding for projects is determined competitively in accordance with DOE and Federal acquisition regulations. Non-Federal cost-share is 50 percent minimum in most projects, and as much as 5:1 for grant activities and university partnerships. Stakeholder input and on-going program evaluation are top priorities. Annually, DOE holds workshops in each DOE region, often followed by local workshops in selected communities. For example, an annual Clean Cities strategic planning session is held with key stakeholder groups and representatives. The Clean Cities annual conference showcases the year's successes and provides a venue for networking and vehicle sales. Clean Cities staff conducts an annual performance assessment of each participating Clean City. Reports assess the growth in alternative fuel vehicles and stations, major accomplishments, changes in market development strategies, and barriers to progress. Every five years, participating Clean Cities go through a renewal of their memorandum of understanding to update and validate local commitments. The Clean Cities program reports to Congress every two years. Regulatory programs are conducted in accordance with DOE and Federal regulations, in close coordination with the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Policy. In addition to formal notice and comment rulemaking, DOE conducts numerous workshops and stakeholder sessions to improve communication and understanding among covered fleets. DOE analytical work in support of the regulatory program is conducted by DOE national laboratories with professional peer review; draft and final reports are often published in the Federal Register. These reports are often cited by industry, government agencies, and other researchers. DOE developed models are in use worldwide by industry and government analysts of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The program is managed at DOE headquarters, however, the involvement of EERE regional office staff is critical to program success.   Long Term Goals and Benefits: The Department's efforts to encourage the deployment of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles are linked with and support State and local government initiatives. The Federal investment, together with these complementary efforts, will result in significant changes in the transportation market over the next five years. By 2007, AFVs and advanced technology vehicles will have achieved significant commercial success as increasing awareness of the benefits of fuel diversity and fuel-efficient vehicles spurs demand. This subprogram also supports other activities for which GPRA benefit metrics are estimated. Successful program implementation will result in increased penetration of alternative fuel vehicles and advanced technology vehicles in selected niche markets, laying a foundation for mass market use of many advanced vehicles by 2010. Critical mid-term milestones include: By 2007, the Clean Cities program will have helped 75 percent of the coalitions become self-sustaining facilitating a growth rate of at least 15 percent annually in alternative fuel vehicle use in Clean Cities. By 2007, education and outreach programs will have responded to 300,000 phone calls; provided information through the Internet to more than 1 million users; and published tens of thousands of documents. By 2007, student vehicle competitions will yield four hundred highly trained automotive engineers By 2007, the test and evaluation program will have conducted performance and reliability testing of thirty additional near market-ready advanced technology vehicles, and provided this information to consumers, fleets, and industry through web-sites and reports. By 2007, Federal agencies will have added at least 50,000 new alternative-fuel vehicles and improved fleet fuel economy, resulting in continued reduction in petroleum consumption by Federal fleets. Program Strategic Performance Goals ER1-17: Transportation Technology Assistance The Clean Cities program will increase the number of alternative fuel vehicles in the Clean Cities from 110,000 in 2001, to 250,000 in 2007 and to 400,000 in 2010; helping to create successful niche markets that will yield nationwide 1,000,000 alternative fuel vehicles, consuming 1 billion gallons of alternative fuel in 2010. Performance Indicator The number of alternative fuel vehicles in Clean Cities is the indicator of performance for the technology assistance activity.   Annual Performance Results and Targets FY 2001 Results Supported the annual acquisition of 10,000 alternative fuel vehicles in the Federal Fleet.

GX021-44-0695664	UTILIZATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES       The NEP embraces testing the usefulness of promising new technologies for understanding earthquakes and reducing earthquake-caused loss that have emerged since the original formation of NEHRP. Space-based technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can be utilized to provide continuous-in-time measurements of how the ground is deforming in areas of earthquake risk, and Synthetic Aperture Radar remote sensing applications are being developed to provide a spatially continuous image of crustal deformation. Other new geophysical methods include high-performance seismometers and seismographs for recording broadband, high-dynamic-range ground motion which are being installed world-wide. These stations are particularly important for emergency response to damaging earthquakes and for recording the strong motion data needed for building design. Borehole tiltmeters, borehole strainmeters, and laser-ranging instrumentation measure ongoing distortion of the earth's crust and may eventually aid earthquake prediction. Paleoseismic methods have rapidly advanced in the last decade and enable identification of pre-historic earthquakes and improved estimates of earthquake recurrence intervals. Probabilistic seismic hazard methods have been developed to provide estimates of earthquake ground motion in areas of low recurrence (such as the eastern U.S.). New Geographic Information System (GIS) technology will be used to integrate the information from these and a variety of other data sets.     New technologies in the area of earthquake engineering include advanced modeling and simulation of the dynamic, non-linear response of constructed facilities to earthquake effects, use of energy absorption systems, and passive and active control systems for reduction of structural response to ground shaking with resulting reduction in damage and interruption of functions, and innovative structural materials and systems such as high-performance composites for strengthening existing structures:       Advanced non-destructive evaluation methods such as ultrasonic, acoustic emission, infrared thermography techniques have been developed to monitor and assess structures and detect flaws which could make them more susceptible to ground shaking.     Optic-fiber sensors and innovative embedment techniques have proven to be extremely effective in sensing the dynamic response of structures under seismic conditions.     Neural networks and fuzzy logic-based mathematics techniques are very useful in identifying the properties and damage potential of large, complex structures.     Hydraulic, electromagnetic-based actuators, or their hybrids, are being developed to produce the required control forces to counter-balance impeding earthquake loads.     High-performance materials, including high-strength, highly ductile and weldable steel and alloys and cement-based materials which can be made super strong, tough, and durable--properties of importance to earthquake resistance--are becoming common for construction of critical buildings and infrastructures in seismic zones.

Later, an earlier version of this open file report was prepared for distribution, discussion and consideration at the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEP) Agencies Meeting held at the FEMA Building (Washington, D.C.) on July 8, 1997 (elebi and Nishenko, 1997). During this meeting, an ad-hoc committee comprising the authors of this report was formed. The report was forwarded to the representatives of several committees of ICSSC for evaluation and discussion. Ensuing were the following endorsements and/or presentations: 1. Based on input from various committees of ICSSC, on October 3, 1997, the Steering Committee of ICSSC endorsed the plan and provided comments summarized in Appendix B. 2. Following a presentation on October 18, 1997 by the senior author at the meeting of the Committee for the Advancement of Strong Motion Programs in the United States (CASMP [now reformed as COSMOS]), the plan was endorsed by the committee with comments provided in Appendix B. 3. A short presentation was made during the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) workshop on ""Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings  Strategic Plans 2005  the Second Decade"" held in Reno, Nevada on August 12-13, 1997. Following the meeting, the Applied Technology Council endorsed the plan (letter included in Appendix B). 4. Full Committee Meeting of ICSSC held in Washington, D.C. on October 29, 1997 voted to endorse the plan. This revised open-file report documents the endorsements and comments provided by different committees and organizations (Appendix B). Also included in this report is a summary of how data from instrumented structures is used with sample references (Appendix A). Finally, the ultimate purpose of the document is to further advance the consideration of this proposal (to instrument federally owned/leased buildings ) by the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEP) agencies and adopted by all federal agencies. 1.0 GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION There are two main approaches to evaluating seismic behavior and performance of structural systems. One requires a laboratory in which subsystems, components, or (if the facility is large enough) prototypes or large, scaled models of complete systems are tested under static, quasistatic, or dynamic loading. This approach does not necessarily demand a time-dependent testing scheme, such as a shaking table or an hydraulically powered and electronically controlled loading system; however, testing of structural systems under controlled simulated environments is desirable. Since the early 1950's such laboratory research has increased both in quantity and  4   quality, with engineering colleges in the United States and private and governmental laboratories in Japan playing a key role. Laboratory testing has also contributed substantially to our understanding of dynamic soil properties and the interaction phenomenon between the soil and structure (elebi and others, 1987). The second approach to evaluate behavior and performance of structural systems is to use the natural laboratory of the Earth, by recording structural motions on scale, and by observing and studying the behavior and damage, if any, to structures from earthquakes. By determining why specific designs lack earthquake resistance, and then by using extensive laboratory testing of modified designs, significant progress in improved designs can be achieved. For such design studies a natural laboratory would be a seismically prone area that offers a variety of structural systems. In optimum test areas, strong ground motions as well as moderatelevel motions would be experienced frequently. Integral to the ""natural laboratory"" compared to ""controlled laboratory "" approach is the advanced instrumentation of selected structures so that their responses can be recorded during future earthquakes. Thus, it is essential that integrated arrays of instrumentation be planned and installed to assess thoroughly the relation of ground motion that starts at a source and is transmitted through various soils to a substructure and finally to a superstructure. The direction for seismologists and engineers working together is clear: to develop integrated networks which measure the seismic source, the transmittal of ground motion, and the structural response processes. 1.1 General Objective The main objective of the seismic instrumentation program for structural systems is to improve our understanding of the behavior and potential for damage of structures under the dynamic loads of earthquakes. This will be achieved through the development of an integrated network that measures the earthquake source, transmitted ground motions, and structural response. These measurements will be correlated with observations of structural performance to evaluate current design and construction practices in order to minimize damage to buildings during future earthquakes. In accordance with Executive Orders 12941 [Seismic Safety of Existing Buildings] signed in December 1, 1994 and Executive Order 12699 [Seismic Safety of New Buildings] signed on January 5, 1990, this program will initially concentrate on instrumenting federally owned and leased buildings. 1.2 Prior Recommendations Although not directly targeted to federal buildings, several workshops and meetings in the past referred to importance of seismic instrumentation. For example, the following quotes are from ""Earthquake Prediction and Hazard Mitigation Options for USGS and NSF Programs"" published in 1976 by NSF and USGS: Page 51: Under Activities for Sub-element b: Acquisition of Strong-Motion Data: 1. Improve the national-strong-motion instrumentation network by: (a) Replacing obsolete instruments, (b) Installing adequate instrumentation arrays in all seismic regions,  5   (c) Developing arrays to measure the two and three dimensional distribution of ground motion. (d) Instrumenting representative types of structures, particularly in the more active parts of the country. The following quotes are from "" Recommendations for the Strong-Motion Program in the United States"" published in 1987 by Committee on Earthquake Engineering of the National Research Council"": Page 50: "" Plans for deployment of strong-motion instruments requires decisions as to whether they should be located in structures or in the free-field. Both kinds of data are needed by engineers, whereas seismologists prefer free-field data."" Page 49: ""An effective national strong-motion program must be concerned with all phases of activities, including strong-motion instrument development, deployment and operation of instruments, processing, archiving and dissemination of data, the uses of data, strong-motion research, strong-motion applications, integration of activities of various governmental agencies, universities and corporations taking part in strongmotion activities, and identification of the amount of funding required for such a national effort and the source of funding."" Many other reports published between 1976-1997 refer to the above recommendations. 1.3 Requisites of an Instrumentation Program The instrumentation of a structure should provide an optimal number of sensors to allow reconstruction of the response of the structure in sufficient detail to compare with the response predicted by mathematical models -- the goal being to improve the models. In addition, the data should make it possible to explain the reasons for any damage to the structure. The nearby freefield and ground-level time history should be known in order to quantify the interaction of soil and structure. More specifically, a well-instrumented structure for which a complete set of recordings has been obtained should provide useful information to: (1) check the appropriateness of the dynamic model (both lumped-mass and finite element) in the elastic range, (2) determine the importance of nonlinear behavior on the overall and local response of the structure, (3) follow the spreading nonlinear behavior throughout the structure as the response increases, and determine the effect of this nonlinear behavior on the frequency and damping, (4) correlate the damage with inelastic behavior models, (5) determine the ground-motion parameters that correlate well with building response and/or damage, and (6) make recommendations to improve seismic codes.  6   1.4 Code Recommendations for Instrumentation and Deficiencies Various codes in effect in the United States recommend different types and schemes of instrumentation depending upon their purposes. For example, the Uniform Building Code (UBC) of 1976 (and those that followed, including the recent 1997 issue), recommended that, for seismic zones 3 and 4, a minimum of three accelerographs be placed in every building over six stories with an aggregate floor areas of 60,000 square feet or more, and in every building over ten stories regardless of the floor area. The purpose of this requirement by the UBC was to monitor rather than to analyze structural response. In 1976 the City of Los Angeles adopted the UBC's recommendation but in 1983 revised this requirement to require only one accelerograph (to be deployed at the roof of the building). Recently, there has been a movement in Los Angeles to go back to the original UBC recommendation. The code instrumentation recommendation is illustrated in Figure 1a. The recommendations for instrumentation according to the UBC provisions does not allow complete analyses of a building. For example, a single triaxial accelerograph deployed at a floor (Figure 1a) does not allow the evaluation of torsional behavior of a building. Furthermore, only one vertical component at the ground or basement level does not allow evaluation of rocking motions of a building, if any. This type of instrumentation was prevalent particularly prior to the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, extensive instrumentation of building structures has been used as demonstrated in Figure 1b. Such a scheme involves distribution of triaxial channels as uniaxial channels on different floors of a building such that both translational and torsional motions of the structural system can be recorded. Also, additional vertical sensors on the ground floor or basement facilitates the evaluation of rocking motions. Furthermore, whenever physically possible, a free-field triaxial accelerograph is deployed in the vicinity of the building to facilitate additional studies related to soil-structure interaction and correlation studies of possible damage with free-field ground motions. Figures 1c and d illustrate special cases of instrumentation for diaphragm effect and base-isolated buildings. 1.5 Specific Issues Related to Seismic Instrumentation of Structures  Instrumentation of structures requires multiple single-channels rather than a tri-axial unit used for free-field deployment. There are hardware costs involved as presented later in this document. Instrumentation of structures needs interconnection of cables between the accelerometers and recorders for common-time recording. Until such time when wireless/remote motion detection/recording is feasible, reliable, and readily available, cables will have to be used to achieve common-time recording. Furthermore, recent digital systems with GPS options require additional cable connection between the GPS unit (which has to be placed at the roof or appropriate location so that the GPS unit can see the sky) and the recording unit.    7     There are installation costs. In some cases, this can be minimal and in other cases it can be substantial. The installation costs include conduits, pulling cables and electrical wiring.  Figure 1. Instrumentation Schemes  Finally, there is the maintenance, data retrieval, processing and dissemination issue. In the past, with analog instruments, this was a major problem. However with recent advances and improvements on digital accelerograph systems, the cost to maintain, retrieve, process and disseminate data from such systems will be lower.  1.6 Data Utilization Often, there are questions raised related to how data is utilized. In Appendix A, sample applications with references are provided. The list of references in Appendix A are by no means complete. However, it will provide sufficient leads and significant answers as to how data from instrumented structures are utilized. 2.0 WHY INSTRUMENT FEDERALLY OWNED BUILDINGS?  In general, it is very difficult to pursuade private property owners to instrument their buildings. In most cases, it is not possible to get private property owners to allow federal or state (public) agencies to deploy seismic instruments or conduct comprehensive damage surveys. Part of the problem for building owners is the concern for possible future litigation. This problem can be circumvented by instrumenting federally owned/leased structures. Federally owned/leased buildings will not require permits to deploy instruments by a federal agency nor will they be closed to federal inspection teams following a damaging earthquake. Making the connection between recording strong ground motions and documenting building performance is essential to a national earthquake engineering  8   program. [For example, very few (only 2) steel buildings that were damaged during the Northridge earthquake were instrumented (only minimally). Approximately 800 steel buildings that are being investigated for possible damage did not have any instruments in them. Currently, USGS is having trouble in obtaining permission from one of the owners of a (Northridge earthquake) damaged/retrofitted (SAC)9 steel building to deploy a seismic monitoring system (even at no cost to the owner)].  Instrumentation of federally owned and leased buildings supports the aims of the 1977 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act which refers to priorities such as:    Assist in developing improved building codes Assess earthquake hazards in federal facilities.  Instrumentation of federally owned and leased buildings is compatible with the spirit of the Public Law 101-614 NEHRP Reauthorization Act. Section 8(a)(1) of this law states: "" The president shall adopt, not later than December 1, 1994, standards for assessing and enhancing the seismic safety of existing buildings constructed for or leased by the Federal Government...."" Instrumentation of new and existing federal buildings is particularly important in light of Executive Orders 12941 [Seismic Safety of Existing Buildings] signed in December 1, 1994 and Executive Order 12699 [Seismic Safety of New Buildings] signed on January 5, 1990. These two executive orders demonstrate both the concern and the need for safety of both the personnel that work within the buildings and the public that use the buildings. Public safety will be enhanced by seismic instrumentation because seismic instrumentation will provide important data to:     Assess the causes of damage, if any. Develop the best methods to repair damaged structures. Assess the vulnerability of the buildings Evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the buildings for planning for and selection of the best methods to strengthen and retrofit structures, if necessary.      There are approximately 84,000 federally owned and 5000 federally leased buildings in Seismic Areas 3 and 4 (as defined in the Seismic Zone Map of the United States in the Uniform Building Code [UBC 1997]). The acquisition value of these buildings is $16 billion (does not include contents). Therefore, protection of property is also an issue. The distribution of federally owned/leased properties are illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 2 (both from GAO/GGD 92-62 Quake Threatened Buildings, 1992). Instrumentation of federal buildings therefore will lead to improvements in the seismic performance of the buildings, thus resulting in safety to employees and the public, and to protection of public property.  SAC buildings are those steel buildings damaged during the Northridge earthquake and studied by a consortium consisting of Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC), Applied Technology Council (ATC) nd California Universities for Research in earrthquake Engineering (CUREe). 9  9      Federal agencies should set an example by instrumenting federally owned/leased buildings. Evolution of new technologies in earthquake resistant design, construction and retrofit practices requires systematic and efficient verification of the performance of structures built with the new technologies or retrofitted with new methods. Such verification can only be accomplished by strategically deploying seismic sensors in such structures to record their performances during future events. Several federal buildings in seismic areas are being retrofitted by such emerging technologies (e.g. VA Hospital in Long Beach, Court of Appeals Building in San Francisco [both buildings using base-isolation], a Navy Building in San Diego [using viscous-elastic dampers]). Table 1. Statistical Distribution of Federally Owned/Leased Buildings and Employees in Seismic Risk Zones Nationwide (from GAO/GGD -92-62: Quake Threatened Buildings) Level of Seismic Risk VERY HIGH HIGH MODERATE LOW Level of Expected Damage Most Buildings Many Buildings Some Buildings No Buildings Number of Owned Buildings 32,000 52,000 99,000 234,000 Number of Leased Space Locations 2,000 3,000 22,000 41,000 Number of Employees 215,000 224,000 668,000 1,759,000  Figure 2. Distribution of Federally Owned Buildings and Acquisition Values (from GAO/GGD -92-62: Quake Threatened Buildings)    The severity of damages to numerous steel structures during the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake (Ms=6.7) and Kobe (Japan) earthquake of January 17, 1995 (Ms=6.8) is a perfect example that points to the need for instrumentation of both the new generation design of midrise to high-rise steel buildings but also those that were repaired and/or retrofitted by methods developed for the particular damage problem. It is therefore essential to obtain data during  10   future events for response studies to assess the effectiveness and revise and/or improve the new methods of design, construction and retrofitting.   Federal building inventory should be compatible with at least the recommendations of Uniform Building Code. Within the United States, there are large inventories of buildings within 10 km of major faults capable of generating M>7 earthquakes. This is particularly important now because, very recently, the Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) issued the 1996 edition of the Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary which has provisions for increasing the design base shear of such structures by up to 100 % depending on the distance of a building from the fault. It is now also reflected in the 1997 issue of the Uniform Building Code. This implies that forecasting of the performance of buildings within 10 km of major faults, where they are subjected to higher levels of motions, must be done more informatively. This requisite information can only be acquired by studying response data from buildings during earthquakes. Recent developments on ""Performance Based Design"" requires response data from all types of structures. Such data will help improve future design procedures based on this concept.    3.0 SUGGESTED ACTIONS: (a) Instrumentation of federally owned and leased buildings should be confined only to Seismic Areas 3 and 4 according to the Seismic Zone Map of the United States in the Uniform Building Code [UBC 1997] and on a selective basis that reflects the objectives of the strong-motion instrumentation of structures program. Alternatively, the areas for instrumentation can be identified by the recent seismic hazard maps of conterminous United States that indicate the highest risk or highest PGA with 10 % probability of exceedance (Frankel and others, 1997a and 1997b). (b) As an initial target, 0.1 % of the buildings can be feasibly instrumented. The number would reach approximately 90 (of the approximately 84,000 federally owned and 5000 federally leased buildings in areas 3 and 4) based on the current information and data base of inventory and geographical distribution of federally owned/leased structures within the seismic areas of the United States). This will create a visible program and set an example to other institutions, state agencies, and private owners. (c) Funding for this effort should be provided by:  Individual agencies,  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),  General Services Administration (GSA),  Department of Defense  Tie into EO 12941 and 12699  A new Executive Order  Other sources [e.g. special add-on to budget, NSF, etc.]. (d) USGS should provide expertise and guidance in deployment and continuous monitoring on a reimbursable basis, as well as in management and dissemination of 11   acquired data. USGS should have umbrella agreements with FEMA, GSA and all other federal agencies. [USGS currently cooperates with the Veterans Administration, and to a lesser extent with GSA, to instrument, monitor, retrieve and disseminate data]. (e) Seismic instrumentation of federally owned/leased buildings should be included in the revisions of TR 4 & TR 5 prepared by ICSSC. (f) Final selection of buildings to be instrumented should be made according to a protocol to be developed by an interagency committee drawn from members of the ICSSC. Some of the issues that would be addressed by this protocol include:  Selection Criteria Building Types  Which of the 15 model building types [e.g. FEMA 178] do we instrument?  Additional priorities based on occupancy class, usage [re ICSSC TR-17]  Are there specific lessons or experiments that we need to conduct/learn for a specific building type?  Do we want to develop ""Demonstration"" Experiments? [e.g. similar structures in close proximity, with and without retrofit/rehabilitation or built to different codes [pre- and post- ICSSC benchmarks] Building Locations  Selection with respect to ground conditions (e.g. ""hard rock"" vs. ""soft rock"")  Selection with respect to geologic considerations[e.g. distance from a specific earthquake source -- strike slip, normal, thrust faults)  Selection with respect to geographic considerations[e.g. California, Seattle, Utah, Central US]  ""Demonstration"" Experiments [e.g. Two similar structures in close proximity, built on different types of ground ]  Site Surveys for Geologic Conditions (all sites of instrumented buildings should be included in a separate or ongoing site characterization efforts). Some possible considerations for site surveys are:     Development of a standardized approach [adopt ATC-26-1 standards for all sites?] Surface geology, Borehole logs [Lithology, Shear wave velocities, other geotechnical parameters] Consideration of 3-D Sedimentary Basin structure, Wave Focusing and Defocusing Effects  Instrumentation  Hardware  Deployment  12   Within the building(s), development of standardized deployment for specific structure classes, and designs Outside the building(s), development of `rule of thumb' for distance from structure to record true `free field' measurements [re. soil-structure interaction]. (g) Schedule   Develop funding base for initiative and/or partnership agreements Set up ICSSC Sub-Committee for Instrumentation Issues to deal with : (a) development of selection criteria of structures for instrumentation, (b) preliminary selection of specific structures, (c) strong motion experiments as necessary and feasible, (d) instrumentation, (e) data archiving & distribution, (f) organization of workshops as necessary Meeting to finalize building selection and strong motion experiments. Deployment     4.0 COST/BUDGET ISSUES:  The cost of hardware and installation for each building can vary between $30-60 K based on the number of channels involved. It seems feasible to provide a standardized 12-18 channel instrumentation scheme that follows in general the illustration shown in Figure 1b. Therefore on the average $ 50 K per building is the current average expenditure for a building. This normally will include a triaxial free-field station in the immediate vicinity of the building, if physically possible. Therefore, notwithstanding special cases discussed below, hardware and installation costs for 90 federally/owned and leased buildings will be $4.5 M. This amount is for a duration of 5 years based on a calculation that approximately 18 buildings/per year can be instrumented. Instrumentation costs of $50 K for a building and its contents is a small investment when compared with the actual worth of a building (and its contents). In special cases, the geotechnical , geological and topographical environment of a building could provide opportunities to deploy additional hardware in the vicinity of the building to assess the performance of building structures in relation to those environs. I suggest consideration of $0.5 M/yr for such special cases, again for the 5 year duration. For example,  One important aspect of structural response is the soil-structure interaction. In many cases, under a specific geotechnical environment, certain structures will respond differently than if that structure were built as a fixed based structure on a very stiff (e.g rock) site condition. This alteration of vibrational characteristics of structures due to soil-structure interaction can be either beneficial or detrimental to their performances. To date, the engineering community is not clear about the pros and cons of SSI. In Mexico City, during the Michoacan earthquake of Sept. 19, 1985, many structures were negatively affected due to SSI because the lengthening of their fundamental periods placed them in a resonating environment close to the approximately 2-second resonant period of Mexico City lakebed. On the other hand,    13   under different circumstances, SSI may be beneficial because it produces an environment whereby the structure escapes the severity of the response spectra due to shifting of its fundamental frequency. Certainly, in a basin such as that of Los Angeles area, SSI may cause both beneficial and detrimental effects in the response of structures. The identification of the circumstances and the parameters for which SSI is beneficial or detrimental is a necessity. In some cases; therefore, we may wish to deploy additional hardware (e.g. free-field accelerographs on the surface and in boreholes [downhole accelerographs].  There are many urban areas in the United States where structures are built on hills. There is now sufficient evidence to consider a phenomenon known as the topographical effect  amplification of ground motions due to the geological and geometrical characteristics of the topography of the site of a building. Thus, in some cases, we could deploy additional free-field accelerograph to assess whether the motions at the site of the building are amplified due to topographical effects.     The total budget envisioned for the 5 year duration of this effort will be $5 M. or $1M /year. Other costs such as maintenance costs should be arranged by an umbrella agreement between USGS and the agencies involved.

A preliminary list of applications of response data with sample references is provided. An example of different analyses performed on data recorded from a 30-story building during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is used to illustrate uses of response data. A recent seismic monitoring method being developed using GPS technology is introduced. GPS technology provides a potential new tool for monitoring tall buildings as well as other long-period structures. INTRODUCTION Seismic monitoring of structural systems constitutes an integral part of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program in the United States and similar programs in other countries. Recordings of the acceleration response of structures have served the scientific and engineering community well and have been useful in assessing design/analysis procedures, improving code provisions and in correlating the system response with damage. Table A.1 summarizes some of the uses for the data from instrumented structures. Unfortunately, only a few damaged structures have been instrumented in advance to perform studies of the initiation and progression of damage during strong shaking (e.g. Imperial County Services Building during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake, [Rojahn and Mork, 1981]). In the future, instrumentation programs should consider this deficiency. Jennings (1997) summarizes this view as follows: ""As more records become available and understood, it seems inevitable that the process of earthquake resistant design will be increasingly, and quite appropriately, based more and more upon records and measured properties of materials, and less and less upon empiricism and qualitative assessments of earthquake performance. This process is well along now in the design of special structures"". The methods used in studying structural response records are quite diverse: (a) mathematical modeling (finite element models varying from crude to very detailed, subjected to time-history, response spectrum or modal analyses). The procedure requires the blueprints of the structures which may not be readily accessible; (b) system identification techniques: single input/single output or multi input/multi output. In these procedures, the parameters of a model are adjusted for consistency with input and output data (Ljung, 1987); (c) spectral analyses: response spectra, Fourier amplitude spectra, autospectra, Sx or Sy, crossspectral amplitudes Sxy, and coherence functions () [using the equation : 2 xy (f) = S2xy (f) / Sx (f)Sy (f) ] and associated phase angles (Bendat and Piersol, 1980); and 17   (d) simple procedures based on principles of structural dynamics (e.g. recently Jennings (1997) analyzed data from two buildings within close proximity (<20 km) to the Northridge epicenter, calculated the base shear from the records as 8 and 17 % of the weights of the buildings, drift ratios as 0.8 and 1.6 % (exceeding code limitations). Jennings (1997) states: ""A difference between code design values and measured earthquake responses of this magnitude  approaching a factor of ten  is not a tenable situation."" Table A.1.

However, observations of damages during the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes, have forced engineers and scientists to focus on performance based seismic design methods and to find new techniques to control drift and displacements. To verify these developments, sensors directly measuring displacements or relative displacements (transducers, laser devices and GPS units) are now being considered. A recent development in this direction is presented later in this paper. In general, accelerometer deployments, as depicted in Figure 1 (of the main text), fall into three categories: (a) minimal [a triaxial accelerograph only at the roof of a building or three triaxial accelerographs deployed at the roof, mid-floor and gound (or basement) levels  the later better known as the UBC recommended instrumentation]; (b) extensive [combinations of uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial accelerometers to record translational, torsional and rocking motions]; (c) special cases [additional accelerometers to detect deformations of in-plane motions of flexible diaphragms]; (d) special cases [additional accelerometers to detect relative vertical displacements of isolators of a base-isolated structure]. A SAMPLE CASE: Pacific Park Plaza (Emeryville) The set of records from the 30-story Pacific Park Plaza (PPP) building is possibly the most studied building response data recorded during the Ms=7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989. The building is an equally spaced three-winged, cast-in-place, ductile, momentresistant framed structure. Constructed in 1983 and instrumented in 1985, it is the tallest reinforced concrete building in northern California. A general view, a plan view, a threedimensional schematic, and its instrumentation is shown in Figure A.1 (elebi, 1992, 1996). Twenty-one channels of synchronized uniaxial accelerometers are deployed throughout this structure. Three channels of accelerometers are located at the north free-field outside the building. All are connected to central recording systems. In addition, a triaxial strong-motion accelerograph is deployed at a free-field site on the south side of the building (SFF or EMV10,11). The foundation of PPP is a 5-foot-thick concrete mat supported by 828 (14-inch-square) prestressed concrete friction piles, each 20-25 m in length, in a primarily soft-soil environment, with an average shear-wave velocity between 250 and 300 m/s and a depth of approximately 150 m to harder soil. The building, at 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake, had considerably amplified input motions but was not damaged during the earthquake. The east-west components of acceleration recorded at the roof and the ground floor of the structure, at the associated free-field station (SFF in Figure A.2) and, for comparison, the motion at Yerba Buena Island (YBI), the In most studies, the site of south free-field (SFF) is referred to as the Emeryville site (EMV). In 1997, the analog recording instruments at Emeryville were upgrade to digital. A downhole accelerograph was installed at the same location as the surface free-field station, SFF. 10 10  19   closest rock site with a peak acceleration of 0.06 g, are shown in Figure A.2. The response spectra also shown in Figure A.2 clearly demonstrate that the motions at EMV were amplified by as much as five times when compared with YBI. Amplification is also indicated by the amplitude of the peak accelerations (0.26 g for EMV and 0.06 g for YBI). The differences in peak acceleration at the free-field station (0.26 g) and at the ground floor of the building (0.21 g) (Figure A.2a) suggest that there was soil-structure interaction (SSI).  Figure A.1. Plan layout and three-dimensional schematic and instrumentation scheme of Pacific Park Plaza (PPP), Emeryville, Ca. In the design of the building, site-specific design response spectra (based on three probabilistic earthquakes based on expected levels of performance) were used: (a) the maximum probable earthquake (50 % probability of being exceeded in 50 years with 5 % damping) anchored at zero period acceleration (ZPA) of 0.32g., and two maximum credible earthquakes both with 10 % damping but 10 % probability of being exceeded in (b) 50 years [ZPA of 0.53 g] and (c) 100 years [ZPA of 0.63 g]. The design response spectra and the spectrum of the EW component of recorded motion at the SFF is shown in Figure A.3. The ZPA of the recorded EW acceleration at SFF (0.26 g) (at 100 km from the epicenter) is close to that of the postulated maximum probable earthquake (0.32 g). Furthermore, the spectral accelerations of the EW component of SFF is considerably higher than the maximum probable earthquake for periods >0.6 seconds  that is, practically for the first three modes of the building. Therefore, one important conclusion derived from the records is that improvements are necessary in establishing site-specific design response spectra to account for realistic shaking at a specific site taking into account expected future closer earthquakes likely to produce larger peak accelerations.  20   LPE (EW): PPP & YBI  LPE (EW): PPP & YBI  SPEC.

Design response spectra and response spectra of recorded motions at the ground floor and SFF of Pacific Park Plaza. Also shown is the 1979 UBC response spectrum for comparison. Using different methods, the building has been studied in detail by Anderson and Bertero (1994), Anderson and others (1991), Kagawa and others (1993), Kagawa and Al-Khatib (1993), Aktan and others (1992), Kambhatla and others (1992) and elebi and Safak (1992). All investigators agree that the predominant three response modes of the building and the associated frequencies (periods) are 0.38 Hz (2.63 s), 0.95 Hz (1.05 s), and 1.95 Hz (0.51 s). These three modes of the building are torsionally-translationally coupled (elebi, 1996) and are depicted in the cross-spectra (Sxy) of the orthogonal records obtained from the roof, ground floor and SFF (the south free-field site) (Figure A.4) and the normalized cross-spectra of the orthogonal records (bottom right in Figure A.4). The frequency at 0.7 Hz (1.43 s) observed in the spectra is this site frequency (elebi, 1996). System identification techniques, when applied to the records of this building, yielded unusually large damping ratios corresponding to the 0.38-Hz first-mode frequency [11.6 % (NS) and 15.5 % (EW)] [Table A.2] (elebi, 1996a). Such unusually high damping ratios attributed to a conventionally designed/constructed building with its large mat foundation in a relatively soft geotechnical environment is due to radiation (or foundation) or material damping. This is one of two 21   cases where large damping percentages implied by the recorded responses of buildings have been attributed to radiation damping; the other case is from the Olive View Hospital in Sylmar, Ca.  data from the Northridge earthquake (elebi,1997).

Also, it is noted in Table A.2 that although flexibility of the foundation was considered in the 1985 analyses, the structural frequency remained the same as the frequency determined with fixed base assumption. Clearly, the mathematical models developed at that time needed improvements. This conclusion could only be reached because we have recorded on scale motions. Most recent studies indicate that the frequencies from recorded motions can be matched when soil-structure interaction (SSI) is incorporated into the mathematical models (Kagawa and others, 1993; Aktan and others, 1992; Kambhatla and others, 1992). Furthermore, a study of the building for dynamic-pile-group interaction by (Kagawa and Al-Khatib, 1993; Kagawa and others, 1993) indicates that there is significant interaction. Their studies show that computed 22   responses of the building using state-of-the-art techniques for dynamic-pile-group interaction compares well with the recorded responses. On the other hand, Anderson and others (1991) and Anderson and Bertero (1994) concluded that soil-structure interaction was insignificant for Pacific Park Plaza during the earthquake. They compared the design criteria, code requirements, and the elastic and nonlinear dynamic response of this building due to the earthquake using both simplified and detailed analytical models. DEVELOPMENT OF GPS BASED DISPLACEMENT MONITORING Recording displacements at higher sampling rates than before (e.g. 10 Hz) using GPS technology is now possible. This provides a great opportunity to reliably monitor tall buildings, perhaps buildings that are 20-40 stories or more. The majority of such buildings are flexible steel framed structures whose period can be estimated with the empirical formula: T = 0.1 N, where N is the number of stories of the buildings. The frequencies corresponding to the fundamental periods of most tall buildings over 20 stories are 10-20 times the Nyquist frequency of the sampling, which is sufficient to accurately assess its average drift ratio and therefore the damageability of a building. During extreme motions caused by earthquakes and strong winds, data recorded from tall buildings monitored with GPS units can be used by building managers/engineers to assess the performance of building performance, which is accomplished by establishing different threshold displacements or drift ratios and identifying changing dynamic characteristics. Such information can then be used to secure public safety and/or take steps to improve the performance of an individual building. On the other hand, while displacements, relative displacements or average drift ratios can be measured directly using the GPS technology, a double-integration process, not normally automated, is required to calculated the same. To investigate the feasibility of using GPS technology to monitor tall buildings, a rectangular, fixed-based, steel bar (H [height]=6', B [width]=2"", t (thickness]=1/8"") was used to simulate an approximately 40 story flexible building (Figure A.5). With a 10 Hz sampling GPS unit attached at its tip, the bar was set to free vibration. Figure A.5 also shows a sample displacement plot and amplitude spectra indicating the fundamental frequency (period) to be 0.245 Hz (4.08 s) and yielding a damping percentage of approximately 2 %. This simple test shows that with GPS, sampling at 10 Hz, a clear and accurate response history (displacements, drift ratios and dynamic characteristics)can be obtained (elebi et al, 1997a). A project is underway to deploy permanent GPS units on the roof of a tall building already instrumented with accelerometers. This will facilitate comparison of roof displacements recorded with the GPS unit and those derived by double-integration of the acceleration recordings from the same location. Possible steps in use of the GPS based data are: (1) A building equipped with GPS units on its roof can be configured to provide real-time or near real-time data to indicate its real-time average drift ratio and changes in dynamic characteristics after it has exceeded predetermined thresholds (e.g. A, B and C as shown in Figure A.6). When warranted, according to pre-established procedures, this information can be made available to building managers (or interested parties) in real-time or near real-time for additional assessment and action. If a situation is serious, the management may make decisions to inspect/vacate the building and to secure safety of the occupants.  23   (2) The collected information on the response of the building during strong motion events can be used to make decisions for further evaluation of the damageability of the building, and to develop future repair/retrofit schemes.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, various uses of data from instrumented structures are summarized. A preliminary listing and classification of the different uses of data is provided with some sample references. A data set from an instrumented building is used to demonstrate extraction of dynamic characteristics (modal frequencies) and other features (radiation damping). It is shown for this case that during future earthquakes that are closer to the building, the design response spectra will be significantly exceeded. On a generic note, it is noted that development of design response spectra particularly for longer periods should be improved and soil-structure interaction should be considered in design/analyses procedures. Furthermore, a recent method being developed for monitoring structures using GPS technology is introduced.  24   REFERENCES FOR APPENDIX A: Aktan, H., Kagawa, T., Kambhatla, A., and elebi, M., 1992, Measured and analytical response of a pile supported building, in Proceedings, Tenth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering: A.A.

Argonne National Laboratory, as the   successor to the Met Lab, led the research that supports every main nuclear   power system throughout the world.         Dec.  2, 1962: President John Fitzgerald   Kennedy and Atomic Energy Chairman Glenn Seaborg celebrate the 20th anniversary   of the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction. (Click the image to   see a larger version of the photo.)         Study of nuclear reactions continued to be of paramount importance in   the lab's early days -- properties of uranium, plutonium, and other nuclear   elements; structural materials and coolants; nuclei and other atoms. Scientists   from different disciplines worked to elucidate the process of fission --   chemists, physicists, reactor designers. Chicago Pile 3, the world's first   heavy-water-moderated reactor, was designed by Eugene Wigner. At Fermi's   request, Zinn directed its construction in Illinois; it achieved criticality in   1944. Zinn also studied fast neutron reactors and designed the Experimental   Breeder Reactor I -- originally called CP-4. Like the safety rod he devised for   CP-1, it was nicknamed ZIP (this time meaning ""Zinn's Infernal Pile"") and built   in Idaho at the National Reactor Testing Station.                                 From left: Chicago Pile 2, Chicago Pile 3 and Chicago Pile 5. As the   succesor to the Met Lab, Argonne led the research that supports every major   type of nuclear power system in the world. (Click photos to see larger   images.)         Among the earliest reactors designed by Argonne scientists was a   pressurized-water submarine thermal reactor developed for Westinghouse in 1947.   They designed and developed the reactor core for the world's first   atomic-powered submarine and, in 1950, built and operated the first submarine   reactor prototype, the Zero Power Reactor I (ZPR-1). In January 1954, the    USS Nautilus , the first atomic submarine, was launched.  Nautilus    introduced engines with virtually unlimited sources of power, allowing   submarines to remain under water for indefinitely long periods and to travel at   significantly increased speeds. The Argonne-designed reactor in the    Nautilus  lasted for 62,500 miles including a dramatic crossing of the   Arctic Ocean in 1958. Its scientific mission determined that the ocean depth at   the North Pole, two-and-a-half miles, was far greater than previously   estimated.         The  Zero Power Plutonium   Reactor. (Click the image to see a larger version of the photo.)         In 1953, ZPR-2 experiments at Argonne demonstrated the design   feasibility of the Savannah River Production reactor in South Carolina. A   decade later, the ninth in the series of zero power reactors, built in 1964,   explored fundamental issues associated with full-size reactors. ZPR-9 provided   data for nuclear rocket reactors and on the use of aluminum as a neutron   reflector. The series of Zero Power Reactor experiments -- including the Zero   Power Plutonium Reactor, on which physics studies were conducted -- continued   until 1982 when ZPR-6 was shut down.                                 Left: The first usable amount of electricity from nuclear power was   provided by Experimental Breeder Reactor I on Dec. 20, 1951. (Click the image   to see a larger version of the photo.)        Right: On Aug. 26, 1966, President Lyndon Johnson and Glenn Seaborg   participated in ceremonies naming Experimental Breeder Reactor I a National   Historical Landmark. Johnson holds one of the original bulbs lighted by EBR-I.   (Click the image to see a larger version of the photo.)        The Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) achieved many benchmarks   during its 14 years of operation. It was the first nuclear reactor to produce   electric power when it lighted a string of four 150-watt bulbs on December 20,   1951; the next day 100 watts were generated. In 1953, it was the first reactor   to demonstrate the breeder principle -- generating, or ""breeding,"" more nuclear   fuel than it consumed. It was the first, in November 1962, to achieve a chain   reaction with plutonium; and the first to demonstrate the feasibility of using   liquid metals at high temperatures as a reactor coolant. EBR-I gained National   Historic Landmark status in 1966.

(Click the   image to see a larger version of the photo.)         Benchmark research in boiling water reactors began with a series of   BORAX experiments in 1953, the year Argonne staff was fully established at the   laboratory's new site in DuPage County, Ill. In 1955, BORAX III produced enough   electricity to light up the town of Arco, Idaho -- the first time in history   that any town had all its electricity provided by nuclear energy. The last of   the BORAX series -- BORAX V, completed in 1964 -- allowed scientists to   evaluate and study nuclear heat concepts and to demonstrate actual nuclear   super-heat operation. The BORAX experiments led to the construction and   operation of the extremely stable Experimental Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR) in   1956. It proved that a direct cycle boiling water reactor system could operate,   even at power levels five times its rated heat output, without serious   radioactive contamination of the steam turbine.         The  Experimental Boiling Water Reactor   operated with a largely plutonium core. (Click the image to see a larger   version of the photo.)         EBWR, operated with a largely plutonium core, provided valuable   information on plutonium recycle operation of water reactors -- it generated   plutonium-based electricity for Argonne's physical plant in 1966. When closed   down the following year, EBWR had established a reputation as the forerunner of   many commercial nuclear energy plants. One of those is the Commonwealth Edison   facility at Dresden, Ill., which in 1960, became the first privately operated   nuclear energy plant.        In the early 1960s, two major programs were underway -- construction of   Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) in Idaho, and fast breeder reactor   studies. EBR-II, an experimental fast breeder reactor power station of 20   Megawatt capacity, produced electricity  and  proved the feasibility of   the closed fuel cycle. It thus demonstrated the potential advantages of using   fast reactors for central station power plants.        The scientists' concept was a bold departure from traditional reactor   design. Experimental Breeder Reactor II and its primary system components --   including pumps, heat exchanger, instrumentation, and fuel handling system --   were submerged in a large tank of sodium during operation. This pool, or pot,   concept gained wide acceptance. The closed fuel cycle was also unusual.   Experimental Breeder Reactor II was the first reactor to contain, as an   integral part, a fuel reprocessing system that allowed spent uranium fuel to be   removed from the sodium-cooled reactor, purified and made into new fuel   elements, and then replaced into the reactor -- the ultimate recycling,   energy-saving, and waste management system.         ""Master -slave manipulators,"" operational   in 1949, were developed by Argonne to handle reactor components remotely.   (Click the image to see a larger version of the photo.)         All this modern-day alchemy was done by remote control from behind   five-foot thick walls. The multi-disciplinary effort included chemical   engineers who devised new chemical treatment methods, metallurgists who   developed tools and techniques for making fuel pins, and engineers who designed   and built remote viewing and handling devices. An early device, operational in   1949, was the ""master-slave manipulator."" A mechanism of bars, semi-universal   joints, and claw-like hands for handling ""hot"" isotopes by remote control, it   provided many applications for industries in which dangerous and corrosive   chemicals were used. It also provided basic research into robotics.        Experimental Breeder Reactor II began operation in 1964. The turbine   generator was synchronized and first delivered power to the Idaho test loop at   Argonne-West on August 7. One-third of the core was filled with experimental   subassemblies. Plutonium-uranium oxides, carbides and nitrides were among fuels   tested to evaluate their performance after long exposure. The highest burnup   attained was 13.8 percent in an oxide-type fuel, significantly higher than the   usual 10 percent. By the end of 1970, the reactor had generated more than 250   million kilowatt-hours of electricity. During the first five years, the   reactor's Fuel Cycle Facility processed 38,000 fuel elements, produced 366   subassemblies, and assembled 66 control and safety rods. In 1970 alone, nearly   20 reactor manufacturers and research organizations designed experiments based   on EBR-II tests.                                          Argonne Home Page               Frontiers Table of Contents               Next Frontiers Article               Previous Frontiers Article               Comments and Suggestions               Argonne History Index                       In the 1960s, the reactor program was reoriented from water reactors to   liquid-metal-cooled reactors. As the civilian power reactor program began to   focus on the liquid-metal fast-breeder reactor (LMFBR), EBR-II's role changed   to that of a fast-neutron irradiation facility. This was highly unusual -- the   reactor was converted from one mission to another not visualized in its   original design. In essence, the success of the LMFBR was shaped by information   garnered from the converted EBR-II. Ten laboratory units were virtually devoted   to the liquid-metal fast-breeder reactor -- including fast reactor physics,   development and testing of new fuels, irradiation testing, post-irradiation   studies, and fast-reactor safety. In 1965, the testing facility confirmed their   predictions with an initial output of 250 watts of power. Four years later,   1,000 Megawatt studies on LMFBRs had been completed.        By the end of the 1970s, Argonne was geared for fast reactor   development. At Argonne-West, support facilities included, in addition to   EBR-II, the Zero Power Plutonium Reactor; the Transient Reactor Test Facility,   a versatile irradiation tool for producing extreme pulses of nuclear energy   with resulting high temperatures; and the Hot Fuels Examination Facility, which   began operation in 1975 to examine highly radioactive experimental reactor fuel   elements and other components all by remote control.        EBR-II was converted again, beginning in 1982. The next generation   reactor, the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR), was a major initiative in advanced   reactor concepts. The IFR was designed to reprocess its own fuel and to burn up   its own long-lived atomic wastes. The design allowed creation of energy from   waste -- not only its own waste, but also that produced in commercial reactors,   as well as plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons. The passive safety   characteristics of metal fueled liquid metal reactors (LMRs) were clearly   demonstrated and confirmed in 1986 with the conclusion of the Experimental   Breeder Reactor II landmark testing program. Other technical accomplishments   included: development of metal fuels for LMRs capable of very high burnup -- up   to 20 percent; development of electro-metallurgical technology for possible   applications to spent nuclear fuels, weapons plutonium, and LMR fuels; and   performance of a series of safety-related transient reactor experiments which   established the failure mechanisms, failure limits, and post-failure behavior   of oxide and metal LMR fuels.        Work on this next generation of fast reactors -- clean,   resource-efficient, waste-reducing reactors -- was halted by Congress in   September 1994 as the laboratory's mission was redirected by the Department of   Energy into the development of electrometallurgical technology for DOE spent   fuel treatment, reactor and fuel cycle safety, and decontamination and   decommissioning technology.

GX005-95-8821481	Software          for Customized Process Diagnostics         Substantially          cuts system development time          Argonne's  PRODIAG software module substantially cuts system development time, improves diagnostic  accuracy, and expands applications of artificial intelligence diagnostics to many  continuous thermal-hydraulic processes.           By combining artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques with basic thermal-hydraulic          principles, the PRODIAG software environment developed by Argonne researchers          cuts system development time for plant diagnostic systems more than 90%,          improves accuracy, and expands applications of AI diagnostics to many          continuous thermal-hydraulic processes. PRODIAG was cited by  R&D          Magazine as one of the top 100 innovations  of 1998. PRODIAG is one          module of a powerful process transient diagnostic and management system          known as IGENPRO.          PRODIAG and IGENPRO (still under development) differ from other artificial-intelligence          approaches to transient diagnostics and management because they are non-event-based,          reasoning from physical principles rather than from data connected withpreviously          identified events. Accordingly, the codes are far more flexible. They          react well to unanticipated failures and are process-independent, except          for specific piping and instrumentation diagrams. These properties provide          two important benefits. First, customization can be done easily because          there is no need to interview experts; for PRODIAG, system development          time dropped by more than 90% compared with neural network and heuristic-based          diagnostic systems. Second, the process-independent character of IGENPRO          should make it applicable to many thermal-hydraulic systems in industries          ranging from electricity generation, to petrochemicals, to paper.         Originally conceived for nuclear stations, PRODIAG provides a software          environment for developing diagnostic systems that troubleshoot upset          conditions in continuous thermal-hydraulic processes. Such processes are          common in the production of electricity and the manufacture of industrial          products, including paper, glass, petroleum products, and chemicals. PRODIAG's          diagnostic system continuously receives process data -- such as fluid          temperature, pressure, flow, and level -- from the plant and identifies          any failed component that has caused an off-normal plant condition. Examples          include a leak in a heat exchanger, a clogged filter in a piping system,          or the inadvertent opening of a particular valve.         Diagnostic systems developed with PRODIAG have many benefits. The early          detection of process upsets saves labor costs, allows faster recovery,          and limits any release of hazardous material or pollutants. The system          even diagnoses unanticipated failures, whereas systems in current use          react only to situations encoded in their databases.         Argonne's funding for development of PRODIAG and IGENPRO was provided          by the Department of Energy's           (DOE's) Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology, and by DOE's          Energy Research (now the Office of Science), Laboratory Technology Research          Program, under a cooperative research and development agreement with Commonwealth          Research Corporation (Chicago, IL).

But that may change in the near future, at            least in the world of cotton processors, because of work being done            by chemical engineer Val Yachmenev and his colleagues at the  Agricultural            Research Service .                     Yachmenev, who works in the Cotton Textile Chemistry Research            Unit (CTCRU) at ARS' Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans,            Lousiana, has found that ultrasound can boost enzymatic activity during            several different types of treatments to cotton fibers.                     Enzymes are protein molecules that can speed up complex            chemical reactions. They act as catalysts—substances that start            or accelerate chemical reactions without themselves being affected.            Human saliva, for example, contains amylase, an enzyme that helps break            down starchy foods into sugars.                                                 ""Use of enzymes in the cotton industry has become            more popular in recent years,"" says Yachmenev, ""because scientists            have developed highly specific enzymes that perform textile-processing            tasks."" Enzymatic treatments have been used for a long time to            remove the starch size that's added to cotton yarns to smooth and protect            them from breaks during weaving. But new processing applications have            been developed for scouring (removing natural waxes, pectins, and fats            from the surface of cotton fibers), biofinishing (removing fiber fuzz            and pills from fabric surface), and biostoning (removing color and softening            denim fabrics for a stone-washed effect). Enzymes are also used in laundry            detergent, to remove fiber fuzz and various stains, and in bleach cleanup            after scouring to eliminate problems during the dyeing process.                     Yachmenev says that enzymes use significantly less water,            less energy, and fewer chemicals than traditional methods. In addition,            wastewater from enzymatic treatments is readily biodegradable and does            not pose an environmental threat.                     Gene Blanchard, CTCRU's research leader, describes differences            between traditional and enzymatic scouring methods: ""To scour cotton            fibers the old-fashioned way, you boil them in a highly alkaline solution            at temperatures of 100° C. Afterwards, you're left with alkaline            wastewater that must be neutralized with an acid or diluted with large            amounts of fresh water.                                                    ""If you use an enzymatic treatment,"" Blanchard            continues, ""you only have to heat the solution to about 50°            C for optimum enzyme performance. You don't expend as much energy, you            do less damage to the textile, and the resulting wastewater is biodegradable.""                     Although enzymatic processing offers many advantages,            there are a few drawbacks when compared to traditional methods—namely,            expensive processing costs and relatively slow reaction rates. ""These            drawbacks could impede widespread use of enzymes by the textile industry,""            says Yachmenev.                     But ultrasound technology may help make up for enzymatic            processing's shortcomings.            Yachmenev and his SRRC colleagues have found that introducing ultrasonic            energy during enzymatic treatments of cotton fabric significantly improves            enzyme efficiency without affecting the strength of the fabric.           It's In the Bubbles                     Ultrasound can be defined as sound waves with frequencies above 20,000            oscillations per second, which is above the upper limit of human hearing.            In liquid, these high-frequency waves cause the formation of microscopic            bubbles, or cavitation. They also cause insignificant heating of the            liquid.                     When fabric is placed in an enzymatic solution, enzyme molecules, which            are relatively large, make their way to the fabric and are adsorbed            onto the surface. The enzymatic reaction—biostoning, scouring,            etc.—occurs when the enzymes reach the place where solid and liquid            meet, the ""solid/liquid interface.""                     Although this seems like a straightforward process, it can take awhile            because of the enzymes' large size. Yachmenev says, ""These bulky            molecules don't move toward the interface very quickly. And their size            makes it hard for them to penetrate the nearly immobile layer of liquid            that sits right next to the fabric surface.""                     Yachmenev decided that the best way to accelerate the transport of            enzymes through this liquid barrier was to shake things up. He chose            ultrasound as his tool.                     ""Ultrasound causes cavitational bubbles to form in liquid. When            the bubbles collapse, they generate tiny but powerful shock waves. I            knew we needed to agitate the border layer of liquid to get the enzymes            through the barrier more quickly, and these shock waves seemed like            the perfect stirring mechanism,"" he says.                     Some scientists had speculated that ultrasonic energy would be too            powerful to use as a stirring tool—that it would tear apart the            large, yet fragile, enzyme molecules. To prevent this from happening,            Yachmenev and Blanchard diffused the ultrasound energy uniformly through            a solution with low enzyme concentrations.                     The experiment was a success. Enzymatic treatments supplemented with            ultrasonic energy resulted in shorter processing times, less consumption            of expensive enzymes, less fiber damage, and better uniformity of treatment            to the fabric.           Factory-Grade Ultrasound                     All of Yachmenev's experiments were conducted in a laboratory that            houses a small-scale ultrasound machine. Some textile manufacturers            have expressed interest in the technology, but they would need large,            industrial-grade equipment to achieve similar results at the mass-production            level. Unfortunately, most ultrasound manufacturers produce only smaller            machines for the medical and research communities.                     Yachmenev has contacted manufacturers from around the world trying            to generate interest. He says it would be a good investment because            the technology's usefulness isn't limited to just the textile industry.            ""It can be used to intensify enzymatic treatments in any solid/liquid            system,"" he says.                     ""For example, the paper industry would be an excellent candidate            for using ultrasound. Paper producers have had problems in the past            with meeting environmental standards, and they have been moving toward            enzymatic treatments. Ultrasound would make these treatments more cost-effective,""            says Yachmenev.                     ""I believe enzymatic treatments are the wave of the future,""            he continues. ""Governments worldwide are calling for a reduction            in the quantity and toxicity of wastewater, and using enzymes would            help factories and manufacturers achieve this goal. Ultrasound will            help them achieve it at lower costs.""

Studies at PNNL have demonstrated that              carbon dioxide can be successfully used in dyeing, applying UV stabilizer              and for the application and removal of ""size."" Large savings in energy              and reductions in waste generated can be realized by switching to              this ""green"" solvent.                                         Polymeric ""size"" applied to cotton/polyester                    yarn using liquid CO 2                       Traditional textile processing and production are based on aqueous processing.              The use of water as the carrier solvent for processes, such as slashing              (sizing), desizing, dyeing, and finishing, consumes large quantities              of water, results in large energy consumption for drying and results              in large volumes of wastewater requiring treatment. The development              of a nonaqueous based textile processing represents a radical redesign              of the current process. The advantage of re-engineering the process              from the beginning is that a true ""zero discharge"" manufacturing operation              can be achieved through the use of an environmentally benign, ""green""              solvent. Both liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide can be used              as a replacement solvent for water and exploit its property of existing              as a gas at room temperature.                                                                       100% Polyester dyed using supercritical                    CO 2                                     In studies at PNNL, an elegantly simple system comprising a mixture                of CO 2  and dye was used to impregnate polyester                fabric with high loadings of several different color-fast dyes.                In the area of textile sizing/slashing there is an extensive program                at PNNL for using CO 2  technology. In textile                sizing/slashing, the elimination of an aqueous process that requires                repeated drying steps and generates a large wastewater stream has                the potential to significantly reduce operating, material, and energy                costs.

But that may change in the near future, at            least in the world of cotton processors, because of work being done            by chemical engineer Val Yachmenev and his colleagues at the  Agricultural            Research Service .                     Yachmenev, who works in the Cotton Textile Chemistry Research            Unit (CTCRU) at ARS' Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans,            Lousiana, has found that ultrasound can boost enzymatic activity during            several different types of treatments to cotton fibers.                     Enzymes are protein molecules that can speed up complex            chemical reactions. They act as catalysts—substances that start            or accelerate chemical reactions without themselves being affected.            Human saliva, for example, contains amylase, an enzyme that helps break            down starchy foods into sugars.                                                 ""Use of enzymes in the cotton industry has become            more popular in recent years,"" says Yachmenev, ""because scientists            have developed highly specific enzymes that perform textile-processing            tasks."" Enzymatic treatments have been used for a long time to            remove the starch size that's added to cotton yarns to smooth and protect            them from breaks during weaving. But new processing applications have            been developed for scouring (removing natural waxes, pectins, and fats            from the surface of cotton fibers), biofinishing (removing fiber fuzz            and pills from fabric surface), and biostoning (removing color and softening            denim fabrics for a stone-washed effect). Enzymes are also used in laundry            detergent, to remove fiber fuzz and various stains, and in bleach cleanup            after scouring to eliminate problems during the dyeing process.                     Yachmenev says that enzymes use significantly less water,            less energy, and fewer chemicals than traditional methods. In addition,            wastewater from enzymatic treatments is readily biodegradable and does            not pose an environmental threat.                     Gene Blanchard, CTCRU's research leader, describes differences            between traditional and enzymatic scouring methods: ""To scour cotton            fibers the old-fashioned way, you boil them in a highly alkaline solution            at temperatures of 100° C. Afterwards, you're left with alkaline            wastewater that must be neutralized with an acid or diluted with large            amounts of fresh water.                                                    ""If you use an enzymatic treatment,"" Blanchard            continues, ""you only have to heat the solution to about 50°            C for optimum enzyme performance. You don't expend as much energy, you            do less damage to the textile, and the resulting wastewater is biodegradable.""                     Although enzymatic processing offers many advantages,            there are a few drawbacks when compared to traditional methods—namely,            expensive processing costs and relatively slow reaction rates. ""These            drawbacks could impede widespread use of enzymes by the textile industry,""            says Yachmenev.                     But ultrasound technology may help make up for enzymatic            processing's shortcomings.            Yachmenev and his SRRC colleagues have found that introducing ultrasonic            energy during enzymatic treatments of cotton fabric significantly improves            enzyme efficiency without affecting the strength of the fabric.           It's In the Bubbles                     Ultrasound can be defined as sound waves with frequencies above 20,000            oscillations per second, which is above the upper limit of human hearing.            In liquid, these high-frequency waves cause the formation of microscopic            bubbles, or cavitation. They also cause insignificant heating of the            liquid.                     When fabric is placed in an enzymatic solution, enzyme molecules, which            are relatively large, make their way to the fabric and are adsorbed            onto the surface. The enzymatic reaction—biostoning, scouring,            etc.—occurs when the enzymes reach the place where solid and liquid            meet, the ""solid/liquid interface.""                     Although this seems like a straightforward process, it can take awhile            because of the enzymes' large size. Yachmenev says, ""These bulky            molecules don't move toward the interface very quickly. And their size            makes it hard for them to penetrate the nearly immobile layer of liquid            that sits right next to the fabric surface.""                     Yachmenev decided that the best way to accelerate the transport of            enzymes through this liquid barrier was to shake things up. He chose            ultrasound as his tool.                     ""Ultrasound causes cavitational bubbles to form in liquid. When            the bubbles collapse, they generate tiny but powerful shock waves. I            knew we needed to agitate the border layer of liquid to get the enzymes            through the barrier more quickly, and these shock waves seemed like            the perfect stirring mechanism,"" he says.                     Some scientists had speculated that ultrasonic energy would be too            powerful to use as a stirring tool—that it would tear apart the            large, yet fragile, enzyme molecules. To prevent this from happening,            Yachmenev and Blanchard diffused the ultrasound energy uniformly through            a solution with low enzyme concentrations.                     The experiment was a success. Enzymatic treatments supplemented with            ultrasonic energy resulted in shorter processing times, less consumption            of expensive enzymes, less fiber damage, and better uniformity of treatment            to the fabric.           Factory-Grade Ultrasound                     All of Yachmenev's experiments were conducted in a laboratory that            houses a small-scale ultrasound machine. Some textile manufacturers            have expressed interest in the technology, but they would need large,            industrial-grade equipment to achieve similar results at the mass-production            level. Unfortunately, most ultrasound manufacturers produce only smaller            machines for the medical and research communities.                     Yachmenev has contacted manufacturers from around the world trying            to generate interest. He says it would be a good investment because            the technology's usefulness isn't limited to just the textile industry.            ""It can be used to intensify enzymatic treatments in any solid/liquid            system,"" he says.                     ""For example, the paper industry would be an excellent candidate            for using ultrasound. Paper producers have had problems in the past            with meeting environmental standards, and they have been moving toward            enzymatic treatments. Ultrasound would make these treatments more cost-effective,""            says Yachmenev.                     ""I believe enzymatic treatments are the wave of the future,""            he continues. ""Governments worldwide are calling for a reduction            in the quantity and toxicity of wastewater, and using enzymes would            help factories and manufacturers achieve this goal. Ultrasound will            help them achieve it at lower costs.""

GX026-79-1355148	"Return  to the Main Document    1. INTRODUCTION   To evaluate the postclosure performance of a potential monitored geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, a total system performance assessment (TSPA) will be conducted.  A set of nine process model reports (PMRs), of which this document is one, is being developed to summarize the technical basis for each of the process models supporting the TSPA model.  These reports cover the following areas:      Integrated Site Model   Unsaturated Zone Flow and Transport   Near Field Environment   Engineered Barrier System Degradation, Flow, and Transport   Waste Package Degradation   Waste Form Degradation   Saturated Zone Flow and Transport   Biosphere   Disruptive Events.     These PMRs are supported by analysis model reports (AMRs) that contain the more detailed technical information to be input into each PMR and the TSPA.  This technical information consist of data, analyses, models, software, and supporting documentation that will be used to defend the applicability of each process model for its intended purpose of evaluating the postclosure performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository system.  The methodology used to develop AMRs and PMRs is designed to ensure traceability of information.  Its final use in the TSPA is intended to ensure that the data are the best available when the TSPA is performed.    1.1 OBJECTIVE  The degradation and potential release of the radioactive waste placed into the potential Yucca Mountain repository are dependent on numerous features 1 , events 2 , and processes 3  (FEPs) of the disposal system.  Because of the different spatial and time scales and the large number of FEPs, they have been grouped into several modeling systems and components for modeling and discussion in reports.  The overall objective of the  Waste Form Degradation Process Modeling Report  (Waste Form Degradation PMR) is to summarize the technical basis of the Waste Form Degradation model.  The degradation of the waste eventually leads to mobilization of radionuclides and release into other components of the engineered barrier system (EBS) in the TSPA.  Because a small fraction of the radioisotope in the waste can be transported through the EBS and the natural rock barrier, the source concentrations of radionuclides evaluated by the Waste Form Degradation Model can influence results of the TSPA analysis when the waste package (WP) is breached.  This TSPA analysis, in turn, is an important basis of the Site Recommendation Consideration Report (SRCR) and, thus, designated as TSPA-SR in this report.    1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE   Nineteen AMRs were written to document (1) various experimental results, (2) conceptual models and detailed numerical models, and (3) further abstraction of the experiments or numerical models and to define consistent model parameters pertinent to degradation of the waste form.  The purpose and scope of the Waste Form Degradation PMR is to summarize the most important aspects of these 19 AMRs to provide a coherent view of the components of the Waste Form Degradation Model.  More specifically, in order to satisfy several important requirements for the analysis for the TSPA-SR according to the DOE interim guidance  (Dyer 1999 ) to the proposed U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulation (proposed DOE 10 CFR 63.114 Interim Guidance [ Dyer 1999 ]), Waste Form Degradation PMR purpose and scope are to briefly summarize:       The technical basis for either including or excluding FEPs influencing the degradation, deterioration, and alteration of the waste form    The technical basis for the models (usually the experimental foundation but occasionally comparison with more detailed modeling or natural analogs) used to evaluate FEPs thought to significantly influence the degradation of the waste form      The technical basis for bounding values or probability distributions of parameters of the corresponding components    The relationship of the FEPs to particular key technical issues (KTIs) that have been raised by the NRC in their IRSRs–particularly the Container Life and Source Term (CLST) IRSR.   The numerical results of the Waste Form Degradation Model as implemented in the analysis for the TSPA-SR are not discussed here.  These results will be found in documentation of the analysis for the TSPA-SR.  Hence, the features of the waste form that are definitely considered barriers important to waste isolation are not identified here.  Rather these identified features will be found in the TSPA-SR, the SRCR, and future versions of the Repository Safety Strategy (RSS) ( CRWMS M&O 2000a ).    1.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE  The Quality Assurance (QA) program applies to this PMR and the AMRs that support it. The development of this analysis is conducted under activity evaluation  Waste Form Analysis & Models  ( CRWMS M&O 2000b ), which was prepared per  AP-2.16Q ,  Activity Evaluation .  The results of that evaluation were that the activity is subject to the  Quality Assurance Requirements and Description  ( DOE 2000 ) requirements.   This report has a formal planning document ( CRWMS M&O 2000c ). Development of this report did not involve the electronic management of data.  The purpose of this ICN is to address DOE comments.   This report was prepared in accordance with  AP-3.11Q ,  Technical Reports  and reviewed in accordance with  AP-2.14Q ,  Review of Technical Products .  The Waste Form Degradation PMR does not serve as a primary source for data, models, and codes described in the AMRs related to waste form degradation; this function is provided by the AMRs themselves.  The AMRs supporting the Waste Form Degradation PMR were prepared in accordance with  AP-3.10Q ,  Analyses and Models , including  AP-3.15Q ,  Managing Technical Product Inputs , for data verification,  AP-SIII.2Q ,  Qualification of Unqualified Data and the Documentation of Rationale for Accepted Data , for data qualification and  AP-SI.1Q ,  Software Management , for management of software.  The quality assurance documentation of the models, codes, and data is deferred to the AMRs cited in this document.  The current quality status of data and software can be found in the Document Input Reference System (DIRS).   This PMR includes the results from software codes and routines used in the supporting AMRs.  However no software codes were used in the development of this PMR. The following statements are presented for information only. The only software code used in the AMRs was the EQ3/6 package, Version 7.2b, which was approved for QA work by LLNL and is identified as Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI):  UCRL-MA-110662 V 7.2b ( CRWMS M&O 1998a ) and its addendum ( CRWMS M&O 1999c ).  The package was used both for chemical equilibrium calculations, and reaction path calculations (see  Sections 3.2  and  3.7 ).    1.4 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROJECT REPORTS   The Waste Form Degradation PMR describes how information is used in the TSPA-SR analysis by summarizing the modeling components of the Waste Form Degradation Model.  Although not directly coupled, the Waste Form Degradation Model, in turn, is related to the Waste Package Degradation Model and Engineered Barrier System Model and their corresponding PMRs:  Waste Package Degradation PMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000d ) and Engineered Barrier System PMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000y ).  The Waste Form Degradation PMR is also related to the Disruptive Events PMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000an ) since it requires waste inventory information.  Eight summary/abstraction AMRs specifically support the Waste Form Degradation PMR ( Figure 1.4-1 ).  Other documents underlying these primary areas are mentioned within Chapter 3.

Many of these models are components of larger models that, in turn, are models to system-level models.  Rather than call all the parts ""models,"" this report uses terms that identify the hierarchy of the models to help orient the reader.  The system-level model, which uses total system simulation software, is referred to as the ""TSPA-SR system-level model"" or ""TSPA-SR.""  The major parts of TSPA-SR are referred to as ""models.""  The Waste Form Degradation Model is one such model.  The models and analyses that are parts of the Waste Form Degradation Model are referred to as ""components.""  (A possible alternative term is ""submodel."" However, not all the parts are models in the sense used by YMP but rather are analyses, so the term ""components"" was selected.)  Although the Waste Form Degradation PMR has several broad purposes already listed, one important purpose is to describe the Waste Form Degradation Model in the TSPA-SR and its underlying components.    1.5.1 Function of Waste Form Degradation Model   Within the analysis for the TSPA-SR analysis, the function of the Waste Form Degradation Model is to determine three outputs over time:  (1) dissolved concentration, (2) reversible colloidal concentration, and (3) irreversible colloidal concentration of radionuclides ( Figure 1.5-1 ).   Numerous inputs are required for the Waste Form Degradation Model.  Several inputs are intimately tied with the waste form degradation models such as initial cladding condition and thermodynamic data for radionuclides. They are summarized in this report.  Other inputs are summarized in other PMRs.  For example, the time dependent seepage flow into the WP and WP surface temperatures are summarized in the EBS PMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000y ).  Corrosion rates of the inner stainless steel container and supports for waste inside the waste package are summarized in the Waste Package Degradation PMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000d ).    1.5.2 Components of Waste Form Degradation Model   To determine the three output radioisotope concentrations, the Waste Form Degradation Model uses eight major modeling/analysis components to evaluate the degradation, deterioration, or alteration of the waste: (1) Radioisotope Inventory (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000f ), (2) In-Package Chemistry (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000g ), (3) Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel (CSNF) Matrix Degradation (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000h ), (4) CSNF Cladding Degradation (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000i ), (5) DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel (DSNF) Degradation (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000j ), (6) High-Level Waste (HLW) Degradation (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000k ), (7) Radioisotope Dissolved Concentration (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000l ), and (8) Radioisotope Colloidal Concentration (described in  CRWMS M&O 2000m ) ( Figure 1.4-1 ).   The mathematical description of these eight components is one specific purpose of the Waste Form Degradation PMR.  Another important purpose is to summarize the technical bases of the eight components.  Generally, the primary technical bases or ""foundations"" of the eight components of the waste form degradation models are the CSNF, DSNF, and HLW degradation experiments described throughout the report.    1.5.3 Major Models Communicating with Waste Form Degradation Models within TSPA-SR Analysis   For TSPA-SR analysis, the major model communication with the Waste Form Degradation Model is from the EBS abstraction models and the TSPA ( Figure 1.5-2 ).  The EBS abstraction models determine the water seepage quantity onto the waste form that is used by both the In-Package Chemistry Component and the Dissolved Radioisotope Concentration Components.  In turn, the Waste Form Degradation Model determines dissolved and colloidal concentrations of radionuclides for the EBS.  The Waste Form Degradation Model is also uncoupled from the Waste Package Degradation Model.  Although conceptually, the Waste Package Degradation Model could calculate the rate iron oxides or other corrosion products are produced by the degradation of the WP and pass this information onto the Waste Form Degradation Model.  Instead of this communication, the underlying in-package process model evaluated the resulting chemistry from a variety of corrosion rates and expressed this as uncertainty in the final in-package Chemistry Component.    1.5.4 Linkage of Components in Waste Form Degradation Model   The components of the Waste Form Degradation Model are generally connected sequentially starting with the Radioisotope Inventory Component and ending with the Radioisotope Colloidal Concentration Component; however, some complications occur.  First, the rates of degradation of the three general categories of waste forms modeled (CSNF, DSNF, and HLW) are not coupled, and so three different paths through the Waste Form Degradation Model are possible ( Figure 1.5-3 ).  Furthermore, because the in-package chemistry (primarily pH) is dependent upon the amount of CSNF exposed and the rate of alteration of the borosilicate glass of the HLW, some minor feedback does occur.  Because the feedback is minor (i.e., secondary effect), the feedback lags by one timestep (i.e., the Waste Form Degradation Model does not iterate during the timestep).    1.6 Principal and other factors considered   The magnitude of the YMP and the complexities associated with both the natural and EBSs dictate that the YMP prioritize its activities and focus on the factors most important to performance, hereafter named the principal factors.  The Repository Safety Strategy (RSS) ( CRWMS M&O 2000a , Table 3-1) has identified seven principal factors and 18 other factors of lesser importance.  The selection of the principal factors has been based on preliminary TSPA analyses and expert judgment, which identified these factors as likely to provide sufficient confidence for the safety case.  The other factors were deemed to be less important to the safety case, nevertheless requiring representation in the current methodology ( CRWMS M&O 2000a ,  Section 3.1 ).   Table 1.6-1  lists the seven principal factors, the 18 other factors, and the PMRs that address each.  The Waste Form Degradation PMR addresses the principal factor Solubility Limits of Dissolved Radionuclides.   Solubility Limits of Dissolved Radionuclides is a principal factor because it describes the limitation to the mobilization of the relatively immobile radionuclides because of their limited solubilities in the water at Yucca Mountain.  Some of these radionuclides present significant risk potential because of the long half-life and large dose conversion factor. In many cases, the solubilities of these radionuclides are so low they present no significant issue for the potential repository system.  However, there are a few cases, notably neptunium, plutonium, and uranium isotopes, for which solubility limits could be very important to the postclosure safety case ( CRWMS M&O 2000a , Section 3.2.4).   In addition, the following six other factors are within the scope of the Waste Form Degradation PMR.       Environment within the WP ( Section 3.2 )      CSNF waste form performance ( Section 3.3  and  3.4 )      HLW glass waste form performance  (Section 3.5 )      DSNF, naval SNF, Pu-disposition waste form performance ( Section 3.6 )      Colloid-associated radionuclide concentrations ( Section 3.8 )     In-package radionuclide transport ( Section 3.2.1.2 ).     The general guidelines for addressing these other factors were to use conservative bounding analysis, when possible.  Principal factors are studied and evaluated more thoroughly, using both rigorous, realistic numerical evaluations and also conservative bounding analyses if warranted by the overall site performance.     1.7 Organization of Report   Chapter 2 discusses the evolution of the Waste Form Degradation Model from past TSPA analysis and the formal screening of FEPs to include in the current model.  The major portion of this report, Chapter 3, discusses the inner workings and technical basis of the eight main components of the Waste Form Degradation Model used in the TSPA-SR analysis.  The order of discussion for the eight components reflects the direction of data flow between components ( Figure 1.5-3 ).  Each section of Chapter 3 begins with an introduction to the component.  This introduction includes a listing of the AMRs and calculations that provide the detailed technical basis for that component, and an overview of the conceptual model as appropriate.  The description sub-section, which follows, includes summaries of (1) the descriptions of the analysis, models, and/or abstractions, (2) relevant data and uncertainties, (3) assumptions and basis, and (4) model results.  The amount of detail provided varies with each component.  For many components, the results are simply the models and parameters provided to the TSPA-SR and are, thus, included in the model/analysis abstraction description.  In addition, many times, the relevant data and uncertainties are only briefly summarized, and the reader is referred to the supporting AMRs for detailed discussion.  The Confidence/Limitations/Validation sub-section includes a discussion of model limitations, the justification and confidence, and validation that the component is appropriate for the intended use (i.e., appropriate as support for making a recommendation on the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a repository).  Each component section ends with a sub-section, which summarizes alternative models and/or addresses known issues posed by groups that have project oversight, regulatory oversight, or stakeholder interfaces with the YMP.  The last section of Chapter 3,  Section 3.9,  tabulates these issues for all eight components, and provides cross-references to the component sections.  Chapter 4 of the report summarizes the relationship of the topics of this report with the NRC IRSRs, primarily the CLST KTIs.  Chapter 5 is a brief summary of the report.    2. EVOLUTION OF WASTE FORM DEGRADATION MODEL   The waste form degradation models have generally evolved over the years along with the overall TSPA model of the disposal system.  Thus, this section first presents a short summary of the evolution of the TSPAs of the Yucca Mountain disposal system by the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP), followed by a summary of the evolution of various components in the Waste Form Degradation Model.  More detail is presented along with each major section of the various components.    2.1 GENERAL HISTORY OF ASSESSMENTS OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN PERFORMANCE   As summarized by  Rechard (1999) , simple analytic calculations to determine the relative importance of various phenomena postulated to occur at Yucca Mountain were conducted in 1984 (which identified  99 Tc,  129 I, and  237 Np as important radionuclides for evaluating compliance) ( Sinnock et al. 1984 ) and 1988 (performed in conjunction with the Site Characterization Plan (SCP) ( DOE 1988 , Section 8.3.5.13).  The first large-scale analysis of water movement through the unsaturated zone occurred in 1990 ( Prindle and Hopkins 1990 ).  Shortly thereafter, a series of deterministic calculations using best estimates for model parameters were run by several organizationsSandia National Laboratories, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratoryto simulate the radioisotope transport in the unsaturated zone ( Barnard and Dockery 1991 ).     In 1992, the YMP completed the first probabilistic TSPA of the potential Yucca Mountain disposal system to evaluate releases to a 5-km boundary.  Two different organizations conducted total system performance analysis:  Sandia National Laboratories (TSPA-91-SNL) ( Barnard et al. 1992 ) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (TSPA-91-PNNL) ( Eslinger et al. 1993 ).  For the first time, gaseous flow of  14 C was included.  In this first probabilistic assessment, the YMP was at a relatively early stage in conceptual model development; thus, parameter values and distributions were determined primarily by individual PA analysts.   In 1993, a second iteration of the SNL TSPA (TSPA-93-SNL) ( Wilson et al. 1994 ) was started that included an improved Waste Form Degradation Model (called source-term model) and a saturated zone model.  The analysis also greatly expanded the data used for defining geochemical parameters.  The formality increased as well in that distributions for many more parameters were developed and more often based on the consensus of several PA analysts, accompanied by input from site characterization scientists.   In 1993, the newly assigned CRWMS M&O also conducted a TSPA (TSPA-93-Duke) ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ) using the Repository Integration Program (RIP) modeling system intended to rapidly simulate the behavior of the disposal system to evaluate design systems.  The system used a variety of techniques such as curve fits to previous results and selection of distributions for particular data to incorporate previous results.    This simplified modeling style, called abstraction, had been originally proposed in the 1988 SCP ( DOE 1988 , Chapter 8, Section 8.3.5.13) as the culmination of sensitivity analysis on process models. The analyses using RIP were the only TSPAs performed by CRWMS M&O after 1993.  The basic information on parameter distributions reported in TSPA-93-SNL ( Wilson et al. 1994 ) was used for TSPA-93-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ) and subsequent TSPAs in 1995, 1996, and 1997 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ;  CRWMS M&O 1996a ;  CRWMS M&O 1996b ;  CRWMS M&O 1997a ); although some differences did occur for radionuclide inventory, and other parameter values were sometimes changed for parametric sensitivity analysis.  Besides TSPAs conducted specifically by CRWMS M&O for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Office of DOE (DOE/RW/YMSCO), TSPAs conducted specifically for the National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP) of the Office of Environmental Management of DOE (DOE/EM) by SNL in 1993, 1995, and 1998 examined the behavior of DSNF to test the viability of direct disposal of the waste in salt, granite, and tuff (DSNF-TSPA-93-SNL) ( Rechard 1993 ), DSNF-TSPA-94-SNL ( Rechard 1995 ), DSNF-TSPA-98-SNL) ( DOE 1998a ;  Rechard 1993 ,  1995 ).  The analysis included the effects of cladding since this was an important feature that distinguished ~250 types of DSNF and CSNF.  The NSNFP also contracted with CRWMS M&O to conduct similar analysis in 1997 for DSNF, DSNF-TSPA-97-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1997a ).  The CRWMS M&O had done a similar sensitivity study the year before on the disposal of excess weapons and plutonium ( CRWMS M&O 1996b ).  In 1998, NSNFP supported CRWMS M&O such that DSNF was included as a sensitivity study in the TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) (viability assessment) technical basis document discussed below ( CRWMS M&O 1998b ).  In 1997, Congress mandated in its energy appropriation bill that the YMP provide a viability assessment that (along with a preliminary design and costs estimates for constructing and operating that design) would include a TSPA describing the probable behavior of the potential Yucca Mountain disposal system ( Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act 1997 ).  A TSPA-VA was thus initiated and completed in November 1998 ( DOE 1998b ).  For TSPA-VA, numerous changes and additions were made to the TSPA-95 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ) models, including the addition of more phenomena.  Some of these changes included the influence of the Zircaloy cladding on CSNF, evaluation and inclusion of geochemistry changes near the waste package, colloid formation and transport, and a factor of 100 reduction in solubility of Np ( DOE 1998b ;  CRWMS M&O 1997b ;  CRWMS M&O 1998b ).     2.2 EVOLUTION OF EACH MODEL COMPONENT   A brief history of the evolution of the waste form models and components is discussed.      Radioisotope Inventory Component ( Section 3.1 )     Many of the early assessments in the 1990s used the inventory for CSNF developed around the time of the 1988 SCP: the DOE Characteristics Data Base of 1987.   TSPA-93-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ) used the DOE Characteristics Data Base of 1987 to evaluate the inventory of CSNF and HLW and screen radionuclides.   TSPA-95 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ) used the DOE Characteristics Data Base of 1992; the weighted average burnup (BU) was slightly lower than TSPA-93-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ) (36,666 versus 39,075 megawatt days [MWd]/metric tons of heavy metal [MTHM]); nine radionuclides were tracked in TSPA-95.  The screening criteria for the radioisotope selection were based on the maximum release rates allowed in  10 CFR 60 .   TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) used the same inventory information as TSPA-95 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ).  Inventories for sixteen DSNF groups (supplied by NSNFP), naval fuel (supplied by the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program), and immobilized plutonium from the disposition of excess weapons were not included in the base case analysis but were considered in separate sensitivity analysis ( CRWMS M&O 1998b , Section 6.2.1). Releases from naval SNF were found to be insignificant.   TSPA-SR analysis uses updated values ( CRWMS M&O 2000f ) for the CSNF inventory based on internal documents, DSNF inventory based on a report of eleven groups supplied by NSNFP ( DOE 1999b ), HLW inventory based on the draft EIS ( DOE 1999a , Section A.2.1), and immobilized plutonium based on the draft EIS ( DOE 1999a , Section A.2.3). This evaluation includes the trend toward higher burnup fuels in utility operation.      In-Package Chemistry Component ( Section 3.2 )      Through 1997, the effects of in-package chemistry on degradation of the waste form and solubility of radionuclides were incorporated through judgement when assigning a parameter value or distribution, or through use of conservatively bounded models.  This resulted in wide distribution ranges for many parameters.  Sensitivity analyses suggested that application of chemically dependent models could reduce uncertainty and conservatism.    TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) evaluated chemistry of the water potentially entering a waste package based on the water flux and presence of a degraded concrete liner for several input conditions.  The results were then collapsed into two time periods and used to guide the selection of solubility for a few radionuclides ( CRWMS M&O 1998b ).  This ""two group"" chemistry was dominated by the concrete liner, but allowed further sensitivity assessment for the effect of chemical conditions within the EBS.    For TSPA-SR analysis, the Waste Form Degradation Model has an In-Package Chemistry Component that was coupled with the seepage rate of water into the package and degradation of the steel, aluminum, SNF, and HLW inside the package.  The TSPA-SR analysis design does not have a concrete liner that dominates the chemistry, therefore processes at the surface of waste package materials and waste forms control the range of chemistry.  The estimated minimum pH after breach of the container was lower than was considered in previous TSPAs.  Results from the In-Package Chemistry influenced degradation of the CSNF cladding and matrix, solubility, and colloid availability and stability.  The degradation of HLW and exposed amount of CSNF, in turn, influenced the In-Package Chemistry ( Figure 1.5-3 ).      CSNF Matrix Degradation Component ( Section 3.3 )      Early performance assessments bound CSNF oxidation and dissolution rates by experimental observations.  Testing of UO 2  and spent fuel has included elevated temperature air oxidation, aqueous dissolution at high water flow rates, and in aqueous dissolution batch reactors.  Because of the possibility for early waste package failure, high temperatures, and no modeling of cladding performance, dry oxidation of the fuel matrix to more soluble forms was an important consideration in early assessments.  Aqueous dissolution is observed to be temperature and pH dependent.  Carbonate ions can influence the surface reaction rate, and at high rates and limited oxygen availability the rate may be bounded by P O2 .  Burnup dependence includes a combination of effects from radiation, fission products and thermal alteration of the matrix.   Since TSPA-93-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ), empirical dissolution rates have been based on experimental data.   For TSPA-95, a simplified regression equation based on T, pH, PO2, [CO3]T was used, based on high flow rate experiments to provide a upper bound on dissolution rate.   After TSPA-95, the fuel test program was expanded to include aqueous dissolution at very low drip rates to represent the slow seepage conditions indicated as most likely to occur in an unsaturated repository.   For TSPA-VA, an eleven term regression equation dependent on temperature (T), pH, total carbonate concentration [CO3]T , oxygen partial pressure (as percent of atmosphere) (PO2), burnup of the fuel, and several cross-product terms was used.  This equation was based on high flow rate dissolution experiments, and thus represents an upper bound.  The longevity of the VA waste package and inclusion of cladding performance resulted in protection of the fuel matrix until temperatures were low enough that dry oxidation was no longer an important process.  A more detailed chemistry dependence was included to allow sensitivity analyses to evaluate the value of tracking chemical condition within the EBS.  The collection of radionuclides in secondary phases, as seen in the drip tests was considered in a sensitivity study.   For TSPA-SR analysis, a simplified regression equation based only on T, pH, P O2 , [CO 3 ] T  was used and these controlling variables were coupled to in-package chemistry to account for uncertainty.  The model is based on data from the high flow rate experiments and represents an upper bound for the dissolution rate.      CSNF Cladding Degradation Component ( Section 3.4 )     While fuel cladding is very corrosion resistant, it is thin and used in a harsh reactor environment.  Because of these concerns, cladding was not considered in early assessments.  Cladding degradation testing and modeling has evolved and is used as a basis for extending the period of wet and dry storage and for licensing shipping casks for spent fuel.  This information has accumulated in the literature.  Development of long lived waste packages that protect the fuel during the early thermal transient, along with the accumulated literature, has allowed consideration of cladding in repository performance.   Cladding degradation was first considered in DSNF-TSPA-93-SNL ( Rechard 1993 ) and DSNF-TSPA-94-SNL ( Rechard 1995 ) to distinguish performance of various SNF ( Rechard 1993 ,  1995 ;  DOE 1998a ); the cladding was divided into two classes, failed and intact cladding; the degradation of intact cladding was based on Arrhenius type rate equation and a reduction factor to account for localized corrosion.   For TSPA-95, cladding degradation from creep rupture was discussed but not used in the analysis, and the fuel was considered to be bare.   For TSPA-VA, several cladding degradation modes (initial reactor failures, creep rupture, failures from rockfall, and localized corrosion as estimated by a zirconium model within the waste package degradation model, WAPDEG) were combined into a time-varying function of failed cladding.  Other cladding modes such as cladding unzipping, stress corrosion cracking, and hydride failures (hydride embrittlement, delayed hydride cracking [DHC] and hydride reorientation) were not considered likely to occur and were omitted from consideration.   For TSPA-SR analysis, cladding degradation was coupled to CSNF Matrix Degradation and In-Package Chemistry; furthermore, two steps of degradation were included: perforation and unzipping.  The modes of cladding degradation were formally evaluated during FEP screening; hydride failures were still omitted from consideration.      DSNF Degradation Component ( Section 3.5 )     DSNF was first considered in DSNF-TSPA-93-SNL ( Rechard 1993 ) and DSNF-TSPA-94-SNL ( Rechard 1995 ).  An Arrhenius-type rate equation was used for degradation except that each of the various types of DSNF used different model parameters.    CRWMS M&O studied the sensitivity of DSNF in 1997.   TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) studied the sensitivity of DSNF in 1998; the degradation rate of N-Reactor SNF was used to bound the response of all other waste types; the rate equation was that developed for DSNF-TSPA-94-SNL ( Rechard 1995 ).   In an analysis to support TSPA-SR, DSNF (with the exception of naval SNF) was included using N-Reactor SNF to represent the physical degradation rate; however, the inventory was the weighted sum of all waste types included in the DSNF allocation category.  The degradation rate of N-Reactor SNF was a bound on the maximum degradation rate observed to date in on-going experiments ( Gray and Einziger 1998 ).      HLW Degradation Component ( Section 3.6 )     Early assessments were based on bounds of observed glass dissolution rates.  Initially short-term, aqueous batch testing was done for developing glass mixtures and evaluating product consistency.  Later, long term batch and high flow rate testing was done to obtain long term reaction rate.   A separate degradation rate for HLW was first included in TSPA-93-SNL and TSPA-93-Duke ( CRWMS M&O 1994 ) and afterwards.   For TSPA-VA, a phenomenological model of degradation was used where several parameters were based on experimental data; a few variables were set at fixed values (e.g., silica concentration).  Development of long lived waste packages reduced the importance of higher temperature processes.   For TSPA-SR analysis, bounds on parameters of a phenomenological model were used to develop a simplified (Arrhenius-type) rate equation of degradation.  The parameter values in this model are based on laboratory test results for a range of reference glass compositions and are designed to conservatively bound the rate of glass corrosion under the range of conditions (immersion, humid air and dripping groundwater) to which it may be exposed in the repository.  Specifically, the model is now designed to bound the higher corrosion rates observed after extensive reaction progress in some laboratory tests and also bounds the corrosion rates observed under vapor hydration and dripping groundwater conditions.      Dissolved Radioisotope Concentration Component ( Section 3.7 )     Early assessments assumed conservative upper bounds on aqueous solubility.   For TSPA-93-SNL, an elicitation of project experts was used in 1993 to determine solubility of important radionuclides.   TSPA-95 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ) generally used the values of TSPA-93-SNL; however, some values were modified based on experimental observations and controlling processes and phase assumptions.   TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) used the values of TSPA-95 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ) except Np solubility was reduced by factor of 100 after reevaluating previous experiments.   In TSPA-SR analysis, solubility of important radionuclides (as determined by updated screening) was reevaluated.  Three radioisotope solubilities were abstracted as a direct function of in-package chemistry (Np, U, Am) to better account for the uncertainty.  Four radioisotope solubilities were defined by a probability distribution, and all others were set at bounding values.      Colloidal Radioisotope Concentration Component ( Section 3.8 )      Early assessments used wide ranges on solubility that bounded the potential effect of colloidal transport of specific radionuclides since experimental data and colloid formation, stability and transport models were limited.    Colloids first incorporated as a radioisotope transport mechanism in TSPA-VA.  Colloid formation, stability, and transport properties were inferred from glass and fuel dissolution tests, field observations, and laboratory experiments.   Colloid model incorporates new details for TSPA-SR.        2.3 SCREENING OF FEATURES, EVENTS, AND PROCESSES    2.3.1 Screening Criteria  Throughout the 20 years of analysis of the potential Yucca Mountain disposal system, various FEPs have been identified and their influence on the disposal system evaluated.  The FEPs have been identified by a variety of methods, such as hypothesis by scientists and engineers working on the project or through review of their work.  The variety of project participants and reviewers have helped ensure that a wide variety of FEPs has been considered.  These hypotheses and reviews have been the impetus for the changes and evolution of the models discussed above. An initial set of FEPs was created for TSPA-SR analysis by combining three general lists of FEPs:  82 from various YMP workshops in 1998 and 1999, 292 FEPs gathered from YMP literature and site studies, and 1,412 FEPs from a draft report of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for a total of 1,786 FEPs.  The latter list is a compilation of FEPs from seven geologic repository programs in other countries and, thus, the most complete attempt internationally to develop a comprehensive list of FEPs relevant to radioactive waste disposal.    To ensure the list was comprehensive, all potentially relevant FEPs identified have been included; however, this list has led to considerable redundancy.  Consequently, late in 1998, the FEPs were classified as either primary or secondary.  The 310 primary FEPs are those FEPs for which detailed screening arguments are developed.  The remaining 1,476 secondary FEPs are either completely redundant or can be reasonably aggregated and mapped into a single primary FEP through modification of the description the primary FEP.   To develop screening arguments, the primary FEPs have been assigned to applicable PMRs. However, since a FEP can effect many facets of the disposal system, a FEP may be assigned to several PMRs.  For example, some FEPs that affect the degradation of waste form also influence the waste package degradation and the evolution of the Engineered Barrier System and, thus, have been assigned to all three corresponding PMRs.    The 87 primary waste form FEPs assigned to the Waste Form Degradation PMR have been evaluated by subject-matter experts and discussed in three different AMRs:  57 primary waste form FEPs are discussed in  Miscellaneous Waste-Form FEPs  ( CRWMS M&O 2000n , Table 1), 15 are discussed in  Waste Form Colloid-Associated Concentrations Limits:  Abstraction and Summary  ( CRWMS M&O 2000m , Attachments I through XV), and 16 are discussed in  Clad DegradationFEPs Screening Arguments  ( CRWMS M&O 2000s ). One FEP (Mutation) appears in two AMRs ( CRWMS M&O 2000n ,  CRWMS M&O 2000m ).   The decision to include or exclude a FEP related to the waste form was based on two criteria in the NRCs proposed rule 10 CFR 63.114 ( Dyer 1999 ) 4 .      ""Consider only events that have at least one chance in 10,000 of occurring over 10,000 years"" (Section 63.114(d)).   ""Provide the technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers in the performance assessment, including those processes that would adversely affect the performance of natural barriers.  Degradation, deterioration, or alteration processes of engineered barriers must be evaluated in detail if the magnitude and time of the resulting expected annual dose would be significantly changed by their omission"" (Section 63.114(f)).     In accordance with its proposed rule ( Dyer 1999 ), the NRC provides additional guidance in the TSPAI IRSR ( NRC 2000a ) on the screening process to follow to exclude FEPs.  The guidance states four criteria that will be used ( NRC 2000a , Section 4.2.3), with the first three criteria dealing with evaluating the probability of the FEP:      ""Criterion T1:  Categories of processes and events that are not credible for the YM repository because of waste characteristics ... are identified and sufficient justification is provided for DOEs conclusions.""   ""Criterion T2:  The probability assigned to each category of processes and events not screened based on criterion T1 or criterion T2 is consistent with site information, well documented, and appropriately considers uncertainty.""   ""Criterion T3:  DOE has demonstrated that processes and events screened from the PA on the basis of their probability of occurrence, have a probability of less that one chance in 10,000 of occurring over 10,000 years.""   ""Criterion T4:  DOE has demonstrated that categories of processes and events omitted from the PA on the basis that their omission would not significantly change the calculated expected annual dose, do not significantly change the calculated expected annual dose.""     In summary, the first criterion permits an exclusion argument for FEPs that are not credible because of waste characteristics, repository design, or site characteristics.  The second and third criteria deal with the assignment of probabilities to FEPs and demonstrating that the probabilities of excluded FEPs are below the quantitative probability limit of 10 -4  over 10 4  yr.  The fourth criterion permits exclusion of FEPs that do not significantly change the calculated expected annual dose.  These exclusions must be adequately justified in accompanying discussions or calculations, including the use of either bounding or representative estimates.  In applying the fourth criterion, calculations of intermediate results are often used instead of dose calculations. For example, if a FEP does not affect release from the waste packages, it will not affect dose, so it is sufficient to consider release alone.   Based on the four criteria stated above, a statement on whether to Include or Exclude the FEP is provided. If the screening decision is Include, the FEP is considered either in the nominal scenario (i.e., the scenario that contains all expected FEPs and no disruptive 5  FEPs), in a disruptive scenario (i.e., any scenario that contains all expected FEPs and one or more disruptive FEPs), or in the human intrusion scenario.   Because the primary FEPs are the coarsest aggregate suitable for analysis, situations may result in which a given primary FEP contains some secondary FEPs that are Include and some that are Exclude.  In these situations, the screening decision specifies which elements are Include and which are Exclude.   2.3.2 Screening Decisions   Most of the waste form FEPs that have been excluded from further consideration were excluded based on low consequence.  Several waste form FEPs have been excluded based on the FEP not being credible for the waste characteristics and repository design at Yucca Mountain.  For the discussion herein, the 87 FEPs have been grouped and tabulated according to the eight major modeling components of the waste degradation model ( Figure 2.3-1 ).  Each of the eight tables provides the YMP FEP number, the short title, the decision as to whether to include or exclude the FEP, the PMRs where the FEP was discussed, the AMR that provides the full argument for the screening decision related to the waste form, and a brief synopsis of the screening argument.  The synopsis only pertains to the Waste Form Degradation PMR.  The reasoning to include or exclude a FEP in relation to other PMRs is not given but can be found in those other PMRs or the underlying AMR.   Several waste form FEPs have been excluded because the FEP is not credible for the characteristics of the waste proposed for disposal at Yucca Mountain (i.e., first criterion, T1).  The succinct description for this reasoning is ""Excluded based on low probability (credibility).""  For example, cellulosic material is not present in CSNF, DSNF, or HLW that would be disposed of at Yucca Mountain;  furthermore, organic material will be excluded based on current waste acceptance criteria.  Therefore, FEP 2.1.02.10.00 in  Table 2.3-2  that discusses this feature of the waste is excluded based on a low probability (credibility) argument.   No FEPs were excluded based on quantitatively evaluating the probability of a FEP (i.e., criteria T2 and T3).  Rather, most of the excluded FEPs related to the waste form were excluded based on the fourth criterion (T4), ""no significant change in the expected annual dose."" FEPs excluded based on this criterion are succinctly described as ""Excluded based on low consequence.""  For example, generation of H 2  is credible in an anoxic environment when steel corrodes; yet, it is unlikely that much will be produced since the drifts at Yucca Mountain will be mostly oxic.  Only in small pores and crevices would an anoxic environment be found in the waste.  Because evaluating a probability for this phenomenon is very difficult, the low consequences of this phenomenon were used to exclude this FEP.  H 2 , if produced, is very mobile and kinetically unreactive at low temperatures, so it is expected to leave the drift before it reacts with any of the emplaced materials.  In addition, oxidation of hydronium ion to H 2  instead of sulfur to sulfate results in less pH suppression.   The latter reason is a minor aspect of the argument to exclude the process, but in other FEPs it can be a major aspect of the argument because bounding estimates are often used in the TSPA-SR.  That is, the argument for exclusion is often that the exclusion of the FEP provides a bound on the expected annual dose (i.e., inclusion of the FEP would only decrease the expected annual dose).  For this case, the succinct description of the FEP reasoning used in the summary tables is ""Excluded based on low consequence (conservative bound).""  For example, a few radioisotopes, such as Np, may be incorporated into the structure of phases of other minerals (primarily uranium minerals) that form during degradation of the waste.  For chemically similar elements such as Np and U, the effective solubility of Np as a minor constituent of a uranium mineral is less than the solubility of the analogues pure Np mineral.  However, this FEP, ""secondary phase effects on dissolved radionuclide concentrations at the waste form"" in  Table 2.3-7 , was conservatively excluded in TSPA-SR.  The degree of conservatism is not quantified since the collection of data to justify the model would require either too much time or too many resources for the surmised potential benefit.  The exclusion of FEPs that have a potential beneficial consequence is a conservatism of the FEPs screening process.  This conservatism is in addition to the many conservative approaches used to include FEPs as more fully discussed in Chapter 3.    2.3.2.1 FEPs Related to the Radioisotope Inventory Component   Five FEPs relate to the Radioisotope Inventory Component ( Table 2.3-1 ).  The waste inventory was reconsidered and 27 important radionuclides identified.  The radioisotopic gas inventory was omitted because the screening analysis showed that gases were not significant contributors to dose.  However, one radioisotopic gas,  14 C, is included as a dissolved species.  Not all isotopes of uranium and plutonium are included in the 27 important radionuclides, and so the proper proportion (""dilution"") of the included uranium and plutonium isotopes is evaluated for the Waste Form Degradation Model when evaluating solubility.  For the TSPA-SR analysis, radioactive decay (and ingrowth 6 ) is modeled, and the heterogeneity of the inventory in the waste form is included using three waste forms (CSNF, DSNF, and HLW).     2.3.2.2 FEPs Related to the In-Package Chemistry Component   Twenty-five FEPs relate to the In-Package Chemistry Component ( Table 2.3-2 ).  Prior to TSPA-SR analysis, uncertainty in the in-package chemistry was evaluated through scientific judgment; but objectively demonstrating that the uncertainty from these 25 FEPs was included was difficult; an in-package chemistry component was developed for TSPA-SR analysis to explicitly include many of these FEPs.  Furthermore, a few FEPs dealt with the coupling of the in-package chemistry with other model components; these FEPs can now be included in the current TSPA-SR analysis.    2.3.2.3 FEPs Related to the CSNF Matrix Degradation Component   Seven FEPs relate to the CSNF Matrix Degradation Component ( Table 2.3-3 ).  The process of CSNF dissolution and radioisotope release has been included in TSPA analysis for a number of years through an regression equation of experimental results on both irradiated and unirradiated fuel.  The use of samples of irradiated fuel implies that the potential enhanced dissolution from radiolysis, radiation damage, and alpha recoil has indirectly been included in the dissolution rates.  The small differences in results and theoretical arguments, however, show that these latter effects are actually insignificant and can be excluded from consideration.  While an unimportant distinction for the CSNF since experimental results are available that include these effects, enhanced dissolution from radiolysis, radiation damage, and alpha recoil are excluded from DSNF and HLW degradation as discussed below.  The process of magma interacting with the waste has formally been included this year in the analysis for the TSPA-SR and is described in the Disruptive Events PMR.    2.3.2.4 FEPs Related to the CSNF Cladding Degradation Component   Twenty FEPs relate to the CSNF Cladding Degradation Component ( Table 2.3-4 ).  These 20 FEPs were developed based on comments received on early TSPAs (e.g., DSNF-TSPA-93-SNL  [ Rechard 1993 ] and DSNF-TSPA-94-SNL [ Rechard 1995 ] and the TSPA-VA [ DOE 1998b ]).   Several perforation mechanisms have been included in the CSNF Cladding Degradation Component: initial perforation in reactor before receipt of the waste, creep perforation, stress corrosion cracking, mechanical failure due to severe earthquakes, and localized corrosion.  The influence of temperature on creep and stress corrosion cracking are also included.  Localized crevice corrosion,  and diffusion-controlled cavity growth, have been excluded based on FEP arguments.  Based on arguments in an AMR dealing solely with this topic, hydride perforation mechanisms such as hydride embrittlement and DHC have also been excluded.    Complete failure of the cladding after perforation is modeled through unzipping of the cladding in an aqueous environment 7 .  Unzipping in a very hot, dry environment where the UO 2  is rapidly oxidized to U 3 O 8  is excluded based on low consequence since the required high temperature conditions do not exist when WP failure typically occurs.    2.3.2.5 FEPs Related to the DSNF Degradation Component   Three of the FEPs related to CSNF Degradation Component ( Section 2.3.2.3 ) also apply here (radiolysis, alpha recoil, and radiation damage).  These three radiation effects are included by conservatively bounding the degradation of rate of experiments on irradiated N-Reactor fuel.  Six additional FEPs specifically related to the DSNF Degradation Component are listed here ( Table 2.3-5 ). Four of these FEPs relate to the potentially increased reactivity of some types of the DSNF.  However, the additional reactivity is of low consequence and so these four FEPs are screened out.  One FEP relates to the degradation of cladding for DSNF, but is conservatively excluded by not including cladding performance for DSNF except for the naval SNF, whose analysis will account for the performance of the cladding.    2.3.2.6 FEPs Related to the HLW Degradation Component   Four FEPs specifically relate to the HLW Degradation Component ( Table 2.3-6 ).  One primary FEP and its underlying secondary FEPs deal with the enhanced degradation that may occur if extensive phase separation or glass recrystallization occur in the encapsulating glass; however, production controls will prevent significant initial phase separation.  Furthermore, temperatures in the repository are low relative to the melting point of the glass such that extensive recrystallization will not occur in the glass.  The HLW Degradation Component explicitly includes the effect of temperature on HLW glass degradation.  Another FEP deals with the proper reactive surface area to use when evaluating the degradation rate of the glass.  The HLW Degradation Component bound the reactive surface area by multiplying the geometric surface area by a very conservative, but constant cracking factor of 20.    2.3.2.7 FEPs Related to the Dissolved Radioisotope Concentration Component   Many processes influence the dissolved concentration of radionuclides in the Dissolved Radioisotope Concentration Component.  However, most of those processes have been discussed separately in the In-Package Chemistry Component since these processes also affect other model components.  Here four FEPs are listed that have a more direct connection with the dissolved radionuclide concentration ( Table 2.3-7 ).  First, solubility control based on pure phases has been and continues to be included in the TSPA-SR analysis.  Although a few radionuclides such as Np may be incorporated into the structure of phases of other minerals (primarily uranium) that form during degradation of the waste such that the solubility of these other minerals control the concentration of the radioisotope, these effects have been conservatively excluded. Complexation of radionuclides by organic ligands has been excluded because organic material is generally prohibited from the repository and the incidental amounts of organic material that may inadvertently occur cannot alter the solubility of significant amounts of radionuclides.     2.3.2.8 FEPs Related to the Colloidal Radioisotope Concentration Component   Sixteen FEPs relate to the Colloidal Radioisotope Concentration Component ( Table 2.3-8 ).  Three types of colloids were included: those already present in the groundwater, those formed during corrosion of the WP, and those formed during degradation of the waste.  Condensed Pu polymer colloids were excluded since they have not been observed in fuel or glass dissolution tests.  Biological activity was screened out, and so microbial colloids were also excluded.  Transport and filtration of colloids inside the WP were conservatively excluded.     2.3.3 Relationship of Model Components, FEPs, and Factors   The model components listed in  Section 2.2  are closely aligned with the principal and other factors that affect repository performance.  Table 2.3-9  shows the correspondence. Note that FEPs 2.1.02.09.00 and 2.1.09.02.00 are related to two different factors.    2.4 Influence of design changes on Waste form degradation model   The design of the repository continues to evolve in preparation for the future license application.  In general, these design changes can directly influence the screening arguments for FEPs and their inclusion in or exclusion from the waste form degradation model.  The elimination of backfill is an important design change that has been made after the development of the current Waste Form Degradation Model.  The primary effect of the elimination of backfill is the decrease of peak temperatures inside the WP, which is beneficial.  For example, the temperature decrease (1) reduces the chance for creep rupture and stress corrosion cracking of CSNF cladding; (2) reduces the degradation rates of the CSNF and HLW matrices; (3) improves the applicability of the current data for in-package chemistry; and (4) decreases the solubility of uranium.  However, design change to eliminate backfill does not affect the Waste Form Degradation Model because temperature is explicitly included as a model variable.  That is, the model is an explicit function of the surface temperature of the waste package ( Figure 1.5-1 ), so any changes in the surface temperature of the waste package because of the design change are automatically included.    3. MODELS AND ABSTRACTIONS    3.1 RADIONUCLIDE INVENTORY COMPONENT  The function of the radioisotope inventory abstraction component is to estimate the inventory of those radionuclides most important to human dose.  The inventory abstraction component is input for the waste form degradation models and is developed from a series of steps that starts with radioisotope inventories of various spent nuclear fuel assemblies and HLW then estimates the radioisotope inventory when packaged in disposal containers.  Three important aspects of the radionuclide inventory are (1) selecting the most important radionuclides for human dose out of the few hundred found within the waste, (2) obtaining the radioisotope inventories of various wastes, and (3) grouping the fuels into the waste packages selected for modeling in the TSPA-SR analysis.    Using radionuclide activities for CSNF assemblies, DSNF canisters, and HLW canisters, the radionuclide inventory component provides an estimate for activities in containers destined for disposal in the potential Yucca Mountain repository as shown in  Figure 3.1-1 .    The inventory abstraction is described in the  Inventory Abstraction  AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000f ) and the eleven supporting calculations ( Figure 3.1-2 ).  Three sources were used for inventory data:  the commercial utilities for CSNF ( CRWMS M&O 1999d ), the DOE NSNFP for DSNF ( DOE 1999b ), and the Yucca Mountain EIS program for the HLW, mixed oxide fuel (MOX), and plutonium ceramic ( DOE 1999a ). From this radioisotope inventory, the most important radionuclides for human dose were evaluated.  Arrival scenarios were developed for CSNF, and the inventory was assigned to WP configurations. Average and bounding inventories were developed for each package configuration recommended for the repository.  Then, the package-specific radionuclide activities were combined using the number of WPs in each group as a weighting factor to get the radionuclide activities in each allocation category.    3.1.1 Description    3.1.1.1 Radionuclides Important for Total System Performance Assessment   The relative importance of individual radionuclides for human inhalation and ingestion doses was evaluated for several waste types, time frames, and release scenarios.  In this evaluation, the effects of inventory abundance, radionuclide longevity, element solubility, and element transport affinity were considered. To address inventory abundance, eight waste types were examined 9 .  To address radionuclide longevity, the fuels were evaluated between 100 and 1 million years after repository closure.  The elements were evaluated in two solubility groups, the relatively soluble and the relatively insoluble (Am, Cm, Zr, Th, Nb, Pa, and Sn) and three transport affinity groups:  (1) highly sorbing, (2) moderately sorbing, and (3) slightly to non-sorbing.  The isotopes within each group were compared to one another for relative importance.  Three release scenarios were considered:  nominal case, human intrusion, and direct volcanic release.  Two time frames were considered: 100 to 10,000 years and 100 to 1 million years.    The set of important isotopes was different for each scenario and time frame.  For the first 10,000 years,  99 Tc and  129 I are normally the primary contributors to dose ( DOE 1998c , Figure 4-29).  For a direct release from a disruptive event scenario out to 10,000 years,  90 Sr,  137 Cs,  227 Ac,  229 Th,  231 Pa,  232 U,  233 U,  234 U,  238 Pu,  239 Pu,  240 Pu,  241 Am,  243 Am were screened in.  These are the isotopes that contribute most to the dose when release is not mitigated by either solubility or transport.  For a nominal release and human intrusion scenario out to 10,000 years  14 C,  99 Tc,  129 I,  227 Ac,  229 Th,  232 U,  233 U,  234 U,  236 U,  238 U,  237 Np,  238 Pu,  239 Pu,  240 Pu,  241 Am,  243 Am were screened in.  By modeling the plutonium isotopes ( 238 Pu,  239 Pu,  240 Pu), the americium isotopes ( 241 Am,  243 Am),  229 Th, and  227 Ac, doses that could result from colloidal transport of radioactive material to the biosphere will be adequately represented.  By modeling  14 C,  99 Tc,  129 I, the uranium isotopes ( 232 U,  233 U,  234 U,  236 U,  238 U), and  237 Np, doses that could result from transport of solutes, either by fracture flow or matrix diffusion, will be adequately represented.  In addition,  63 Ni,  90 Sr and  137 Cs are screened in for a human intrusion scenario because the event could occur as early as 100 years after repository closure.  For the time period from 10,000 to 1 million years,  210 Pb,  226 Ra,  230 Th, and  242 Pu are screened in for all of the scenarios, and  231 Pa is screened in for the human intrusion and nominal release scenarios.  The result is 24 isotopes recommended for modeling in the TSPA-SR analysis and TSPA-FEIS.  The 24 isotopes are shown in  Table 3.1-1 , along with the isotope selection from previous performance assessments.   For TSPA 1993 ( Wilson et al. 1994 ) and 1995 ( CRWMS M&O 1995 ), all radionuclides contributing to 99.99 percent of the potential dose at any time from 1,000 to 1 million years were retained for the inventories.  For TSPA-SR analysis, all radionuclides contributing to 95 percent of the potential dose at any time from 100 to 1 million years were retained for the inventories.  Thus, radionuclides that contribute to the last five percent of the dose estimate were eliminated from consideration in the TSPA-SR analysis.   For the TSPA-VA ( CRWMS M&O 1998b ), a smaller number of representative radionuclides were chosen. A radionuclide was included in the TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) if it had:  (1) a high solubility, (2) a low sorption affinity, (3) a significant inventory 10 , (4) a high dose conversion factor, and (5) a long half-life.  In addition, some radionuclides were included based on previous experience (1993 TSPA calculations [ Wilson et al. 1994 ], 1995 TSPA calculations [ CRWMS M&O 1995 ], and scoping calculations) and the experience of other organizations (NRC performance assessments [ Wescott et al. 1995 ]).   For the Iterative Performance Assessment (IPA) ( Wescott et al. 1995 ), the NRC screened radionuclides to include only the major contributors to cumulative release and dose.  A radionuclide was retained in the inventory if, in preliminary calculations, it contributed more than one percent of the EPA cumulative release limit for that radionuclide 11 .  The screening analysis also checked the maximum dose to a farm family to see if any of the radionuclides that might have been screened out on the basis of cumulative release should have been kept on the basis of dose.   The differences between the isotope selection in these PAs are primarily due to: (1) the changing regulations (dose - cumulative release - groundwater protection; 10,000 years - 1 million years, groundwater - human intrusion - volcanic releases), (2) inventory data relied upon, and (3) the screening techniques.     3.1.1.2 Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Inventory   Commercial nuclear power plants use a variety of fuels and fuel configurations in their reactor cores to generate power.  The predominant fuel is enriched uranium dioxide, but a plutonium/uranium mix is also planned for use in commercial reactors to dispose of excess plutonium from the government inventory.  Fuel pellets are packed into fuel rods (which vary in size depending on the application), and fuel rods (clad in Zircaloy or stainless steel) are bundled into assemblies.  The number of fuel rods per assembly and the number of assemblies in a reactor core vary depending on the reactor design.   Once a reactor fuel has been irradiated to the extent that it can no longer effectively sustain a chain reaction, it is removed from the reactor and becomes spent nuclear fuel.  Its isotopic composition at that point depends on the initial enrichment of the fuel, the reactor configuration (pellet size, fuel rod size, assembly layout, and other parameters), and the extent of irradiation (called burnup).  Once removed from the core, the fuel is placed in storage and it ages.   Almost 230,000 CSNF assemblies will need to be disposed, and each assembly, depending on the reactor configuration, initial fuel enrichment, burnup, and the age of the waste (time in storage), will have a unique isotopic composition.  The radionuclide inventory abstraction collects this information and synthesizes it into a form that can be modeled in TSPA-SR analysis.   A 1995 data submittal from the commercial utilities provided the basic information from which the TSPA-SR analysis inventory for CSNF was developed.  In 1995, the utilities supplied historical information about reactor assembly discharges up through December 1995, and they provided five-cycle forecasts for assembly discharges from their reactors.  With this information, a design basis waste stream was developed ( CRWMS M&O 1999d ), and forecasts for assembly discharges over the lifetime of each commercial power reactor were developed.   For the base case repository design of 70,000 MTHM, three alternative schedules were developed for moving the CSNF assemblies out of storage and shipping the assemblies to Yucca Mountain.  The schedules, called arrival scenarios, include the year of receipt for each shipment, the number of assemblies in each shipment, the type of fuel in each shipment (pressurized water reactor (PWR) versus boiling water reactor (BWR), and the enrichment/burnup characteristics of the fuel.    Radionuclide activities for each assembly in the waste stream were estimated, and the WP configuration that could accommodate the assembly based on its potential criticality level was determined.  The result was a grouping of the 230,000 CSNF assemblies into five proposed WP configurations. For each group, average and bounding assembly radionuclide activities were calculated.    3.1.1.3 U.S. Department of Energy Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste   For the most part, DSNF (with the exception of the naval SNF) and HLW are planned to be disposed together in codisposal waste packages.  Therefore, they are discussed together here.   The DSNF consists of more than 250 distinct types of spent fuel, and much like CSNF, radionuclide inventories for defense fuels will vary widely depending on the history of the fuel. The NSNFP grouped the fuels into 11 groups ( DOE 1999b ). DOE fuels will be packaged in three types of canisters before they are shipped to Yucca Mountain; short, long, and multi-container overpack (MCO).  Similarly, the naval fuels will be packaged in two types of canisters:  naval long and naval short ( Dirkmaat 1997 , Appendix F, Attachment, p. 1).  For analysis, the fuels are grouped by canister type and average and bounding per canister radionuclide inventories were calculated.    The HLW in storage at DOE sites is the result of reprocessing SNFs (some CSNF and some DSNF).  The proposed technology for immobilization of HLW is vitrification in a borosilicate glass.  The vitrified waste will be placed in one of two canister types (long and short).  A small amount of HLW glass has been produced at the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP) in New York.  Production of HLW has started at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and HLW will eventually be produced and stored at two other sitesthe Hanford Reservation (HR) and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Because the fuels reprocessed at each of these sites differ, the radionuclide inventory of the HLW and resultant glass product will vary slightly among the sites.   The data source for the HLW source terms, which include radionuclide inventory, decay heat, and radiation sources due to gamma rays and neutrons, is the response to the EIS data call as described in  DOE (1999a) . The sites included in the data call are the HR, SRS, INEEL, and WVDP. HLW fuels will be packaged in three types of canisters before they are shipped to Yucca Mountain:  short, long, and Pu disposition.  The information from the data call was used to calculate average and bounding per canister inventories.   The average radionuclide activity from DSNF for one of these WPs is the number of canisters times the average per canister radionuclide activity calculated.  The average radionuclide activity from HLW for one of these WPs is the number of canisters times the average per canister radionuclide activity calculated.  The radionuclide activity for the DSNF allocation group is an average, weighted by the number of packages in each group, over the six WP configurations.  Similarly, the radionuclide activity for the HLW allocation category is an average, weighted by the number of packages in each group.    The naval SNF, by agreement, is conservatively treated separately using average CSNF inventory and degradation characteristics.    3.1.1.4 Radionuclide Masses in Allocation Categories for Total System Performance Assessment for Site Recommendation   The waste types, allocations, and waste packages for commercial spent nuclear fuel, DOE spent nuclear fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and plutonium disposition waste are shown in  Figure 3.1-1 .  In the TSPA model, over 250 types of DOE spent nuclear fuels and HLWs are represented as being packaged in the ten types of canisters listed in  Table 3.1-2 . These canisters and the CSNF assemblies are, in turn, represented as being emplaced in ten types of waste packages, which are also listed in  Table 3.1-3 .  The waste packages and canisters combine to give a total of thirteen waste package configurations.  The waste package configurations and the number of packages with each configuration for TSPA modeling purposes are listed in  Table 3.1-3 .   These waste package numbers were specified by management edict ( Stroupe 2000 ), and are somewhat different from the ""Proposed Action"" numbers used in the DEIS ( DOE 1999a ) or the ""truncated case"" in recent input transmittals ( CRWMS M&O 2000aj  and  2000ae ).  The management specified numbers are ""not to exceed"" numbers and are rounded up from the truncated case, in order to convey flexibility in the design.  The truncated case has more HLW canisters than the DEIS, in order to use the ""ideal waste emplacement scenario"" for codisposal.  Neither the management case nor the truncated case may be emplaced without a redefinition of ""HLW MTHM equivalency"" or the elimination of the 70,000 MTHM limit specified in the  Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 .  Using the historical definition of 0.5 MTHM per HLW canister, these cases contain more than 4,667 MTHM HLW equivalent.   Table 3.1-3b  compares some of the canister and assembly numbers for the various scenarios.   There will be 7860 CSNF packages and 3590 codisposal packages in the TSPA-SR analysis model.  The 300 naval packages were grouped with the codisposal packages in the first version of  CRWMS M&O 2000f , but were regrouped with CSNF packages in the subsequent input transmittal ( CRWMS M&O 2000ak ).  Naval spent fuel is expected to perform very well within the repository, and it is better represented by commercial packages than by codisposal packages in the TSPA.  Accordingly, the naval fuel inventory was removed from the high level waste and DOE spent nuclear fuel averages, and the averages were recalculated for the input transmittal ( CRWMS M&O 2000ak ). The impact analysis of this change is expected to show that the old values were conservative, and the total TSPA values are not significantly affected.  The radionuclide inventories in grams for the selected isotopes are shown in  Table 3.1-4 .     Three radionuclides appear in  Table 3.1-4  that were not listed in  Table 3.1-1 .   228 Ra,  232 Th, and  235 U were not identified as important contributors to dose for the direct release scenario, the human intrusion scenario, or the nominal release scenario.  However,  228 Ra and  232 Th will be modeled in TSPA for the groundwater protection scenario and therefore were included in the inventory abstraction.  235 U will be modeled in the TSPA because it is a parent to  231 Pa.  To get accurate estimates of the dose from  231 Pa, TSPA must track the transport of  235 U.    3.1.2 Uncertainties, Limitations, and Conservatisms   The screening analysis is conservative because all fuel types, bounding and average, all time periods, and all transport groups were examined.  Any changes that might be expected in the wastes that may be disposed at Yucca Mountain will not change the radionuclides that were screened in for modeling in TSPA.   The representative inventories were derived from unqualified projections of future waste streams.  The actual waste streams will be known only at the time of actual repository loading. The projected waste streams could differ from the actual waste streams in their fuel burnups, fuel ages, fuel enrichments, and utility efficiencies.  However, changes that might be expected in the waste stream will produce only minimal (less than 20 percent) changes in the radionuclide activities in the fuels.  Given this understanding, the values chosen for initial inventories in CSNF and codisposal waste packages are reasonable representations of the inventory that may be disposed at Yucca Mountain ( CRWMS M&O 2000f ).    3.1.3 Other Views   Alternative approaches for developing the radionuclide inventory have been explored in previous TSPAs ( Wilson et al. 1994 ;  CRWMS M&O 1995 ;  CRWMS M&O 1998b ) and in the DEIS ( DOE 1999a ).  In previous TSPAs, ( Wilson et al. 1994 ;  CRWMS M&O 1995 ;  CRWMS M&O 1998b ), radionuclide activities for CSNF were developed by assuming an average set of fuel characteristics (enrichment, burnup, and age of the waste) and using the DOEs Characteristics Database to determine radionuclide activities for a fuel having the specified characteristics.  Radionuclide activities for DSNF were developed by assuming that the defense fuels can be grouped into a few representative groups (based on their chemical characteristics) and calculating inventories for a representative fuel from each group.  Radionuclide inventories for HLW were developed by assuming that an average of glass waste from the Savannah River Vitrification Plant and processed waste from Hanford, INEEL, and the West Valley Facility can represent HLW.   The TSPA-SR analysis screening method used a qualified process to ensure traceability.  It looked at both bounding and average fuels, DSNF and HLW as well as CSNF, time periods from 100 to 1  million years, and both inhalation and ingestion doses.  By using two solubility groups and three different transport groups and comparing the radionuclides within the groups, better discrimination was achieved.  For example, if all isotopes were lumped together, plutonium would dominate the dose.  But this is true only if Pu is readily transported to the accessible environment.  The full TSPA-SR analysis and its colloid models will predict the likelihood of significant Pu transport.  The screening could not rely on TSPA output and, thus, did not rely on any assumptions about solubility or transport affinity.   The TSPA-SR inventory analysis is more detailed and flexible than previous analyses and is tied to the waste stream.  Changes in WP configuration or waste stream are more easily reflected in the per package inventory of representative WPs.  An example of such a change is seen in the recent regrouping of naval spent nuclear fuel.    3.2 In-package Chemistry Component   The function of the in-package chemistry model component is to estimate the fluid chemistry inside the WP over time after the initial breach of the disposal container.  This chemistry is then used by the several other model components (see  Figure 1.5-3 ) since the rate of degradation of the matrix of waste, the resulting dissolved concentration of radionuclides, the stability of any colloids, and degradation of cladding are all dependent on the chemistry of fluids within the WP.  The rate of degradation of the waste matrix and inner stainless steel container, in turn, influences the fluid chemistry and so there is a coupling between all the chemically interacting components of the system.   The  In-Package Chemistry Abstraction  AMR   ( CRWMS M&O 2000g ) is the primary document describing the regression equations used for evaluating the in-package chemistry.  This document, in effect, abstracts the process models that are developed in  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms  ( CRWMS M&O 2000o ).  The  In-Package Chemistry Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000g ) also relies on a few of the FEP screening arguments in  Miscellaneous Waste-Form FEPs  ( CRWMS M&O 2000n ).  While abstraction of process models is numerically convenient, it is technically defensible only if the abstracted model conservatively bounds the predictions of process-level models. In this case, dissolved radionuclide levels predicted with the abstracted model must be equal to, or greater than, those predicted by the underlying process-level models.  The most reliable way to assure technical reliability of the abstraction is to force it to be mechanistically identical to the process-level model.  This was done for the solubilities of the majority of the primary radionuclides by building abstractions of in-package chemistry and solubility expressions on equilibrium speciation output of EQ3NR.    3.2.1 Description   The fluid chemistry inside the package (in-package chemistry) is dependent upon the initial chemistry of the water entering the breached package, the volume of water flowing through the package, the amount of water remaining within the package, and the amount of time that inflows into the waste package occur.  The inflows were assumed to have the composition of J-13 groundwater.  Early breach of a WP would almost certainly entail chemical interaction under substantially higher temperatures.  Under such a scenario, evaporative concentration of reacting fluids would be expected to result in in-package fluids that diverge substantially from the compositions calculated under the 25°C, zero-evaporation limiting case considered here (see below).  Various breach scenarios can be envisioned for the container, but as explained later, the current model assumes a fully flooded container (bathtub scenario) for the volume of water present in the container at all times.  In addition, the in-package chemistry is dependent upon the degradation rates of the contents of the package.  Two representative WPs were modeled, a CSNF package and a DSNF/HLW codisposal package ( Figure 3.2-1 ).  In both cases, there is an inner stainless steel disposal container, but the basket materials and waste forms are different and influence the fluid chemistry at least for short time periods.   Direct use of a complex equilibrium code within the TSPA-SR analysis calculation was not practical; rather, a limited number of simulations were run with the complex equilibrium code, for a variety of input conditions and degradation rates of the contents.  Regression equations were then developed for use directly in the TSPA-SR analysis calculations as explained below ( Figure 3.2-2 ).   3.2.1.1 In-Drift Fluids   The calculations for revision 00 of the  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms AMR  ( CRWMS M&O 2000o ) were performed in parallel with the testing and analysis of the effects of the near-field environment (NFE) on the water that may contact and enter the waste package.  This parallel work is summarized in the NFE ( CRWMS M&O 2000z ), EBS ( CRWMS M&O 2000y ), and waste package degradation ( CRWMS M&O 2000d ) process model reports.  However, for these first calculations, the J-13 well water composition was used for water entering the waste package ( Harrar et al. 1990 , Section 11).  J-13 well water is quite dilute and its composition is not expected to significantly affect the in-package chemistry.  On-going work will verify this assumption, or provide better information.    J-13 well water is used as a surrogate for the groundwaters passing through the repository and possibly into breached WPs several thousand years after the repository has closed.  The most abundant dissolved constituents in J-13 well water include Na and C, along with Si, Ca, K, F, Cl, N, and Mg.  Dissolved Na, K, and Ca came from dissolution of feldspars into down-flowing meteoric water.  Si was contributed by dissolution of feldspars and Si polymorphs.  C and N came from equilibrium with soil and atmospheric gases encountered in transit.  J-13 well water has undergone cation exchange with zeolitic rocks (causing increased Na/Ca) compared to UZ pore waters at the repository horizon.  This is important for understanding the overall chemical budget of repository waters.  Because Na and Ca play non-specific roles in the overall degradation process, ion exchange is less important to predicting what occurs once J-13 comes into contact with WPs.  J-13 well water has a pH of ~8 and is thought to be close to equilibrium with carbon dioxide at levels slightly higher than that present in the atmosphere.  The slightly higher than neutral pH of the solution is a direct result of alkalinity production that occurs when primary phase silicates are weathered.  Waste package alteration scenarios are less sensitive to the exact composition of the water entering the package than they are to dissolution rates of a number of waste package components because:  (1) The rates of WP component dissolution are not overly sensitive to minor variations in these parameters and (2) WP components rapidly come to dominate the dissolved phase after onset of reaction.  Calculations have been started for a new version of the  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms  analyses and models report to test the sensitivity of the in-package chemistry to incoming water composition.  It is expected that the incoming water will consist of the water found in the unsaturated zone subsequently modified by evaporation and/or condensation and fluid-rock interaction. Accordingly, sensitivity calculations are being done using a range of waters including the compositions in  Table 3.2-1  as well as 100-fold evaporated J-13 water.    Table 3.2-1  provides the major element composition of J-13 well water, Drift-Scale Test (DST) water, and the output of THC modeling.  DST compositions represent an average of waters collected from Alcove 5 near the DST and were used as input compositions for modeling of thermal-hydrologic-chemical coupling in the NFE.  DST water is thought to have moved appreciably through fractures and interacted with the rock matrix.  The modeling output for waters expected to seep into the drifts is shown for two time periods,  the transitional cool-down period (1,000-2,000 years) and the extended cool-down period of 2,000-100,000 years. By using these water compositions as well as 100-fold evaporated J-13 well water, the sensitivity calculations are covering a broad range of chemistries and should give a good indication of the sensitivity of the resulting in-package chemistry on the input water composition.    The in-package chemical reaction calculations used input fluid flows of 1.5 to 150 L/yr. The temperature of the simulations was set at 25°C to represent the conditions that will occur several thousand years after WP emplacement, when the original thermal pulse has passed and temperatures have returned to near ambient levels.  Waste form degradation may occur at temperatures up to 100°C.  It is assumed that the process can be modeled adequately with the 25°C thermodynamic database.  The calculations represent what occurs at times > 10,000 years, after the thermal pulse has passed and package temperatures are at, or below, 100°C.  The justification for using 25°C thermodynamic data to model processes that might occur at somewhat higher temperatures is that many of the input thermodynamic parameters are not strongly sensitive to temperature over the range of 25 to 100°C, hence the broad scale features of the output fluid compositions are deemed independent of temperature.  Dissolution rates of WP internal components would be greater at temperatures greater than 25°C.  Typically, dissolution rates of minerals roughly double with every 10°C increase in temperature.  In the absence of high temperature dissolution rates, this is probably a reasonable approximation for the behavior of metallic and oxide WP internal components as well.   The net effect of temperatures greater than 25°C would therefore be a more rapid release of WP components into solution than what is reported here.  Note that the existing calculations tend to err in this direction already because they use very high rates as input.   Higher temperatures would also affect the boundary conditions of the calculation by decreasing the solubilities of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the fluids reacting with the WP.  A more important impact of temperature on in-package chemistry would almost certainly be the evaporative concentration of inflowing and reacting solutions, which could conceivably change the concentrations of a number of important chemical species by orders of magnitude.  Evaporation of J-13 water before interaction with WP components would result in a high ionic strength, alkaline solution.  For example, 200-fold open-system concentration of J-13 water produces a pH 10, 1 mol/L ionic strength solution, which has 200 times as much chloride and total carbonate as J-13.  Evaporation of J-13 type water is expected to lead to the formation of calcite, chalcedony, fluorite, and possibly sepiolite and other less abundant minerals.  The important consequences of evaporation for fluid influx chemistry are increases in chloride, pH, and bicarbonate. Increased chloride impacts WP internal component corrosion.  Glass and mineral dissolution rates tend to double for every unit increase in pH above 8.  Many radionuclides are more soluble in the presence of bicarbonate.  The sensitivity calculations will provide an indication of how important evaporation may be on in-package chemistry.     The partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen were set to, respectively, 10  -3.0  and 10 -0.7  bar ( DOE 1998c , Figure 3-36). The latter represents equilibrium with oxygen at atmospheric levels.  Reaction with rock bolts (and steel supports) was neglected because the interaction of the fluid with waste package components would greatly outweigh any transient contact of the fluid with the rock bolts and the steel ground support.  The total surface area of rock bolts likely to be encountered by seepage before contact with waste package components is small.  It is likewise difficult to envision substantial interaction with the support material before seepage into the waste package.    3.2.1.2 Water Contact Scenarios   As described in the  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms  Process Model  CRWMS M&O (2000o) , a simple degradation scenario for the WP entails breaching the WP (presumably through stress corrosion cracking and/or mechanical failure); filling of the WP void volume with seepage fluids from the drift; reaction within the WP; and releasing contaminated fluids at the same rate at which fresh fluids entered.  This simple breach scenario was adopted and each breached WP was modeled as a continually stirred, fixed volume vessel. Specifically, the calculations used the solid-centered, flow-through mode of EQ3/6; in this mode, an increment of fresh fluid solution is added to the WP system and a like amount of solution is removed at each time step. The void volumes considered were a constant 4,507 L for the CSNF WP and a constant 5,811 L for the DSNF WP.   The assumption of a continually stirred vessel is a simple and common approach to estimating the nature and extent of chemical reaction.   The basis of the assumption is that either the fluid is continually stirred, or equivalently, the residence time of the fluids in the vessel is sufficient for diffusion to eliminate chemical gradients.  In general, the latter basis is valid because of the geologic time scale of seepage and chemical reaction involved.     Further justification is reasoned as follows. If wetting of WP components were complete, but void filling was not, the reduced fluid/solid ratio would tend to maximize the amount of dissolved solids in the effluent.  On the other hand, the overall chemical reaction would be less for fluids that found themselves in ""dead-end"" channels, or if portions of the WP were physically inaccessible to fresh fluids.  Furthermore, fluids that found ""fast paths"" that short-circuited interaction with WP solids would bear a much fainter signature of chemical reaction.   Evaporation of fluids by residual heat could increase the salt content (i.e., ionic strength), and, thereby, increase some radioisotope solubilities, and possibly increase the rate of WF or WP degradation. The increased salt content, however, is not expected to significantly alter the overall reaction path ( CRWMS M&O 2000o , Section 7) and was examined in a FEP on the use of J-13 well water ( Section 2.3.2.2 ).     This breach scenario provides an upper bound for in-package radionuclide transport and release.  It does not include any time delay for water that enters the package; it does not include any retardation of radionuclides into immobile secondary phases by coprecipitation or sorption; it does not allow for radionuclides to be held-up in stagnant areas of the WP, and it maximizes contact between oxidizing fluids and WF and WP materials.   The analyses using the in-package chemistry results also used bounding assumptions or large uncertainty (see  Section 3.3 , CSNF Matrix Degradation;  Section 3.4 , CSNF Cladding Degradation,  Section 3.6 , HLW Degradation, and  Section 3.7 , Dissolved Radioisotope Concentration).  In particular, the possible effects of localized chemistry are included in the CSNF cladding degradation model.    3.2.1.3 Waste Package Contents   In-drift solutions seeping into a breached WP would encounter a number of kinetically reactive solids whose reaction rates are only known within orders of magnitude ( Table 3.2-2 ).  Fluids intruding into WPs containing CSNF would encounter UO 2  fuel wrapped in Zircaloy cladding, Al alloy, 316 stainless steel (with and without neutron absorbers, such as boron or GdPO 4 ), and A516 low carbon steel.  A range of degradation rates was used for each.  Dissolution of the fuel, and release of radionuclides, occurs only after degradation of some of the cladding.  General corrosion of cladding is likely to be insignificant under the geochemical conditions expected inside reacting WPs.  Uncertainty in the initial failures, localized corrosion, mechanical damage, and other degradation mechanisms are addressed in the cladding degradation AMRs and were not available when the in-package calculations were started, so a range of clad damage and CSNF fuel exposure was investigated (100 percent, 20 percent, and 1 percent). The WP configuration used for the codisposal package calculations was that of the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) DSNF with five HLW glass logs.    3.2.1.4 EQ3/6 Reaction Path Modeling   As described in the  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms  AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000o ) simulations of WP alteration by ambient groundwater were done using the qualified reaction path code EQ3/6 ( CRWMS M&O 1998a ;  CRWMS M&O 1999c ), which titrates masses of WP components at a rate determined by input reaction rates and fluid influxes into the breached WP.  The software package, EQ3/6, Version 7.2b, was approved for QA work by LLNL and is identified as Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI): UCRL-MA-110662 V 7.2b.  EQ3/6 periodically assesses the chemical equilibrium state of the solution and removes newly saturated, secondary mineral or gas phases from the fluid. In addition to kinetic inputs (e.g., rates, compositions, and masses of reactants) EQ3/6 relies on a thermodynamic database describing the chemical stability of minerals, aqueous species, and gases.  When the reacting solution becomes saturated with respect to solids or gasses, EQ3/6 converts dissolved components into the respective phase and then allows the latter to act as a reservoir of the respective components for use at subsequent times.  In this way, EQ3/6 tracks the elemental composition of the reacting fluid for the duration of the reaction path calculation while at the same time providing estimates of the nature and masses of secondary phases that are predicted to form. The code, however, does not provide for the kinetic inhibition for phase formation, which is, therefore, the responsibility of the analyst.  Generally, the assessment of kinetic inhibition must be made on the basis of there being an absence of the particular phase in low-temperature (~25°C) environments.  For example, dolomite (CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 ) is predicted to form in a number of runs due to the accumulation of Ca, Mg, and alkalinity upon reaction with WP components.  Dolomite, though thermodynamically favored to grow in a number of low temperature natural solutions such as seawater, apparently must overcome severe kinetic obstacles to actually form and is actually observed growing only in highly evaporated brines.  These kinetic considerations are then the basis for suppressing formation of dolomite in the reaction path calculations.  Similar arguments are used to suppress the formation of a number of oxide and silicate minerals that are typically observed to form only under high temperature conditions.      3.2.1.5 Results of Waste Package and Waste Form Alteration Modeling     Table 3.2-3  summarizes the range of in-package fluid compositions predicted to occur for both the CSNF and codisposal packages (see  Section 3.2.1.6  for further discussion of this chemistry and  Section 3.2.2  for limitations).    CSNF WPs– The majority of WPs in the repository will contain spent fuel rods from commercial reactors.  The primary reactions that occur upon breach of CSNF WPs and subsequent alteration by intruding fluids are:  (1) a rapid decrease in pH caused by dissolution of low-carbon steel and (2) a subsequent rise in pH caused by CSNF dissolution and oxidation of Al alloy ( Figure 3.2-3 ).  The latter rise is more pronounced under conditions of high clad failure.  By the same token, the lowest predicted pHs are those calculated for the least amount of clad failure.  Feedback between the pH and clad corrosion rate was not included within the calculations, as the pH is not expected to go low enough to cause significant increases in clad failure rates (see  Section 3.4.2.4 ).  Under the assumed fixed CO 2  conditions of the simulations, carbonate levels are relatively high at high pH and low at low pH.  Because both U and Pu form soluble complexes with carbonate, the dissolved levels of each tend to increase at high pH and decrease at low pH.  However, the lowest pHs occur in the early stages of the reaction paths before appreciable U or Pu has been dissolved from the CSNF matrix.   Minerals predicted to form during alteration of CSNF WPs include:  copper minerals, silicates (clays, uranium silicates), oxides (metal oxides, actinide oxides), carbonates, phosphates, sulfates, and fluorides.  Although the inputs to the calculation are normalized to a liter of fluid, and a liter volume is assumed to persist, the large volumes of lower density corrosion products (mainly hematite and UO 3· 2H 2 O) suggest that alteration products might actually fill the void space and seal off portions of the WPs to further fluid influx.  This is further discussed in  Section 3.4 .    Codisposal WPs– In all codisposal runs ( Figure 3.2-4 ), the input pH of ~8.1 prevails initially.  Then the system pH progresses towards a minimum, primarily due to the oxidation of the A516 carbon steel.  The high specific rate and relatively high surface area of the latter mean that its dissolution tends to dominate the whole reaction path, at least as long as it remains.  Oxidation of sulfur in the steel to sulfate is the primary proton-producing reaction.  After the steel is exhausted, dissolution of base cation-containing HLW glass leads to increased pHs. pHs as high as 10 and ionic strengths as high as ~5.8 mol/L were predicted for codisposal  WPs under conditions of high glass dissolution and low flow rates.   Minerals predicted to form during alteration of codisposal  WPs typically include the same minerals formed during CSNF alteration, though borates are also predicted to form, and the uranium silicates are more important.     3.2.1.6 Abstraction of In-Package Chemistry   The predicted compositions of in-package fluids are of particular importance for estimating releases of radionuclides to the biosphere.  The  Summary of In-Package Chemistry for Waste Forms  ( CRWMS M&O 2000o , Section 6) provides reaction-path modeling assuming steady-state CO 2  and O 2  concentrations in the drift and breached WPs.  The analysis indicates the broad range of effluent compositions that might be expected from a breached WP and provides a basis from which to establish abstractions describing radioisotope solubilities.   The analysis of calculated in-package fluid compositions possesses four broad features.  Carbonate alkalinity increases with pH due to the assumed fixed partial pressure of CO 2 .  System Eh decreases with pH due to the assumed constant partial pressure of O 2 .  Low early pHs are only seen with low cladding failures, and alkalinities typically correlate with high ionic strengths associated with high glass dissolution and low flow rates.   The EQ3/6 simulations calculate the fluid chemistries that are operative over long periods of time (> 1,000 years).  The simulations over this time period are typically different than those that prevail over shorter periods of time.  Recognition of this change in process is important for estimating long-term behavior.  Typically reaction times of less than 1,000 years result in relatively minor degradation of WP components; hence, the concentrations of many radionuclides are often well below their respective solubility limits.  In effect their concentrations depend directly on the dissolution rates of WP components.  At much greater time spans, many, but not all, radionuclides have reached saturation with at least one mineral phase.  Once this has occurred, dissolved levels of the particular radionuclides will depend on the thermodynamics of secondary phase stability and much less directly upon the dissolution rates of the WP components.    The abstraction of in-package processes is based upon a series of multiple linear regression analyses of the output from the EQ3/6 simulations as presented in the  In-Package Chemistry Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000g , Attachment I).  The multiple linear regression analyses take explicit account of the change in process control with time and treats results for times less than 1,000 years after waste package breach separately from those for later times.  The specific relationships between pH, Eh, clad failure, and component degradation are illustrated in  Figure 3.2-2 .  The predictions from the multiple regression analyses, and the output from the EQ3/6 simulations are presented in the abstraction AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000g ) and summarized here.   Because it is difficult to track the failures of individual packages in TSPA, the in-package chemistry abstraction was implemented in an approximate way for a group of packages. Let t be the current time and let t fail  be the average time of failure for all the breached waste packages. The short-time abstraction would apply for t – t fail  < 1000 years, and the long-time abstraction would apply for t – t fail  > 1000 years.   The pH abstraction follows two lines of reasoning based on the WP type (CSNF or codisposal ), and the difference in kinetic rate laws between the two.  The rate law for CSNF is proportional to the hydrogen ion activity, i.e., proportional to pH, such that at low pH the dissolution rate increases ( CRWMS M&O 2000o , Section 6.1.1).  For HLW the rate law is ""U"" shaped with the minimum at pH 7 and the rate increasing above and below pH 7 ( CRWMS M&O 2000o , Section 6.1.1).  Therefore, conservative assumptions for one waste form may not be conservative for the other.  In the case of the CSNF (and naval SNF), for example, assuming the lowest observed pH for the first 1000 years after breach, and the averaged pH thereafter would be the most conservative, while still honoring the pHtime history.  However, for the codisposal  package using the lowest observed pH would be conservative for the first 1000 years after breach but not for later times, when use of the maximum pH is conservative. The difference in the rate laws between HLW and CSNF and the difference in their pHtime profiles for the two waste forms predicates the use of different assumptions in the abstractions.   For the CSNF, at times less than 1,000 years after waste package breach, minimum pH values for each flow/cladding/corrosion scenario were regressed to produce two abstractions of pH; one for low WP corrosion rates and the other for high WP corrosion rates, where the axes were x = cladding coverage, y = water flow (Q), and z = pH.  This process was repeated for times greater than 1,000 years after breach, where the average pH for the entire modeled duration (0 to 10,000 years after breach) was used to calculate the average pH.  The average pH for the entire duration is conservative because it includes the low pH values at early times, which tends to lower the average value compared to averaging over the late time information (1,000 to 10,000 years after breach).    The resulting four data matrices were used to generate four response surfaces describing pH at less than and greater than 1,000 years after breach.  These response surfaces were provided for TSPA to use in pH calculations.   Table 3.2-4  provides the equations of the planes that bound the pH parameter space for CSNF, and  Figures 3.2-5  and  3.2-6  show these planes.  Each plane represents either the low or high corrosion rate data for the WP materials, 316 stainless steel, aluminum alloy, A516 carbon steel, and borated stainless steel.  An uncertainty range of ±1 pH unit was recommended for TSPA.    Table 3.2-5  and  Figures 3.2-7  and  3.2-8  show the equations describing minimum and maximum pH parameter space for codisposal WPs.  The balance of the acid production from the Alloy 516 carbon steel and base production from the glass determine the pH.  At early times (< 1,000 years after breach), acid production dominates, but as the steel is consumed, base production overcomes the acid production. In most cases, this is not calculated to occur until considerably after 10,000 years after breach.  To obtain conservative glass degradation rates, the maximum pH in the 100,000 year simulations was used.   Due to the simplicity of the mathematical expressions used to calculate pH, it is possible, by increasing the water flow Q, to calculate unrealistic pH values.  Therefore, it was necessary to set limits for the maximum allowable Q.  Since the calculated pH from all of the expressions in  Tables 3.2-4  and  3.2-5  are directly proportional to water flow through the WP and as the water flow increases the potential for reaction of the through-flowing water with the WP/waste form materials decreases, the pH of the water exiting the WP should approach that of J-13 well water.  Therefore, above some maximum Q-value, the water exiting the WP should have the same pH as the water entering the WP.  This critical value of Q was calculated by solving the expressions in Tables   Tables 3.2-4  and  3.2-5  for Q and using the input, J-13 well water value for pH and assuming linear behavior.    For CSNF at time less than 1,000 years after breach, the pH expressions ( Table 3.2-4 ) are valid within the range of 0 < Q < 5.3 (m 3 /yr).  Likewise, when Q   5.3 m 3 /yr, then the pH is constant at 8.1 (±1).  For time greater than 1,000 years after breach, the pH expression ( Table 3.2-4 ) is valid for 0 < Q < 0.24 (m 3 /yr), and when Q   0.24 m 3 /yr the pH is constant at 8.1 (±1).  Similarly for codisposal waste packages, the pH expressions ( Table 3.2-5 ) are valid within the range of 0 < Q < 1.1 (m 3 /yr) at time less than 1,000 years after breach and 0 < Q < 0.36 (m 3 /yr) for time greater than 1,000 years after breach. Above these values, the pH is constant at 8.1 (±1).   Total dissolved carbonate affects the solubilities of a number of actinide phases as well as the degradation rate of CSNF.  The total dissolved carbonate is abstracted as a function of pH by assuming a partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2  = 10 -3  atm and equilibrium between the carbonate, bicarbonate, and carbonic acid in solution:      Total C (mol/L) = 10 -4.47  + (10 -10.82 )/10 -pH  + (10 -21.15 )/10 -2pH  (Eq. 3.2-1)     The system Eh is important in particular for determining the solubilities of many of the actinides.  In aqueous systems in equilibrium with the atmosphere, the Eh may be abstracted directly from the pH and the assumed partial pressure of oxygen (0.20 atm):      Eh = 1.217  0.059 · pH  (Eq. 3.2-2)   where Eh is in volts.  The ionic strength was used in determining the colloid content of the water exiting the NFE.  For the period before 1,000 years after breach, the minimum ionic strength was calculated for each flow/cladding scenario (beta distribution from 2.757   10 -3  to 2.922   10 -3  mol/L) and glass rate/corrosion rate scenario (beta distribution from 2.537   10 -3  to 3.479   10 -3  mol/L). At times greater than 1,000 years after breach, the average value of ionic strength was used from each scenario to get the ionic strength range used in the abstraction (beta distributions from 2.827   10 -3  to 3.943   10 -1  mol/L for CSNF and from 7.86   10 -3  to 1.353 mol/L for codisposal).  This is a conservative approach compared to using the maximum value because low ionic strength is conducive to colloid formation, and using the minimum value would also create the worst case, which is not reflective of the actual in-package conditions.   Fluoride was considered in the cladding degradation model. Fluoride was only pertinent for the CSNF and naval SNF because there was no cladding protection included in the codisposal package modeling.  The CSNF calculations indicate that the fluoride concentration is controlled by fluorapatite.  The abstracted distribution was normal between 1.148   10 -4  and 9.114   10 -4  mol/kg with a standard deviation of 2.2   10 -4  mol/ kg.  Chloride levels remain constant at 2.0    10 -4  mol/kg and therefore are too low to influence the models that rely on bulk chemistry.    3.2.2 Confidence/Limitations/Validation   This work represents the first attempt by the DOE to model the chemical interactions that occur within the WP for use within the TSPA calculations.  Only limited sensitivity runs have been completed to study the importance of issues such as:      Codisposal fuel configurations  (type and amount of DSNF, type and amount of basket materials) (Sections 6 of  CRWMS M&O 2000aa ,  CRWMS M&O 2000ab ,  CRWMS M&O 2000ac ).       Feedback between chemistry and corrosion rates (built-in or iterations) The substantial accumulation of alteration products might ""choke off"" subsequent corrosion.  At the same time, sharp shifts in fluid chemistry associated with WP alteration might also accelerate corrosion.  At present, there is little feedback, either negative or positive, within the modeling.  Iterations or more involved rate laws describing chemical corrosion would allow the more important feedbacks to be assessed.  For example, for a flooded WP, the development of an alteration rind, even 1 cm thick, could prevent widespread oxidizing conditions at the sites of waste form degradation, which could substantially lower actinide solubilities (Section 6.3 of  CRWMS M&O 2000ad ).  The uncertainties associated with predictions of fluid flow and solid exposure in the WP are formidable.  By assuming full exposure of WP components, the calculation is conservative since it maximizes the potential for chemical degradation of the WP and for release of radionuclides.       Water contact scenario Predictions of specific degradation geometries and reduction in the uncertainty due to water contact scenario are difficult.  The water contact scenario in the TSPA-SR analysis used to calculate in-package chemistries is merely the simplest of approaches.  Only scoping calculations to determine the sensitivity of the system are justified at this time.      Assumptions of fixed O 2 , CO 2 Assuming oxidized, carbonated conditions in the WP tends to maximize the solubilities of many of the most important radionuclides.  Reaction paths calculated under less oxidized, and/or less carbonated conditions would tend to predict lower dissolved levels of Pu and U (Section 6.3 of  CRWMS M&O 2000ad ).      Hydrogen evolution The assumption was made that H 2  gas was not evolved in modeling carbon steel corrosion.  This is conservative in allowing for the maximum pH reduction.      Radiolysis–   Radiolysis was neglected in the present analysis.  The probability of WP breach is quite low before about 1,000 years, and the likelihood of significant radiolysis is much lower at later times.  In theory the formation of NO 2  by radiolysis might conceivably cause in-package pHs to decrease by forming nitric acid.  Two features that would tend to work against such a scenario are the inherent buffer capacity of the assemblage and outgassing of NO 2  from the breached WP and into the drift.  Radiolysis of water and off-gassing of H 2  may also increase the local effective Eh; however, at late times this is also not expected to be significant ( CRWMS M&O 2000s , Section 6.2; 2000h, Section 6.1; 2000n, Section 6.2.52).  Highly localized energy deposition from alpha-decay might have some effect on dissolution rates, but these effects are also not expected to be significant ( CRWMS M&O 2000h ).      Database            Temperature Although the thermodynamic database used in the EQ3/6 calculations extends to 300°C, for many species, the data are most accurate at 25°C, the temperature where the data were originally measured.   Ionic strength Note that calculations for solutions with ionic strengths exceeding ~0.7  mol/L are less accurate than dilute systems, but the uncertainties are small relative to the other uncertainties within the system.         The above limitations and uncertainties were considered as the modeling was performed (see  CRWMS M&O 2000ad , Section 5.1 for discussion of ionic strength effects on actinide carbonate complexes and some uncertainties in the databases [Pu stability constants, U-silicate stability constants]).  The range of predicted chemistry is quite large and conservative, and further work is expected to only fine-tune the scenario and time dependent in-package chemistry.  The calculated range of in-package chemistries is believed to represent the widest possible range of conditions that can confidently be expected.  Indeed, a number of natural processes would tend to prevent more extreme chemistries than predicted here.  Substantial reservoirs of freely exchangeable carbon dioxide would tend to prevent excursions to hyperalkaline conditions.  Dissolution of solid components in the WP can buffer pH as well.  The fact that free oxygen is likely to prevail in the drifts sets limits on how reduced WP fluids can become.  Moreover, the accumulation of reactive corrosion products formed during WP degradation will also tend to buffer in-package solution chemistries.   Based on the considerations discussed above, this model is appropriate for its intended use.   In summary, the in-package geochemistry model was based on a large number of reaction path calculations covering a range of fluid fluxes, WP component degradation rates, and clad exposure scenarios.  The calculated range of solution compositions is believed to encompass the most reasonable range of compositions of fluids that ultimately exit the WP.  Nevertheless, the model outputs are valid only under the conditions stated above, and by necessity require a number of assumptions about the amount of WP components contacted by fluids, feedback between chemical compositions and corrosion, radiolysis, in-package evaporation, and the validity of the thermodynamic database.  Wherever possible, these inputs have been used in a conservative fashion.   Nevertheless, because there exist no complete long-term measurements of WP degradation, and because natural analogs for such a process are not known to exist, it is not possible to fully validate the model at this time, or to assign absolute confidence limits to in-package chemistry outputs.  Model outputs would be expected to be less valid if temperatures greatly exceed 25°C, if in-package evaporation causes ionic strengths to exceed 1 mol/L, or if input solutions contact only certain parts of the WP rather than the entire WP.    3.2.3 Other Views  Chemistry inside of the WP affects the degradation of the waste form and the ability to support cladding credit.  The TSPA Peer Review report ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.E) cited the TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b , p. 3-102) in noting that ""the chemistry within the WP, hence the long term performance of Zircaloy cladding, is not well understood and has considerable uncertainty.""  It also noted ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.G) that hydrogen production internal to the WP was not addressed adequately in the TSPA-VA ( DOE  1998b ).  The peer review report ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section IV.E) also cites an Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB) report to Congress ( NWTRB 1998 , p. 34) calling for theoretical and experimental work to predict the ranges of local environmental conditions that could exist inside a WP and identifies the need for more explicit definition of the geochemical environment during potential corrosion events, particularly within the WP ( Budnitz et  al. 1999 , Section II.E).    For the TSPA-SR analysis, the Waste Form Degradation Model now explicitly contains an In-Package Chemistry Component (a regression model based on process modeling) to predict ranges of chemical conditions inside the WP to better characterize the uncertainty in the degradation of the cladding and waste form.  Ongoing sensitivity studies will provide more information.  For the TSPA-SR analysis, the production of hydrogen was examined; however, the process was screened out in a FEP argument.    3.3 CSNF DEGRADATION COMPONENT   Under oxidizing conditions in the presence of liquid or vapor water, the UO 2  in CSNF is not stable and alters.  Alteration of the UO 2  matrix can liberate radionuclides important to human dose.    The main function of the CSNF degradation model component is to determine the rate of degradation of the CSNF fuel as a function of temperature and water chemistry (specifically, pH, and partial pressures of O 2  and CO 2 ) as shown in  Figure 3.3-1 .  This degradation rate function is combined with the in-package chemistry to determine a rate, which is then directly used by the Cladding Degradation Model Component ( Section 3.4 ) to determine the rate that the CSNF cladding splits open and exposes more of the fuel matrix.  In addition, the CSNF degradation model examined the distribution of radionuclides within the fuel and established a gap fraction for the more volatile radionuclides.   One AMR is the primary document supporting the CSNF Matrix Degradation Model Component,  CSNF Waste Form Degradation: Summary Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000h ) (see  Figure 3.3-2 ).  This, in turn, depends on the data reports of the major sets of experiments conducted on CSNF.  A minor document supporting this AMR is  Miscellaneous Waste-Form FEPs  ( CRWMS M&O 2000n ).      3.3.1 Model Description   To determine the rate and consequences of CSNF degradation, dissolution of a number of fresh and spent fuels was examined under both saturated and unsaturated conditions using flow-through reactors as well as static, batch reactors and drip tests.  Flow-through experiments involve passing fluids past a chamber containing CSNF fragments and allow rapid measurement of the dependency of CSNF forward dissolution rates on variables such as solution pH and pCO 3 .  Batch tests involve placing a few grams of spent fuel in various configurations in less than a liter of synthetic J-13 groundwater, periodically sampling the solution, and analyzing for the appropriate radionuclides.  These data provide information on the spent fuel dissolution rates for saturated conditions such as may occur if water pools within the WP.  Unsaturated drip tests, in which the fuel is exposed to 100 percent relative humidity and various amounts of injected simulated groundwater, provide information on the degradation of the fuel in WPs that do not have pooling of water.  The batch and unsaturated tests also give empirical information on secondary phase production, colloids, and effective solubility limits for the more insoluble radionuclides.   From the many experiments performed, an understanding of the mechanisms of spent fuel dissolution has emerged.  Commercial nuclear fuel is composed primarily of uranium dioxide which, when exposed to mildly oxidizing solutions, is oxidatively dissolved to uranyl ion, UO 2 +2 .  The rate of UO 2  oxidation depends on the interaction of specific surface species that control the rate-determining dissolution step.  The increase in CSNF degradation rates with decreasing pH (at low pH), and with increasing carbonate levels (at high pH), suggests that adsorbed protons and/or carbonate ions control the dissolution reaction under flow-through conditions.  Indeed,  Grandstaff (1976)  showed that the uraninite dissolution rate dependence on aqueous carbonate concentrations could be explained by using a Langmuir adsorption isotherm relating coverage of the surface by carbonate ions to carbonate solution concentrations.     Important aqueous species that might also affect dissolution rates are calcium and silicon ions, which can form stable corrosion products possessing low solubilities.  Electrochemical studies have shown fast reduction in dissolution currents when thin layers of corrosion products form, but an increase of UO 2  reactivity as the applied potential is increased ( Shoesmith 1999 , Section 3.1.1).  At very low applied potentials (< – 400 mV vs. saturated calomel) very slow oxidation begins (possibly concentrating at grain boundaries); up to – 100 mV, dissolution becomes discernible.  As the applied potential increases to +300 mV oxidation, dissolution and corrosion product formation are significant; above +300 mV dissolution is rapid because corrosion products are not formed on the solid surface.  The likely electrochemical reaction sequence is:              surface oxidation    bulk oxidation    dissolution             UO 2    UO 2+x      UO 2.33   {UO 2 2+ } surface          [UO 2 2+ ] bulk    [UO 2 2+ ] soln      Secondary Phases       The intrinsic dissolution rates of UO 2+ x  and a number of spent fuels were determined by using a single-pass flow-through reactor that allows UO 2  dissolution to be measured far from solution saturation (no precipitation of dissolved products).  Note that the forward dissolution rate bounds the release rate, the latter being the material loss rate from the fuel + alteration products.   Tables  3.3-1  and  3.3-2  show the tests and results from which the dissolution model for alkaline conditions (pH > 7) were regressed ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , Equation 16):     Log Rate = 4.69 + [–1085/T] – 0.12 · p[CO 3 ] T   –  0.32 · pO 2  (Eq. 3.3-1)  Rate has units of mg/m 2·  day. T is temperature (kelvin); p denotes the negative logarithm of either the carbonate concentration (mol/L) or the oxygen partial pressure (atm).   To construct the abstracted acid dissolution model, the temperature and oxygen rate dependencies derived under alkaline conditions were assumed to hold for acid conditions.  The pH 7 alkaline rate was then assumed to be common to the alkaline and acid pH rate laws (within the uncertainty of both rate laws).  A qualified data point (pH = 3) was used to define the low pH end of the acid pH rate law.  The latter, which describes rates at pH   7, is given below ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , Equation 18):    Log Rate = 7.13 + [–1085/T] – 0.32 · pO 2  – 0.41 · pH   (Eq. 3.3-2)   The combined abstracted model is shown in Figure 3.3-3.   As discussed in the AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , Section 6.2.2.2), pH dependence is weak under alkaline conditions and rate and pH are controlled by carbonate and oxygen.  Under acidic conditions pH is a more significant factor, while p[CO 3 ] T  is less significant as (H + ) protons dominate the surface reaction sites.      3.3.1.1 Gap and Grain Boundary Inventory   As summarized in  CRWMS M&O (2000h , Section 6.5) some fission-produced radionuclides,  14 C,  135 Cs,  137 Cs,  129 I,  99 Tc, and  79 Se, migrate from the UO 2  matrix of light water reactor (LWR) spent fuels at the high fuel temperatures of reactor operation and deposit onto the cooler grain boundaries and fuel/cladding gap surfaces. At waste package and cladding breach, these radionuclides may be released faster than those within the fuel matrix.  Volatile cesium and iodine, in addition to the fission gases, are the most conspicuous elements in this category.  Recent performance assessments ( CRWMS M&O 1998b , Section 6.3.1.3.1) of the potential repository at Yucca Mountain used gap and grain-boundary fractions of 2 percent of the total inventories of  135 Cs,  137 Cs,  129 I, and  99 Tc.  The gap fraction was modeled to dissolve rapidly if the spent fuel were to be contacted by groundwater ( CRWMS M&O 1998b , Section 6.3.1.3.2).  Laboratory measurements of a few LWR spent fuels show that both the gap and grain boundary inventories of  99 Tc and  90 Sr were near the detection limits of the methods used, less than 0.2 percent of the total inventories of these elements.  However, some of the  99 Tc may reside at the grain boundaries in the form of relatively insoluble metallic particles and not be detected by these tests.  Measured combined gap and grain-boundary inventories of  129 I approximately equal the fission gas release fractions.  For  137 Cs, the combined gap and grain-boundary inventories were approximately one third of the fission gas release fractions.  For the TSPA-SR analysis, the fast release fraction consists of an immediate release of 4.2 percent of the total iodine inventory, and 1.4 percent of the cesium inventory.  In addition, 0.2 percent (range 0 to 0.4 percent, uniformly distributed) of all the radionuclides including additional cesium and iodine is immediately released from the grain boundaries and fuel and gap surfaces.    3.3.2 Confidence/Limitations/Validation   The abstracted CSNF dissolution model was based on a large set of qualified flow-through experiments.  It is valid from pH 3 to 10, oxygen pressure from 0.002 to 0.2 atmospheres, and total carbon concentrations from 2   10  -4  to 2   10 -2   molar.  At pHs less than or equal to  7, this model is valid at CO 2  pressures of 10– 3  atmospheres. From an analysis of the fit of the model to the data, and from further consideration of the uncertainty of application of data from young spent fuel (< 30 years out of reactor) and unburned UO 2  toward the prediction of long term (> 1,000 year) performance of spent fuel, the model was estimated to be valid to within 1.5 orders of magnitude.  This model was compared to unsaturated drip tests, batch tests, and a range of literature results.  The model and uncertainty range adequately accounted for, or overestimated, all dissolution rate data.  In addition, a comparison of the phases produced in the unsaturated drip tests compare well with that of natural analogs.   Based on the considerations discussed below, this model is appropriate for its intended use.    3.3.2.1 Comparison to Unsaturated Drip Tests   Long-term drip testing of CSNF under hydrologically unsaturated conditions, i.e., limited water and an oxidizing atmosphere, has been done over the past six years to determine the relationship between the rate of CSNF alteration, i.e., dissolution and secondary phase formation, and the release rate of radionuclides.  Small samples of two commercial PWR spent nuclear fuels, Approved Testing Material-103 and Approved Testing Material-106, are subjected to three experimental conditions: vapor injection, low-drip-rate injection, and high-drip-rate injection, all at 90°C ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , Section 6.3).  All drip samples were completely wetted.  The nominal drip rate is 0.75 mL every 3.5 days in the high-drip-rate tests and 0.075 mL every 3.5 days in the low-drip-rate-tests.  In the vapor tests, minimum water is available for transport, and the absence of added cations and anions limits the type of alteration products (secondary phases) that may form.  A CSNF intrinsic dissolution/corrosion rate is estimated from the release of highly soluble  99 Tc and  90 Sr which are assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the spent fuel matrix ( 129 I and  137 Cs are concentrated at the fuel grain boundaries and fuel-clad gap).   In the high-drip-rate tests iodine release rates decreased about an order of magnitude after 1.3 years of reaction.  Tc release remained relatively constant over time and appears to depend on the initial burnup of the fuel.  Less than 1 percent of the reacted uranium was released into solution after 1.6 years.  Most of the neptunium and plutonium release occurred in the first year.  Thereafter, nearly all of the  237 Np (96.5 - 99 percent) and  239 Pu (99.5 - 99.6 percent) was retained.  Transmission-electron microscope examination ( Finn et. al. 1998 ) indicates that the Pu is retained as a residue at the fuel surface.  Of the 0.01 percent of the Pu that is released into the leachate, greater than 50 percent is sorbed on the walls of the stainless steel vessel (the remainder is colloidal).  After 4.8 years of reaction,  129 I and  99 Tc release rates are similar.   In the low-drip-rate tests,  99 Tc release rates increased by 2.5 orders of magnitude when the fuel was immersed in leachate at 3.1 years, suggesting that the  99 Tc that was originally dissolved had become loosely bound to the corrosion products before immersion.  Apparently pertechnetate, TcO 4  , precipitates as a soluble salt as the liquid in the low-drip-rate test becomes concentrated.  When excess water is introduced as in an immersion test, the salts dissolve and Tc, Cs, and Sr are released.    In the vapor hydration tests, material transport may occur by one of two pathways: thin-film flow or spallation of unwashed fuel fines.  Radioisotope release rates were observed to vary substantially between the different fuel types that were considered.  The cause of this remains unclear.    If a roughness factor (the ratio of the measured surface area to the geometrically estimated surface area) of three is assumed, the high-drip-rate dissolution rates are estimated to be 17 and 38  mg/(m 2· d), compared against a predicted value of 22  mg/(m 2· d) at pH 8, 0.001 mol/L carbonate, and 90°C for a fuel with a burnup of 30 MWd/kgU.  Therefore, the agreement between the rate model above and  99 Tc release rates is good. The calculations for the other isotopes show reduced release rates because the isotopes are retained in corrosion products.      3.3.2.2 Comparison to Batch Tests and Literature   The rate models can be compared against batch tests, published data cited in reviews by  Grambow (1989)  and  McKenzie (1992)  of pre-1992 literature, as well as more recent, flow-through measurements of  de Pablo et al. (1997) ,  Torrero et al. (1997) , and  Tait and Luht (1997) . Batch dissolution rates are lower than predicted rates but within a factor of 6.  The rate model above does not have as strong a carbonate dependency as that seen by  de Pablo et al.s (1997)  study.  The alkaline pH model predicts 0.0002 mol/L total carbonate rates that are consistently higher than  Torrero et al.s (1997)  carbonate-free rates.  The difference in carbonate levels though makes direct comparison impossible.  Torreros acidic data can be as low as 1/20th of the predicted value, yet Torreros acidic data overall seem low compared to other work (see  Grambow 1989 ).  In general, the present model predicts  Tait and Luhts (1997)  results well at the various sample, temperature, oxygen, and water-chemistry conditions.  Moreover, the trends in the model and data with temperature, carbonate, and oxygen are the same.  The models underpredict  Tait and Luhts (1997)  data at bounding conditions, such as 75C, and 0.1  mol/L bicarbonate by at most 0.88 orders of magnitude, which is within the uncertainty range of the model.    3.3.2.3 Natural Analogs   To establish confidence that experimental CSNF alteration pathways effectively represent likely natural processes, it is useful to compare the alteration mineralogy observed in experiments with natural occurrences of altered uranium oxides.  Uranium dioxide occurs in nature as the mineral uraninite which is structurally similar to CSNF.  Nopal I, a uranium mining site at Peña Blanca, Mexico, contains substantial quantities of uraninite and is arguably one of the best natural analogs for CSNF degradation in Yucca Mountain as it possesses geologic, geochemical, and hydrogeologic characteristics most similar to those at Yucca Mountain ( Murphy 1995 ).  The volcanic (tuffaceous) host rock at Nopal I, the youngest of the studied sites, has been relatively oxidizing for tens of thousands of year, though uraninite, containing U 4+ , was originally formed several million years ago.   In general, uraninite has been oxidized and hydrated at Nopal I.  In the presence of silicate and alkali ions, such as calcium and sodium, various alkaline uranyl silicate hydrates such as Na-boltwoodite and  -uranophane dominates alteration mineralogy at long times.   In the vapor tests a relatively simple combination of uranyl oxy-hydroxide alteration phases is observeddehydrated schoepite (UO 2 )O 0.25– x (OH) 1.5+2 x  (0    x    0.15) and metaschoepite ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , Section 6.6.2.  (A  minor phase is Cs-Ba-Mo-uranate, which incorporates two fission products, cesium and molybdenum.) Sodium and silicon are among the most abundant elements in J-13 well water, and, not surprisingly, the most abundant alteration product in the high-drip rate tests is the Na- and Si-bearing U 6+  compound Na-boltwoodite; the Ca- and Si-bearing U 6+  compound  -uranophane has also been identified in solid samples from these tests.  The higher-drip-rate tests exhibit two uranophane-group silicates,  -uranophane [Ca(UO 2 ) 2 (SiO 3 OH) 2 (H 2 O) 5 ] and Na-boltwoodite (Na,K)(UO 2 )(SiO 3 OH)(H 2 O).  Samples from low-drip-rate tests include metaschoepite, a Na-uranyl oxy-hydroxide tentatively identified as Na-compreignacite, and soddyite.  Again, Cs-Ba-Mo-uranate is a minor constituent.  In one sample, soddyite appears to replace Na-compreignacite.  Also, a few isolated crystals of Na-boltwoodite were first detected in one low-drip-rate test. The groundwater at Nopal I is richer in calcium than J-13 ( Pearcy et al. 1994 ) but poorer in sodium and potassium.  This could explain the dominance of  -uranophane at the natural site as well as the limited soddyite and weeksite occurrence.  There is substantial calcite at Yucca Mountain.  In time this may make repository alteration products conform more to the Nopal I sequence than that seen in the laboratory, which produces  -uranophane at long times.  Overall, the phase assemblage observed at Nopal I is similar to that derived experimentally in the CSNF alteration drip tests.    The general agreement between the observed alteration products in the various tests, the natural analogs, and the geochemical modeling provide confidence that the mechanisms of spent fuel corrosion are well understood, and that the forward dissolution model is bounding for long term prediction of CSNF degradation rates.    3.3.3 Other Views   The TSPA Peer Review Panel Report ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Executive Summary, Section E, Data and Research Needs) stressed the importance of advancing the spent fuel corrosion model beyond its VA representation, stating that a considerable knowledge of spent fuel corrosion is needed. It noted that the databases used in the VA for the corrosion of spent fuel were not adequate ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.A).  It also noted that the processes that ensue among the WP internals following penetration of the package were not addressed in any depth within the TSPA-VA ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.F).  The panel also questions the conservatism of the related base case conditions.  It suggested that steps be taken to develop better methods for analyzing the movement of radionuclides from the WPs.  Substantial discussion was dedicated to discussion of weaknesses in the VA spent fuel corrosion model ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section IV.F).    Weaknesses in the VA spent fuel corrosion model and documentation were identified by the peer review panel.  These were addressed in the development of the SR model and documentation as discussed in  Section 3.3  and  CRWMS M&O 2000h .  In particular, the mechanistic basis was discussed, a simplified model was developed, and model validation using an expanded database was performed.  Removing the conservatism of modeling of water-waste contact and radionuclide transport within the package was not given priority for SR, because in-package radionuclide transport was not determined to be a principal factor for the safety case.  However, the cladding degradation and the waste matrix degradation have been coupled as explained in  Section 3.4  and the degradation of the waste matrix was also coupled to the in-package chemistry to better characterize uncertainty as explained in  Sections 3.2  and  3.3 .    3.4 CSNF CLADDING DEGRADATION COMPONENT    3.4.1 Introduction   Since the 1950s, most CSNF has been clad with less than 1 mm (usually between 600 through 900  m) of Zircaloy, an alloy that is about 98 percent zirconium with small amounts of tin, iron, nickel, and chromium. The Zircaloy cladding is not a designed engineered barrier of the Yucca Mountain disposal system, but rather is an existing characteristic of the CSNF that is important to determining the rate of release of radionuclides once engineered barriers such as the waste packaged have breached. Zircaloy is very resistant to corrosion, and cladding failure is expected to be minimal in the first 10,000 years.  However, while Zircaloy provides excellent protective properties, characterization of the uncertainty in its performance is important.  This characterization is possible since data have been collected on its performance over the past 40 years by the nuclear industry and by others in several different harsh environments.    3.4.1.1 Function of Cladding Degradation Component   The cladding degradation component of the Waste Form Degradation Model predicts the rate that the CSNF matrix is exposed and altered based on the number of rods with perforated cladding at any one time.    3.4.1.2 Summary of Conceptual Model of CSNF Cladding Degradation   The degradation of CSNF cladding is assumed to proceed through two distinct steps:  (1) rod failure (perforation of the cladding) and (2) progressive exposure of UO 2  spent fuel matrix (see  Figure 3.4-1 ).  The number of failed rods is based on the observed rod failures while in the reactor and during storage, potential creep failures because of high disposal temperatures, stress corrosion cracking from high stresses and the presence of halide ions, hypothetical physical failures from seismic loads, and hypothetical localized corrosion inside the WP.  In all cases, the perforation is assumed to occur at the center of the rod because this ensures the fastest exposure of the waste matrix.  After the initial perforation, further cracking and splitting of the cladding is assumed to occur, which exposes the CSNF matrix as it progresses.  The splitting of the cladding (unzipping) is calculated as a function of the CSNF matrix alteration rate, which was described in the previous section,  Section 3.3 .     3.4.1.3 Modes for Initiating Cladding Perforations   Cladding perforation is the formation of small cracks or holes in the cladding.  Perforation of the cladding may occur because (1) the cladding initially fails within the reactor or during storage, (2) the cladding fails from creep or stress corrosion cracking, (3) an earthquake severely shakes and severs the rods, or (4) the cladding fails from localized corrosion  ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  While other mechanisms of initiating cladding perforations such as diffusion controlled cavity growth (DCCG) or DHC were explored, they were screened out based on low consequence as described later.    3.4.1.4 Cladding Failure after Perforation   After the cladding has been perforated, the fuel matrix can react with moisture or air.  The reaction is assumed to unzip the fuel rod because the fuel volume increases during oxidation of the UO 2 , (i.e., the oxidation of the UO 2  to secondary phases of uranium is assumed to cause enough pressure by volume expansion to burst the cladding from within) ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  This mechanism for increasing the exposed surface area of the matrix is sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature.  Based on observed behavior within storage pools at reactors, unzipping in a wet environment does not occur in observed time periods of 40 years, once the Zircaloy cladding has been perforated.  However, because unzipping in a wet environment could not be entirely ruled out and because complete exposure of the matrix bounds diffusive releases of radionuclides through the pinhole perforations, the project included the possibility of the clad unzipping in a wet environment ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  A small percentage of the inventory of iodine, cesium, and a few other radionuclides resides in the gap between the cladding and waste matrix. The release of the gap inventory is assumed to be instantaneous when the cladding is perforated and, thus, independent of the cladding unzipping. Cladding that was initially perforated is predicted to release its gap inventory when the WP is breached.    3.4.1.5 Documents Supporting Model Development   To carefully examine and describe the uncertainty about the expected protective capability of the cladding, eight AMRs and two calculations were prepared.  One AMR dealt strictly with FEPs related to cladding to more carefully focus attention on hypothetical failure modes.  Three AMRs dealt with specific modes of potentially perforating the cladding, an AMR and calculation dealt with evaluating temperatures of the cladding for creep calculations, and two AMRs dealt with further exposure of the cladding through unzipping ( Figure 3.4-3 ).    3.4.2 Description    3.4.2.1.1 Initial Cladding Condition    3.4.2.1.1 Initial Cladding Perforations   Two aspects of initial cladding condition are important ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  The first aspect is the number of rods of CSNF that arrive for disposal with cladding perforations and is discussed in this subsection.  The second aspect is the condition and characteristics of the unperforated cladding (e.g., the internal pressure and strain history of the cladding) and is discussed in the next subsection.  Because of the propensity of stainless steel to stress corrosion crack (SCC), all of the stainless steel cladding (~1.1 percent of the CSNF) is considered as a separate category of CSNF and is assumed to be initially perforated.  In the Zircaloy cladding category, the percent of rods arriving at the repository with perforations is dependent on the number of rods that perforate while (a) in the reactor (including fuel handling), (b) in pool storage or dry storage (including fuel handling), and (c) in transportation from storage.   Data exist for all three aspects.  Based on the data, the largest percentage of rods perforate when first placed in the harsh reactor environment ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Section 7, Table 13) ( Table 3.4-1 ).  Few perforations occur in the second and third cycles of the reactor operation or during storage and transportation.  Some data for reactor perforations extend over the operating history of the commercial nuclear industry.  The data for perforations used for TSPA-SR span the period 1969 through 1995.  As described in  CRWMS M&O 2000p , between 1969 and 1985, a contractor report for NRC is used; between 1985 and 1995 updates as reported in the literature are used.  The data on perforations are based on ~65,000 BWR assemblies with ~4 million rods and ~47,000 PWR assemblies with ~10 million rods ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Attachment I).   Currently most fuel is stored in pools at reactors but in the future much may be placed in dry storage.  Of these two methods of storage, dry storage has higher temperatures and thus greater propensity to cause perforations.  While not extensive, data have been collected and estimates made on future cladding perforations while in dry storage in studies done by the DOE at the INEEL and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  Cladding failures during transportation have also been estimated in order to license transportation casks for the NRC ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Section 6.11).   To include uncertainty in TSPA-SR, a distribution of initial rod perforations in a WP, expressed as a complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF), was developed from the available data on cladding perforations.  When developing the distribution of the perforations per WP, however, the type of blending assumed in the WP can be important since the performance of cladding has greatly improved over the years; in the mid-1970s, Zircaloy cladding perforations were much greater (still less than 5 percent) than observed today (less than 0.1 percent).  The SNF of the 1970s has lower initial burnup and has also cooled longer and so this CSNF fuel will likely be blended with newer, hotter CSNF of today to keep the waste packages at a more uniform temperature.    Conservatively assuming, however, that no blending occurs, a CCDF can be developed that is the sum of the CCDF of Zircaloy cladding perforations during reactor operations and the perforations during storage and transportation.  The small number of perforations that occur during storage and transportation ( Table 3.4-1 ) does not have the ability to significantly affect the shape of the distribution for initial perforations; consequently, no ranges or distributions were assigned to the data on storage and transportation.  A reasonable upper bound to this CCDF can be developed by assuming that whenever a rod was damaged (say from handling), all four rods in a square cluster were damaged.  The distribution was assumed to be symmetric and so the lower bound was developed by dividing by 4 ( Figure 3.4-4 ).   Potential perforation from creep rupture or stress corrosion cracking is not included as part of the initial perforation in  Table 3.4-1 .  Rather this was treated as incipient perforation information and became part of the initial condition of unperforated cladding discussed in the next subsection.  The creep rupture analysis was integrated because the rod damage from one period must be carried forward to the next temperature period to calculate the total strain and thus potential for creep rupture.  Stress corrosion cracking is also addressed in the same manner because the same highly stressed rods are susceptible to failure from either mechanism.    3.4.2.1.2 Initial Condition (""Pressure and Strain"") of Unperforated Cladding   The fact that few cladding perforations occur after the first cycle in a reactor suggests that there are few rods almost ready to perforate (i.e., ""incipient"" perforations).  Nonetheless, in order to analyze the potential perforation of the Zircaloy cladding from creep rupture or stress corrosion cracking after disposal, the initial condition of the cladding (e.g., internal pressure and strain history) was also estimated and uncertainty included ( Figure 3.4-2 ) ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Section 6.7).   Table 3.4-2  summarizes the distributions of the various properties developed for TSPA-SR.  The CCDFs for the various properties are not independent; consequently, they were generated using a single burnup distribution based on PWR cladding to maintain consistency. PWR cladding was modeled rather than BWR cladding because BWR cladding is thicker, BWR fuel is enclosed in flow channels which offer additional protection to the cladding, and BWR fuel is discharged with lower burnup and thus lower cladding stress.    3.4.2.2 Temperature History of Cladding and Fuel Matrix   In order to calculate the strain for creep rupture and hoop stress for stress corrosion cracking, the temperature history during storage and transportation is needed. The analysis assumed all Zircaloy cladding was placed in dry storage at the design temperature of the Castor Mark V WP.  Dry storage and the Castor Mark V package with 55 MWd/kgU burnup fuel was selected to be conservative.  For transportation, the cladding was conservatively assumed to be placed in a shipping cask for 3 weeks at a temperature of 350°C.  This is conservative since most rods will actually be exposed to lower temperatures for a shorter time frame.   In addition to the temperature history of the unperforated cladding prior to disposal, the temperature of the cladding during disposal is needed ( Figure 3.4-2 ). (Only hoop stress is considered since thermal stresses from differences in temperature are negligible because of the uniform temperatures in the WPs.) For TSPA-SR, a functional relationship between average surface temperature of the waste package and the temperature of the cladding was developed ( Figure 3.4-5 ); the functional relationship was based on a heat conduction model.  Because the temperature decreases from the center to the outside of the waste package, the waste package was discretized into six zones and a separate temperature profile is developed for each zone. Evaluation of cladding and matrix temperatures from the waste package surface temperature ( Figure 3.4-6 ) gives the cladding temperature for the average center rod in a WP.  In the repository, the average center rod cladding temperature peaks at 308°C; there is a ±13 percent uncertainty distribution included.  The uncertainty addresses both the uncertainty in WP internal temperature distribution and the uncertainty in predicting the WP surface temperature.  In the statistical analysis of 12,000 fuel rods, the full range of temperature uncertainties is sampled. After 1,000 years the WP surface temperature and internal temperatures are practically identical and so the WP surface temperature is used. The calculation of internal temperatures is fairly independent of the design of the engineered barrier since the WP surface temperature is treated as an independent variable in this approach.  Only the WP surface temperature is needed to correctly account for the engineered barrier design.    3.4.2.3 Creep Strain and Stress Corrosion Cracking Perforation   From the statistical expression of the initial internal pressures, temperature history during transportation and storage, and the temperatures during disposal, the perforations from creep and stress corrosion cracking are calculated in the CSNF Cladding Degradation Component ( Figure 3.4-2 ).    This approach is recommended in both the  Pescatore and Cowgill (1994 , p. 85) review of creep analysis and a recent NRC Interim Staff Guidance for analysis of creep damage during dry storage ( NRC 2000b , p. 85).  It is the methodology used in Germany ( Peehs 1998 , Figures 11 to 13) for licensing dry storage designs.  Uncertainties are established based on both experimental observations and analysis.  This analysis is appropriate for the TSPA since it uses both accepted methodology, and sufficient uncertainties.   Murtys creep strain correlation ( Henningson 1998 , p. 57), with appropriate uncertainties, was used for creep rupture for TSPA-SR.    Table 3.4-3  compares six different creep rupture correlations to 503 data points reported in five different sets of experiments. It should be noted that the stresses and temperatures are appropriate for higher stressed rods in a hot repository.  While the Matsuo correlation ( Matsuo 1987 , p. 23) has a slightly smaller relative error, Murtys correlation was selected because it explicitly models Coble creep, a type of creep that could be important at lower stresses and temperatures.  The uncertainty in the creep correlation was set at ±0.80, which was the maximum relative error range for Murtys correlation.  The uncertainty was assumed to be uniformly distributed. Both the data and correlations are for unirradiated cladding.  Irradiated cladding has a creep rate of about 1/3 that of unirradiated material ( Peehs 1998 , Figure 10). Most of the data, correlations, and earlier creep analyses were for unirradiated cladding.  The use of an unirradiated creep correlation introduces a conservatism that could be removed with additional creep modeling.   A CCDF of the strain required for creep failure was constructed from a series of tests by  Chung et al. (1987 , pp. 780, 781).  Chung et al. did a series of 20 slow burst and mandrel tests with irradiated BWR and PWR cladding.  Half the tests were for over 200 hours.  They measured an average strain at failure.  The average failure strain was 3.3 percent with a range of 0.4 percent to 11.7 percent (18 data points reported).  The lower values of this range are for BWR rods, which burst at lower strains.  The creep-failure analysis covers the full range of observed failures.   CRWMS M&O (2000p , Section 6.10.1), compares this failure criterion to four (4) different failure criteria developed by four different sources and shows that this criterion is conservative.     Figure 3.4-7  gives the CCDF for the hoop stress (at room temperature) in the rods expected to be received at YMP.  A sampling of 2,000 rods with stresses that define this distribution is used for the stress variation.  One rod (total of 12,000 rods analyzed, 2,000 rods located in each of 6 regions) with each of these stresses is assumed to be in each of the six regions across the WP.  This rod represents a specific fraction of the total WP inventory.  Each rod is exposed to a temperature profile represented by  Figure 3.4-6  (including dry storage and shipping) and a repository temperature history normalized by a WP radial-shaping factor.  A uniform temperature uncertainty of ±13.5 percent is included.  The creep strain is then calculated for the rod using the equations given in the AMR for  Clad Degradation-Summary and Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000i , Section 6.2.4) (including a uniform uncertainty of ±80 percent).  This strain is compared to a random sampling of the strain limit CCDF.  If the rod creep strain exceeds the strain limit, it is assumed that the fraction of rods represented by that radial zone in the WP has become perforated and is available for cladding unzipping.  This procedure is repeated for 12,000 rods in an Excel spreadsheet and the fraction of the WP inventory perforated is calculated.  In TSPA-SR, for a typical WP, the fraction of rods failed by creep ranges from 1.1  percent to 19 percent.  The best estimate is 2.4 percent.  A triangular distribution is sampled between these limits.  These failures are predicted for dry storage and transportation.   The above analysis has not been directly incorporated into the TSPA, but an abstraction has been included.  For this abstraction, the independent variable is the peak WP surface temperature.  The above analysis is performed for peak WP surface temperatures that vary from 177°C to 412°C.  The cladding temperature history while in the WP (right side of  Figure 3.4-6 ) is linearly shifted upward or downward by the difference between the base case and new peak WP surface temperature.  The change in temperature across the WP is then calculated.    Figure 3.4-8  is a graphical representation of the abstraction used in TSPA.  The plateau at the lower WP surface temperatures represents the rods that are failed in dry storage and shipping.  These rods can only fail once and, therefore, these rods cannot fail again in the repository.  Rods that have not failed have undergone some creep during dry storage and shipping and start the additional creeping from that point.   Figure 3.4-8  shows that at a peak WP surface temperature above about 300°C, the best estimate fraction of rods perforated from creep increases dramatically.  The upper limit represents the fraction of rods failed if the failure criterion is 0.4  percent creep, the minimum value in the failure criteria CCDF.  The minimum values represent the fraction of rods that would fail if the maximum failure criterion of 11.7 percent were applied.  The best estimate value represents a random sampling of the failure criteria CCDF.  In the TSPA, a triangular distribution is used between the upper limit, best estimate and lower limit in each realization to incorporate uncertainties in the WP peak surface temperature.    Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is considered along with creep rupture as a perforation mechanism since both require evaluating cladding stresses ( Figure 3.4-2 ) ( CRWMS M&O 2000i , Section 6.2.4).  SCC requires a susceptible material, an aggressive chemical environment, and a high stress level ( CRWMS M&O 2000ag , Section 6.1.11).  Zircaloy is not susceptible to SCC in NaCl, HCl, MgCl 2 , and H 2 S solutions ( Yau 1992 , p. 299-311).  The environments known to cause SCC in zirconium include FeCl 3 , CuCl 2 , halogen or halide-containing methanol, concentrated HNO 3 , liquid mercury or cesium ( Yau 1992 , p. 303), and 64 to 69% H 2 SO 4  ( Fitzgerald and Yau 1993 ).  The extremely oxidizing acidic conditions are not predicted for the bulk in-package chemistry but the possibility of such conditions occurring locally and transiently, are included in the local corrosion model.  However, iodine has been identified by several investigators as a cause of SCC in Zircaloy.  Iodine stress corrosion cracking (I-SCC) requires an iodine concentration in the fuel-cladding gap greater than 5   10 -6   g/cm 2 .  Below this threshold of free iodine concentration, Zircaloy cracking due to I-SCC has not been observed. Free iodine concentrations are expected to be negligible in SNF.  For the TSPA-SR it was conservatively assumed that a sufficient amount of iodine was present on the cladding, the stress was high, and that the duration of elevated temperatures was sufficiently long that once cracking started, there was sufficient time to propagate through the cladding.  The gas pressure inside the cladding and the resulting stress were evaluated ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Section 6.7).  It was assumed that any fuel rod with a stress above 180 MPa perforated by SCC.  This threshold was reported by  Tasooji et al. (1984 , Figure 3, p. 600).  Few rods have such high stresses and the same rods that fail from SCC are also prone to perforation from creep rupture. The calculations were combined, to avoid double counting perforated rods.  The inclusion of SCC increases the failure from creep alone from 0.49 percent to 1.1 percent for dry storage and transportation (left side of  Figure 3.4-6 ).  At higher repository temperatures, the difference disappears.    3.4.2.4 Localized Corrosion Perforation   Local corrosion is also considered as a perforation mechanism in the CSNF Cladding Degradation Component ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  Corrosion of zirconium has been observed in concentrated fluoride or chloride solutions at very low pHs or very high oxidation potential ( CRWMS M&O 2000ag , Section 4.1).  These conditions are not predicted to occur in the bulk solution (see  Section 3.2 ), but have not yet been ruled out for localized and/or non-equilibrium effects such as MIC, galvanic coupling, radiolysis in a humid environment, and extreme concentration by evaporation.  Each of these mechanisms may locally depress the pH or increase the concentration of corrosive species such as fluoride or chloride, at least temporarily.  None of these conditions are expected to impact cladding performance under repository conditions. However, until they can be ruled out, or shown to be too transitory to have negative consequences on cladding, a conservative model has been adopted to bound the uncertainty.   This conservative model uses two severe assumptions. The first assumption is that there is no filling or flushing of waste package by water. This is the worst case for concentration of aggressive species and breach of cladding.  It is assumed that ground water entry occurs while there is still significant heat and/or radiation. The water flow rate must nearly match the evaporation rate within the package.  If the flow is too high, the package will fill and overflow.  The scenario of a filled, well-mixed, overflowing package is covered by the in-package chemistry model, which shows only moderate pH reduction ( CRWMS M&O 2000g , Section 6.1).  The scenario with flushing is the worst for transport of species out of the package, but is not the worst for cladding performance.  Filling the package with water displaces the nitrogen that otherwise might be radiolytically converted to nitric acid. Overflow will flush out aggressive species, and prevent ground water from concentrating to the point of promoting galvanic corrosion of the carbon steel basket materials.  Oxygen influx is also greatly reduced in a flooded waste package, so the corrosion potential and corrosion rates are reduced, as are many radionuclide solubilities.     The second assumption is that aggressive species concentrate in the worst possible way.  Because fluoride and chloride are consumed by reaction with Zircaloy ( CRWMS M&O 2000ag , Section 6.2.2.3.2) and carbon steel ( McCright 1998 , Section 2.1.8), respectively, it is assumed that aggressive species from incoming water will concentrate where they can do the most damage.  For fluoride, this would be nearly total evaporation of incoming drops on a drop-width section of a single fuel rod.  For chloride, this would be in a crevice between Zircaloy and carbon steel basket materials.  It is assumed that the incoming water species are directed to a single rod, until they have breached that rod.  Then it is assumed that new aggressive species are directed to another single rod until it is breached, and so on. In this approach, the fraction of cladding perforated is linearly dependent on the water inflow, which generally increases with time as the waste package degrades.  Inflow, however, is also a function of other factors such as climate, location within the repository, etc.  The likelihood of significant concentration of aggressive species decreases with time, as decay heat and radioactivity decrease, likelihood of good galvanic connection to the Zircaloy decreases, and amount of reduced iron as an energy source for microbes decreases.  The trend toward less aggressive conditions is ignored, however, as it is assumed that the aggressive species concentrate in the worst possible way for all time.    Figure 3.4-9  shows an example: with 50 liters/year of water entering the WP, 20  percent of the rods would fail by this mechanism in 10,000 years of water flow.    3.4.2.5 Physical Perforation   The CSNF Cladding Degradation Component also considers physical perforation of the Zircaloy cladding from mechanical and seismic loads ( Figure 3.4-2 ).  Rubble (from the drift wall) falling onto the cladding when the WP collapses can perforate the cladding but was not modeled since WP collapse takes hundreds of thousands of years to occur.  During this time, other modes of perforating the cladding (e.g., localized corrosion) are predicted to occur.   Studies of rock fall ( CRWMS M&O 2000ah , Section 6) have concluded that credible rock falls will not be sufficient to make the drip shield contact the waste package.  Therefore, rock falls will not cause cladding perforation. Even an earthquake so strong that it occurs only once in 100,000 years would not perforate the CSNF cladding.  Only severe seismic events with a frequency of 1.1   10 -6 /year can perforate the cladding and were used in CSNF Cladding Degradation Component.  This event perforates all the cladding and makes it available for unzipping.    3.4.2.6 Other Perforation Mechanisms Evaluated (Features, Events, and Processes)   Other cladding degradation mechanisms were reviewed using FEPs screening arguments ( CRWMS M&O 2000s ) (see  Section 2.3 ).  The results are summarized below.    Hydride Failures– A review of the various hydride degradation mechanisms was performed for TSPA-SR ( CRWMS M&O 2000p , Section 6.10.2). DHC of existing cracks was analyzed using the distribution of stresses and crack sizes summarized in  Table 3.4-2 .  Stress intensity factors were calculated and have a mean of 0.44 MPa·m 0.5  (range 0.002 to 2.7 MPa·m 0.5 ); this intensity factor is below the usual threshold, which ranges from 5 to 12 MPa·m 0.5 .  Therefore, crack propagation by DHC was not expected and was screened out based on low consequence.  The calculated stress intensities are also below those needed to produce embrittlement failures (K I  < K IC ) and so embrittlement was screened out based on low consequence.  Perforation of the cladding by hydride reorientation is also unlikely and has not been included in the abstraction for TSPA-SR because of the its inability to cause significant consequences.  Stresses and temperatures are too low for reorientation to occur, and the material will maintain sufficient strength even if reorientation did occur, so failure would not be expected ( CRWMS M&O 2000r , Section 6.4).    Hydride Embrittlement of Cladding is Unlikely –Hydrogen will be generated in the WP as the WP internals corrode.  This hydrogen is not absorbed because the H 2  molecules do not migrate through the high-density zirconium oxide layer.  Available data on zirconium hydriding indicate that corrosion of WP internals will not result in hydriding of fuel cladding.    Although hydriding as a result of galvanic corrosion has been observed, cladding alloys resist such corrosion on contact with carbon steel, and, if such an effect should occur, corrosion of the carbon steel would quickly break the electrical contact between the materials.  Hydriding from Inconel contact requires smearing the Inconel into the zirconium metal matrix and then occurs only for a short time.    Waterlogged Rods– The fraction of fuel rods with breached cladding is small (~0.16 percent). Most moisture can be removed from defective rods by standard drying processes.  When drying the handling can be minimized. The impact of any residual amount of moisture is insufficient to cause significant corrosion of the internal structural portion of the WP and further degradation of the cladding.  Furthermore, any moisture available would likely be consumed first by any CSNF exposed by the initially perforated cladding; therefore, the issue is excluded based on low consequence.      General Corrosion of Cladding– General corrosion is synonymous with zirconium oxidation.  The outer surface of the cladding becomes coated with oxide (ZrO 2 ) .  Because this ZrO 2  is of high density and adheres to the surface, it slows down further oxidation.  The oxidation can be from O 2  consumption (dry oxidation) or H 2 O consumption (wet oxidation).  Once the fuel assemblies are placed in the waste package, further oxidation cannot occur until the WP is penetrated.  Wet oxidation has been studied for over forty years because of the importance of cladding performance in reactor operation.  Furthermore, the metallurgical condition of cladding while in storage has been investigated.  There was no significant degradation of the Zircaloy cladding.  Various analyses have concluded that cladding oxidation under repository conditions would not lead to perforation within 10,000 or even 100,000 years. The conclusion from this analysis is that general corrosion will not perforate the cladding during the regulatory period ( CRWMS M&O 2000s , Section 6.2.3).     Microbially Influenced Corrosion of Cladding– There is no experimental evidence that microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) occurs on zirconium metal or alloys.  The two major forms of MIC for materials being considered for containment vessels in mined geologic repositories are (1) sulfide attack through the action of sulfate reducing bacteria and (2) corrosion induced by organic acids secreted from certain bacteria.  With respect to these forms of MIC, (1) sulfate reducing bacteria do not affect zirconium, and (2) corrosion induced by organic acids is most unlikely because of zirconiums tolerance to organic acids and a wide range of pHs.  However, MIC was not excluded as a mechanism for producing locally very acid conditions and is thus included in the conservative localized corrosion model.    Acid Corrosion from Radiolysis – Zirconium is used for fuel cladding because of its high resistance to corrosion in highly acidic environments including those local environments in high radiation fields.  Studies show that zirconium has excellent corrosion resistance to nitric acids and concentrated hydrogen peroxide. However, this process was not excluded as a mechanism for producing locally very acid conditions and is thus included in the conservative localized corrosion model.    High Dissolved Silica Content of Waters Enhances Corrosion of Cladding– Silica is stable and is not corrosive to most materials, including Zircaloy.  Therefore, this mechanism is excluded.  The corrosion of Zircaloy in the presence of fluoride in silica saturated water (i.e., the formation of fluosilicic acid) is not considered to be a plausible failure mechanism because of the predicted concentration of fluorides is low and the pH is above 3.6.    3.4.2.7 Matrix Exposure Model  The preceding subsections of  Section 3.4  discuss the process of perforating the cladding.  This subsection addresses the tearing open (unzipping) of the cladding and the release of radionuclides.  The release of radionuclides does not occur until after the WP fails and steam or water can enter the WP.  The release is predicted to occur in two stages, (1) fast release and (2) wet unzipping (tearing of the cladding).    Fast Release –The fast release refers to the inventory of radionuclides that are in the gap between the fuel pellets and the cladding (gap inventory) as summarized in  Section 3.3.1.1  and the radionuclides at the grain boundaries of the spent fuel matrix.  The gap inventory of iodine and cesium is predicted to be released in proportion to the fission gas release fractions ( CRWMS M&O 2000h , p. 82).  That is, the release of iodine is 4.2 percent.  The cesium gap inventory is 1/3 of the fission gas release fraction or 1.4 percent.   The inventory of the radionuclides in the grain boundaries is also released quickly.  The amount released is determined as follows.  As discussed in  CRWMS M&O (2000i , Section 6.5.2),  Wilson (1990 , Section 3) reports releases of various radionuclides from fuel rod samples.  The samples included intact and defected fuel rod sections and bare fuel.  Wilson exposed the samples to water and measured the amounts of various radionuclides that were released during that period. After the first measurement in about 200 days, the samples were again exposed, and the measurements were repeated after an additional period of comparable length.  The fast release from the uranium pellet through slits and holes in the cladding is estimated by calculating the release rate from Wilsons eight experiments and extrapolating this release rate until the larger gaps are closed by secondary phases (approximately 5 years).   Figure 3.4-10  gives the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the fast release of radionuclides from the fuel matrix generated from Wilsons eight experiments.  Also shown is a uniform distribution of release fraction between 0 and 0.004 (mean and median value = 0.002).  This linear fit is conservative, overpredicting the release values for the lower CDF samplings.  The cesium and iodine gap inventories discussed above are added to obtain the total fuel matrix fast release fraction.  In the TSPA abstraction, the fast release grain boundary fraction is uniformly distributed between 0 and 0.4 percent for all radionuclides.    Wet and Dry Unzipping –Fuel rods with perforated cladding are expected to remain intact until the WP fails and permits air and moisture to enter.  While the humidity is low, dry unzipping could occur.  In this mechanism, the UO 2  of the CSNF rapidly oxidizes to U 3 O 8 .  However, the WP is expected to last for the regulatory period for the nominal scenario, thus the fuel temperatures will be too low for dry unzipping to occur.  Wet unzipping is modeled to start at WP failure for rods already perforated at WP failure or start when rod perforation occurs, if after WP failure.  The fuel matrix is modeled to dissolve at the intrinsic dissolution rate that is evaluated at the temperature and in-package chemistry.  The dissolved UO 2  precipitates locally as metaschoepite.  This secondary phase isolates most of the fuel from the moisture and increases volume compared to UO 2 .  In time, the cladding in the reaction region may be torn as the reaction continues.  This reaction region is modeled to be cone shaped based on experimental observations of dry unzipping.  The unzipping propagates along the rod at a rate approximately 40 times (range 1 to 240 times) as fast as the intrinsic dissolution rate of the CSNF evaluated in the CSNF Matrix Degradation Component.  It is assumed that the cladding perforation is in the center of the rod.  This maximizes the release rate.   Figure 3.4-11  gives the time to unzip a rod as a function of temperature for a fixed in-package chemistry.  In the TSPA-SR, the intrinsic dissolution velocity is calculated for each time step as a function of local chemistry, pH, and temperature.  The unzipping velocity is then calculated using a triangular distribution with the minimum, best estimate, and maximum unzipping velocity being 1, 40, 240 times the intrinsic dissolution velocity, respectively.  The fraction of fuel dissolved and exposed is then calculated for each time step.   The bases for matrix exposure analysis are measurements of gap inventories, experimental measurements of the release of radionuclides from damaged cladding and intrinsic dissolution measurements. Although unzipping has not been observed for rods in storage pools for the past 40 years, the unzipping analysis is consistent with dry unzipping experiments. Uncertainties have been defined that are based on both experiments and extremes in the analysis.  Therefore this analysis is appropriate for TSPA-SR. Although it is conservative, it is not as conservative as the assumption of instantaneous unzipping to expose the CSNF that was used in previous TSPAs.    3.4.3 Confidence/Limitations/Validation   There is good reason to have confidence in the cladding degradation analysis.  The cladding degradation analysis is based on over 40 years of experiments and observations of cladding behavior.  The analysis of initial cladding conditions is based on reactor fuel performance reports that have been published since the start of the industry.  Creep, SCC and DHC analysis is supported by an extensive experimental base.  Zirconium alloys were originally developed for use in the chemical industry to handle very corrosive fluids such as hydrochloric acid.  In water environments, continuous corrosion experiments have been performed for 27.5 years.  Fuel has been exposed in spent fuel pools for over 25 years and in dry storage research programs.  The models, including ranges and uncertainties, that have been developed for TSPA are based primarily on experimental observations.   There are constraints, caveats, and limitations to this analysis.  This cladding degradation analysis is only applicable to commercial PWR fuel with Zircaloy cladding.  Fuel reliability from reactor operation is for both PWR and BWRs.  It is also limited to fuel exposed to normal operation and anticipated operational events (events which are anticipated to occur within a reactor lifetime), and not fuel that has been exposed to severe accidents.  (For example, fuel from the Three Mile Island reactor accident is included in the DSNF fuel category, which, with the exception of naval SNF, does not account for the performance of the cladding.)  Fuel burnup projections have been limited to the current licensing environment with restrictions on fuel enrichment, oxide coating thickness, and rod plenum pressures.  Cladding degradation from YMP surface facility handling and operation was not considered.  Ranges of uncertainties have been established and conservatism was used in developing this analysis.    Based on the considerations discussed above, this analysis is appropriate for its intended use.    3.4.4 Other Views    3.4.4.1 Past Modeling of Cladding Degradation   Before TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ), YMP performance assessments did not consider protection of the fuel by cladding and all the fuel in a drip zone was available to dissolve.  This rapid dissolution was then limited by the solubility of the various radionuclides.  In TSPA-VA, the failure of PWR cladding was assumed to bound the failure of BWR cladding because the PWR cladding is typically thinner than BWR cladding.  For PWR cladding, the initial cladding failure percentage was set at 1.25 percent; the major portion of this failure (1.15 percent) was stainless steel cladding, which was uniformly distributed in all WPs throughout the repository.  PWR cladding failure from rockfall rubble was assumed to begin after the WP was sufficiently weakened (which was set in all cases at 10 5  years after initial breach of the WP).  The cladding failure caused by rubble then increased as a power function (linearly on a log scale) thereafter from 0.2 percent at 10 5  years after breach to a sampled value at 10 6  years after breach; the sample range varied between 0.2 percent and 11 percent.  PWR cladding failure from localized corrosion was evaluated using WAPDEG; the localized corrosion rate was assumed to be 10 to 1,000 times smaller than the corrosion rate of Alloy 22.  Based on these assumptions, the amount of fuel exposed at 10 6  years varied between 0.3 and 40 percent (mean of 7.8 percent).  In TSPA-VA, the fuel in rods that were failed before emplacement were assumed to be completely exposed for dissolution.  The fuel in an area below the rock or corrosion patch was available for dissolution but the remaining ends of the rods were not.  This model was not necessarily conservative.   The method of estimating the performance of the Zircaloy cladding on the CSNF has changed substantially from TSPA-VA.  Two specific phases of cladding degradation are modeled:  (1) perforation (such as existing perforations from use in the reactor and creep failures from overheating the cladding during storage, etc.) and (2) exposure of the SNF matrix over time (here evaluated by assuming the Zircaloy cladding unzips).  Many mechanisms of perforation were studied and many dismissed in FEPs.  Yet, in response to comments discussed in the following sections, an extremely conservative estimate of the number of cladding perforations over time is used to acknowledge uncertainty. Also in response to comments, the exposure of the SNF is evaluated through a hypothetical but bounding rate of unzipping of the cladding such that the entire inventory of radionuclides can eventually be exposed over sufficient time.      3.4.4.2 Comments About Including the CSNF Cladding in Waste Form Degradation Model   Concerns have been expressed in meetings of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) and NWTRB as well as in documented reports of the TSPA Peer Review Panel and in the IRSR on CLST related to DOEs taking credit for cladding of SNF and the performance of the cladding if included in the TSPA.  One issue is whether taking credit for cladding is practical and the other issue is whether sufficient information has been considered related to clad degradation.    Comments   During the 106th meeting of the ACNW, the NRC challenged DOEs heavy reliance on cladding credit, considering that the cladding has to remain intact for very long periods of time under conditions that it was not designed for and questioning DOEs ability to gather data to support related assumptions. During the 110th meeting of the ACNW, the NRC contended that the model that the NRC uses for spent nuclear fuel dissolution is better than the DOE models because it relied upon slower CSNF dissolution rates and not cladding credit.  The TSPA Peer Review Report ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.E) questioned the extent of credit taken for cladding in the TSPA-VA, noting that the credit taken for spent nuclear fuel cladding may be optimistic.     Response    NRC purposefully adopted a TSPA approach such that realistic estimates could be made on the performance of a disposal system in order to make wise policy decisions ( 60 FR 42622 , Section IV;  Rechard 1999 , p. 777).  The Zircaloy cladding is an important characteristic of the CSNF. The Zircaloy cladding on the CSNF is in good condition and has been handled carefully at the nuclear reactors.  Furthermore, Zircaloy cladding readily resists corrosion, and the modes of failure in various environments have been studied for 30 years.  Therefore, it is believed that sufficient data exist for the inclusion of Zircaloy degradation.  The Waste Form Degradation Model includes the existence of the Zircaloy cladding on the CSNF and naval SNF to provide for a realistic estimate of the behavior of these fuels in the TSPA.  The NRC fuel dissolution model takes credit for the combination of calcium and silicon to suppress the dissolution of the UO 2 .  This effect is not observed in drip tests on fuel and, therefore, not used in the TSPA-SR.  The cladding degradation model used in TSPA-VA was criticized as possibly being optimistic.  The model used in TSPA-SR is more conservative.    3.4.4.3 Comments on Modeling Cladding Performance    Comments     Questions have been raised related to DOEs ability to sufficiently establish the performance of cladding.  NRC noted during the 110th meeting of the ACNW that the initial damage and condition of cladding are important to determining the effect of cladding.  The TSPA Peer Review Panel ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Executive Summary Sections B and E, Section II.E) noted that studies needed to take credit for cladding are not available and identified the quality of data from the industry regarding cladding initial state as a vulnerability to taking cladding credit.  The TSPA Peer Review Panel also stated that the estimates of performance in the TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) rest in large part on potentially optimistic, or at least undemonstrated, assumptions of the behavior or performance of cladding including understatement of related uncertainties ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Executive Summary Sections B and E, Section II.E).  Insufficient analysis in the TSPA-VA ( DOE 1998b ) was cited related to hydrogen embrittlement of zirconium cladding, and suggestions were made related to further investigations to identify additional potential failure mechanisms (e.g., pitting and crevice corrosion, unzipping due to secondary phase formation, stress corrosion cracking, long-term localized corrosion in a radiolysis-induced acidic condition) ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Section II.G, IV.E).  It also suggested that data needs related to cladding performance had not been met ( Budnitz et al. 1999 , Executive Summary, Section E).  The NWTRB ( NWTRB 1998 , Chapter 3, Section V.B.2) expressed concern that combined interactions of corrosion products from the WP liner and outer walls, radiolysis, water, and elevated temperatures could produce a corrosive environment inside WPs that could affect Zircaloy cladding and had not yet been fully investigated.  In the IRSR on CLST ( NRC 1999a , Section 5.3.5), NRC noted a lack of direct comparison of DCCG model prediction against experimental data and lack of experimental evidence of DCCG in Zircaloy cladding.  It also noted disagreements on some constraints in the models and on the validity of extrapolating certain creep model results to lower stresses and temperatures.    Response   To evaluate all possible behavior of a potential disposal system at Yucca Mountain, DOE undertook a formal approach to develop pertinent features, events, and processes (FEPs) for the disposal system.  This approach also included evaluating FEPs related to perforating the cladding.  The DOE has proposed 20 FEPs including localized corrosion (general pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, ferric chloride pitting), creep rupture, hydride failures (e.g., DHC and embrittlement), mechanical failure due to rock fall, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), cladding degradation before YMP receives it, MIC, acid corrosion from radiolysis, DCCG, future pressurization of the rods during disposal, and general cladding oxidation (as already mentioned and tabulated in  Section 2.3.2.4 ).   In summary, the DOE has reviewed all potential perforation mechanisms and has taken a conservative view for those mechanisms retained.  Specifically, the project has included a conservative model for localized corrosion due to some unspecified mechanism. This action was taken after a review of corrosion mechanisms ( CRWMS M&O 2000ag , Section 7) identified no plausible mechanism for accelerated corrosion under repository conditions.  This conservative approach should address the NWTRB concerns. For localized corrosion, the NRC also postulates that chloride attack in pits is possible given the presence of ferric ions.  However, when the waste packages fail late in life, the potential for achieving aggressive ferric chloride chemistries is very low. Hence, this mechanism is not included.  The NRC is currently re-evaluating its approach to estimating creep failures for reactor service.  However, in regard to creep in the repository, the NRC states that ""there is general consensus that cladding failure by creep rupture is unlikely under repository conditions.""   Thus, creep is not an issue.  Again, there is consensus regarding delayed hydride attack in that the NRC that believes that this mechanism is not important under repository conditions.  The project has used a realistic treatment for mechanical failure due to rock fall and the NRC agrees with this approach.  The NRC notes that Zircaloy is susceptible to SCC in the presence of tensile stresses lower than the yield stress.  The DOE agrees that SCC is possible and has provided a conservative model for SCC failure.  General cladding oxidation is not likely to be of concern due to the long life of the waste packages and the resultant low temperatures when the waste packages do breach.  Because of the long life of the waste packages, the likelihood of aggressive conditions from radiolytic acids inside the waste package are small. Although it was not noted in the NRC's IRSR on CLST, there has been concern, noted above by the ACNW, that the initial condition of the cladding is uncertain.  This has been thoroughly reviewed in the AMR on initial cladding condition and been found to be only a minor contributor to failure of the cladding.   To evaluate the slow release of radionuclides from perforated cladding, the DOE has assumed an unzipping mechanism that conservatively bounds the possible diffusive release out of pinholes in the cladding.    3.5 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL DEGRADATION COMPONENT   The DSNF Degradation Model Component predicts the rate of degradation of the DSNF waste category and of the immobilized plutonium ceramic waste. The component was developed using  the logic shown in Figure 3 of  Standard Practice for Prediction of the Long-Term Behavior of Materials, Including Waste Forms, Used in Engineered Barrier Systems (EBS) for Geologic Disposal of High-Level Radioactive Waste  ( ASTM C1174-97 ).   The primary document supporting the DSNF Degradation Model Component was the  DSNF and Other Waste Form Degradation Abstraction  AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000j ), which in turn was supported to a limited extent by  Miscellaneous Waste-Form FEPs  ( CRWMS M&O 2000n ).    3.5.1 Model Description  The degradation rates of all waste forms other than commercial spent nuclear fuel and high level waste were analyzed in  DSNF and Other Waste Form Degradation Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000j ).  Over 250 distinct types of DOE spent nuclear fuel may be disposed of in the potential repository at Yucca Mountain.  The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and the National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program have collaborated in the identification of spent nuclear fuel ""groups"" to simplify the analysis of their effects on repository preclosure safety analyses or for postclosure TSPA.   The DOE spent nuclear fuel groups are:     Group 1Naval spent nuclear fuel   Group 2Plutonium/uranium alloy   Group 3Plutonium/uranium carbide   Group 4Mixed oxide and plutonium oxide fuels   Group 5Thorium/uranium carbide   Group 6Thorium/uranium oxide   Group 7Uranium metal   Group 8Uranium oxide   Group 9Aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel   Group 10Unknown   Group 11Uranium-zirconium-hydride.      In addition, the immobilized ceramic plutonium waste form was also evaluated.  This waste form will consist of disks of a plutonium-containing, titanium dioxide-based ceramic that will be enclosed in stainless steel cans, which in turn will be encased in a borosilicate glass matrix within the high level waste canisters.    DSNF and Other Waste Form Degradation Abstraction  ( CRWMS M&O 2000j ) provided three types of degradation models for the DOE spent nuclear fuel and plutonium-ceramic waste forms: upper-limit, conservative, and best-estimate, to provide the user of the models appropriate flexibility in their application to any particular postclosure performance scenario. A summary of the upper-limit, conservative, and best-estimate dissolution models for each DSNF group is shown in  Table 3.5-1 .  This table shows the three types of models for each DSNF group and the immobilized ceramic Pu-disposition form, the surrogate material for which the model was developed, the literature/document source reference for the model, and the  ASTM C1174-97  classification of the model. An upper-limit model predicts release rates always well in excess of actual dissolution rate data.  The conservative degradation model provides an estimate of dissolution rate that reflects the higher rate end of available dissolution data or the SNF groups or similar materials.  A best-estimate model is appropriate only when sufficient dissolution data exists and the characteristics of the waste form can be shown to correspond to the characteristics of the materials that provided the dissolution database.  For the conservative and best-estimate models, various surrogate spent nuclear fuels were evaluated for degradation behavior.     A discussion of the individual models for each fuel group is provided in  CRWMS M&O (2000j) .  The uranium fuel accounts for the biggest portion of the MTHM of DSNF.  In general, the degradation rates of the metallic uranium or carbide fuels are much higher than the oxide fuels.  Because the metallic uranium and carbide fuels degrade very rapidly in TSPA time scales, the TSPA results have been very insensitive to these rates.  In addition, TSPA analyses have shown that the overall performance of the potential repository is driven primarily by the commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste inventories.  For these reasons, the conservative Hanford N  Reactor fuel model (Equation 3.5-1) was recommended as the surrogate to bound all the DOE spent nuclear fuel groups 2 through 11.  Figure 3.5-1  provides a schematic description of how the degradation model is implemented for these groups.     Rate = 1.75   10 5  ( matrix /  U-metal) mg/m 2· day     (Eq. 3.5-1)   where  matrix is the density of the spent fuel matrix, and  U-metal is the density of uranium metal.   The Navy will provide a best-estimate model for the group 1 naval fuel, but pending this, the naval SNF will be represented by commercial spent nuclear fuel in TSPA.   The best-estimate for the degradation of the immobilized ceramic plutonium is given by a titanate ceramic model, with an exposed surface area corresponding to the geometric surface area of the plutonium-containing ceramic disks.  For TSPA, however, the immobilized plutonium inventory was averaged into the high level waste inventory, and the higher rates for high level waste degradation ( Section 3.6 ) were used.    3.5.2 Confidence/Limitations/Validation  The application of the DSNF and immobilized ceramic Pu degradation models involves the extrapolation of the models over long periods of time, which are orders of magnitude greater than the experimental test periods used to generate the data used to derive the models.   ASTM C1174-97  (Section 24), recommends that uncertainties in the extrapolation of such models be minimized through the use of models whose mathematical forms are as mechanistic as possible.  However, it can be seen from the abstractions above that the lack of any directly relevant experimental dissolution/degradation data for many of the DSNF waste forms, and the small amount of data for those which have been tested, precludes the development of a mechanistic model at this time.  Additionally, uncertainties in the data used to generate the models–such as in the surface area measurements used to calculate normalized dissolution ratesproduce significant uncertainties even in the short-term application of the models.  For this reason and because preliminary TSPA analyses have shown that the overall performance of the repository is very insensitive to the degradation rate of the DSNF, upper-limit or bounding degradation models will be used.   The initial results of TSPA sensitivity analyses for DSNF ( CRWMS M&O 1999e , Section 7) indicate that the performance of the repository is very insensitive to the DSNF degradation kinetics. That is, the use of the upper-limit model for the DSNF in the TSPA performed in that study still resulted in a calculated boundary dose well within requirements. Use of a less conservative model for the DSNF in the TSPA boundary dose calculation would not significantly lower the calculated boundary dose, because even with the upper limit, model releases due to DSNF are significantly lower than those due to HLW and CSNF.   If because of this insensitivity the upper-limit model is the only one used for TSPA analyses, then validation of the other models would be unnecessary.  Since the upper limit release model is that of instantaneous release of all radionuclides, i.e., the maximum rate conceivable, it does not require validation.  It depends only on the total inventory of radionuclides in the DSNF.  The upper limit model proposed for the DSNF and Pu disposal waste forms are, thus, impacted primarily by the total inventory of radionuclides that are present.  The conservative and best estimate models for the DSNF waste forms are primarily impacted by the validity of the uranium metal-based SNF dissolution models.    Based on the considerations discussed above, this model is appropriate for its intended use.    3.5.3 Other Views  For TSPA-VA, the model for the degradation of metallic uranium was a classic Arrhenius kinetic rate equation using parameters from assessments of SNF and HLW ( Rechard 1995 ,  p. 11-22;  DOE 1998a , p. 7-32; see also  CRWMS M&O 1998b , p. 6-69).  The overall degradation rate was the Arrhenius rate times the effective surface area.  In TSPA-VA, the effective surface area was five times the geometric surface area.  Because the degradation rate estimated by the Arrhenius equation was so rapid, the sensitivity of the results to varying the multiplier for the geometric surface area between 0.1 and 100 (thus, the overall degradation rate) was small.      3.6 HIGH-LEVEL WASTE DEGRADATION COMPONENT   The function of the HLW Degradation Component is to provide a conservative model for calculating the rate of degradation of borosilicate glass for the range of conditions (immersion, humid air, and dripping water) to which it may be exposed after the WPs fail.     The HLW model will be implemented in the TSPA-SR analysis to calculate the rate of glass degradation.  The rate of radionuclide release from the HLW matrix will be calculated by multiplying the glass degradation rate by the mass fraction of the radionuclide in the glass.  This approach for calculating the radionuclide release rate is based on the conservative assumption that the release of radionuclides is congruent with the degradation of borosilicate glass.   The model is implemented in the form of an analytical expression containing four parameters ( ,  E a , S, and k eff ; see  Figure 3.6-1  and Equation 3.6-2) and two variables (i.e., temperature and pH). The model parameters account for the pH, temperature, surface area, and the combined effects of glass composition and solution composition on the rate of glass corrosion.  Conservative estimates of the values for the model parameters are provided based on experimental data.  Implementation of the model for the TSPA-SR analysis requires input of temperature and pH data.   Consistent with the conceptual model for in-package chemistry, degradation of borosilicate glass is assumed to occur as if the glass were fully immersed although it is expected that much of the glass will be exposed to humid air or dripping water conditions.  This assumption is based on a comparison of the model that was developed for immersion (see Equations 3.6-4 and 3.6-5) to the model developed for glass degradation in humid air or dripping groundwater conditions (see Equation 3.6-7)  CRWMS M&O (2000k , Section 6.3.2).  This comparison showed that the rate of glass corrosion under humid air and dripping water conditions was conservatively bounded by the dissolution rate under immersion conditions.   The primary document supporting the HLW Degradation Model Component was the  Defense High Level Waste Glass Degradation  ( CRWMS M&O 2000k ), which in turn was supported to a limited extent by  Miscellaneous Waste-Form FEPs  ( CRWMS M&O 2000n , Section 6.2.8).      3.6.1 Model Description    Available experimental data concerning the degradation behavior of borosilicate-based glasses were analyzed to develop models for the dissolution and consequent radioisotope release from HLW glass under aqueous immersion conditions in the repository environment.  The mechanism and rate expression for aqueous dissolution are sufficiently well understood to designate the HLW model as a semi-empirical model as described in  ASTM Standard C1174-97 (1997 , Section 19.3.4).   The basic form of rate expression that describes dissolution of waste glass immersed in water is ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6.1.1):     Rate = S { k o  · 10      · pH  · exp(–E a /RT) · [1 –   (Q/K)] }  (Eq. 3.6-1)   where     Rate  = the dissolution rate of the glass, in units of mass/time  S  = the surface area of glass immersed in water, in units of area  k o  = the intrinsic dissolution rate, which depends only on glass composition, in units of mass/(area · time)      = the pH dependence coefficient, which is dimensionless  E a   = the effective activation energy, in units of kJ/mol  R  = the gas constant, which is 8.314 kJ/(mol · K) (accepted value)  T  = the temperature in kelvins  Q  = the concentration of dissolved silica in the solution, in units of mass/volume  K = a quasi-thermodynamic fitting parameter equal to the apparent silica saturation concentration for the glass, in units of mass/volume      This rate expression contains two main parts: the forward rate, k o  ·  10      · pH  · exp(–E a /RT), which represents the dissolution rate in the absence of feedback effects of dissolved silica (and other aqueous species), and the reaction affinity term (1Q/K), which quantifies the feedback effects.  Because the value of Q can range between zero and K, the value of the affinity term is mathematically constrained to values between one and zero.  A glass will, therefore, dissolve at the highest rate possible (at a given temperature and pH value) when the value of the affinity term is one (i.e., when Q = 0).  The dissolution rate will decrease as the value of the affinity term decreases (i.e., as the value of Q approaches K) until a minimum rate is reached.    Use of the form of the rate expression shown above would require knowledge of several parameter values that depend on the glass (k 0 ,  , E a , S, K) and of several variables related to the exposure conditions (pH, T, and Q).  Evaluation of Q would be complex and subject to considerable uncertainty.  A simpler bounding approach was, therefore, adopted. In this approach the affinity term (1 – Q/K) was combined with the intrinsic dissolution rate constant k o  to generate the following abstraction for aqueous degradation of HLW for the TSPA-SR analysis:        Rate/S = k eff  · 10 · pH  · exp(–E a /RT)   (Eq. 3.6-2)       where,        k eff = k 0  · (1 – Q/K)          Although k eff  is a complex function of glass composition and solution variables, the approach adopted in the abstraction is to provide a constant value for k eff  that conservatively bounds the anticipated range of the function k 0  · (1 – Q/K).  This approach reduces the abstracted model to an equation involving four parameters ( , E a , S, and k eff ) and two variables (pH and T).  Available experimental data were used to obtain conservative estimates of each of these parameters ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6).     3.6.1.1 Estimation of the Model Parameters   The approach used to estimate the model parameters can be broken into three steps.    The first step was to analyze the dependence of the forward rate on the glass composition, pH, and temperature.  These dependencies were measured under flow-through test conditions in which the value of the affinity term is maintained near one.  In these tests, the dependence of the forward rate on glass composition, pH, and temperature was measured under test conditions in which two of the variables (e.g., glass composition and pH) were held constant and the other (e.g., temperature) varied.  On the basis of the experimental results, the pH and temperature dependence of rates were found to be independent of the glass composition, within the composition range of the glasses tested, so the same values for the  , and E a  parameters are used for all waste glasses.  The values of these parameters do however depend on pH.  Analysis of the available data ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6.2) resulted in the empirical estimates for values of the   and E a  parameters for acidic and basic conditions (see Equations 3.6-4 and 3.6-5).   In the second step, a bounding value for the k eff  parameter was determined based on experimental observations of the behavior of the affinity term for test conditions that spanned a broad range of reaction progress.  Experimental data show that the behavior of the corrosion rate with reaction progress can be characterized as proceeding through three stages.  Stage I occurs when the value of the affinity term is one and glass dissolves at the forward rate for the specific temperature and pH conditions involved.  Stage I will not occur when glass is contacted by groundwater containing high-levels of dissolved silica (from dissolution of minerals present in tuff and from the dissolution of the glass itself).  Stage II occurs as the value of the affinity term decreases significantly due to the accumulation of glass components particularly dissolved silica, in solution.  The value of the affinity term (and thus the dissolution rate) cannot become zero because glass is thermodynamically unstable and cannot equilibrate with the solution.  Stage III occurs when the dissolution rate increases due to the formation of alteration phases, effectively removing dissolved silica from the solution.  The formation of alteration phases is believed to cause a decrease in the value of Q due to the consumption of dissolved silica as these silica-bearing phases form ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6.2.2).  This Stage III behavior has not been observed for all glasses or all experimental conditions and the mechanisms involved remain unclear.  It is not possible, therefore, to predict when Stage III occurs or to unambiguously predict the value of k 0  · (1 – Q/K) i.e., k eff  for use in performance assessment calculations.  For these reasons a conservative bounding approach was adopted in evaluating k eff .  After evaluating several options, an approach based on using the ASTM Product Consistency Test, Type A, (PCT-A) ( ASTM C1285-97 ,  Standard Test Methods for Determining Chemical Durability of Nuclear, Hazardous, and Mixed Waste Glasses:  The Product Consistency Test (PCT) ) test results was selected ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6.2.3).  This approach involved using the relatively short-term PCT-A dissolution rate test results to obtain bounding values for k eff  that would conservatively encompass all three potential stages of dissolution behavior.  The bounding values estimated for k eff  are shown in the leading coefficients of Equations 3.6-4 and 3.6-5.   The third step involves estimating the surface area parameter S.  The glass surface area that is available for corrosion in the disposal environment is a difficult parameter to estimate precisely.  The logs of waste glass will crack within the pour canister due to thermal and mechanical stresses generated as the glass cools and as the waste form is handled.  Cracking of the glass log will result in surfaces that may be contacted by water.  The reactivity of surfaces in the tight fracture cracks that result from thermal or mechanical stresses will be determined by the glass composition, temperature, and the chemistry of the water that fills the crack in the same way that these factors affect the dissolution rate of free surfaces.  The key difference between the dissolution rates of the glass within cracks and at the outer surface is the transport rates of reactant into the crack and reaction products out of the crack.  Short-term dissolution tests have shown that, while more glass dissolved in tests with samples of fractured glass than in tests with samples of a glass that was not fractured, the difference was less than the estimated increase in the surface area.  It had been concluded from the results of tests in which various crack widths were simulated with platinum wire spacers that ""the assumption that crack surfaces leach as readily as the external surface is unduly conservative"" ( Perez and Westsik 1981 , page 168).  However, since sufficient information is not available to quantify either the fraction of cracks that are accessible to water or the difference between the corrosion rates in cracks and at an outer surface, the conservative assumption that all surfaces corrode at the same rate when exposed to water was adopted.  The value of the parameter S is, therefore, based on an estimate of the total surface area of the glass (i.e., the geometric surface area together with the fracture surface area).  This area has been estimated to be approximately 20 times the geometric surface area ( CRWMS M&O 1998b , pp. 6-79, 6-80).  An expression to calculate the initial surface area of a fractured cylindrical glass log is:        S o  = 20 · (2 r o 2  + 2 r o  L o )    (Eq. 3.6-3)       where,    S o  = the initial exposed surface area of a glass log due to fracturing  r o  = the initial radius of a glass log  L o  = the initial length of a glass log   It is conservatively assumed that the surface area parameter (S) remains constant as the glass corrodes.  This approach is similar to that used in the TSPA-VA ( CRWMS M&O 1998b , p. 6-79).   3.6.1.2 The Abstracted Model  The bounding rate expressions are obtained when the estimated value for the four model parameters are substituted into Equation 3.6-2.  The result is as follows ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section 6.2.3.3):    For the low pH leg (pH < pH m ),   Rate/S (g/(m 2  ·  day) = 10 (9±1)  ·  10  (-0.6±0.1) ·  pH  · exp((–58±15)/RT)   (Eq. 3.6-4)   For the high pH leg (pH    pH m ),   Rate/S (g/(m 2  ·  day) = 10 (6.9±0.5)  ·  10  (0.4±0.1) ·  pH  ·  exp((–80±10)/RT)   (Eq. 3.6-5)   where,   R = the gas constant, which is 8.314   10 -3  kJ/(mol·K) (accepted value)   T = the temperature, in kelvins   pH = the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration in the water    pH m  = the pH at which the minimum dissolution rate occurs = 2.1 + 1149/T        pH m  = 2.1 + 1149/T   (Eq. 3.6-6)       as shown in  Figure 3.6-2 .    3.6.2 Confidence/Limitations/Validation   The abstracted model is designed to provide a conservative estimate of the rate (i.e., an upper bound or overestimate of the likely rate) at which waste glass will corrode when immersed in groundwater or exposed to humid air and/or dripping water in the repository.  The general algebraic form of the proposed model is widely accepted and used in the literature of waste glass corrosion (e.g.,  Strachan et al. 1994 ,  House et al. 2000 ).  Because each of the model parameter values were evaluated using a conservative bounding approach ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section  6.4), there is confidence that the abstracted model is likely to bound the long-term HLW degradation under neutral to basic conditions.  The dissolution rates calculated using Equation 3.6-5 can be compared directly with the dissolution rate of basalt glass recovered from the sea bed.  The dissolution rates of several basalt glass samples were calculated based on the thickness of the layer of palagonite that forms as an alteration phase and the age of the basalt ( Grambow et al. 1986 , Table 2, Figure 3, pp. 268 to 269).  The dissolution rates for basalts covered in sediment and exposed to Si-saturated seawater are about 0.1  m/1000 yr, which is equivalent to 6   10 -7  g/(m 2 ·day).  The dissolution rates calculated using Equations 3.6-5 at 3°C are 3.6   10  -6 , 9.1   10 -6  and 2.3   10 -5  g/(m 2 ·day) at pH values of 7, 8, and 9, respectively, which is the typical pH range for seawater.  Thus, the rate expression to be used for basic conditions (i.e., Equation 3.6-5) is conservative with regard to the long-term dissolution rate of basalt glass.   If further model refinement is required in the future, this will be accomplished by confirmation testing as described in Section 17 of  ASTM C1174-97  and/or by analysis of other appropriate experimental data that become available.   Based on the consideration discussed above, this model is appropriate for its intended use.    3.6.3 Other Views and Alternative Models  When a disposal container breaches, the glass logs may be exposed to humid air or dripping groundwater.  A model was developed for the rate of corrosion of waste glass under humid air and dripping water conditions, and it is summarized below.  The TSPA-SR analysis will not include a separate alteration model for these conditions because use of the immersion model is conservative.   In the unsaturated environment of the Yucca Mountain site, it is likely that waste glass will be contacted initially by humid air.  When glass is exposed to humid air, molecular water will sorb onto specific sites on the glass surface, primarily silanol sites, and alkali metal sites.  The amount of liquid water that sorbs on the glass will depend on the relative humidity of the air, temperature of the glass surface, and hygroscopicity of the glass surface.  The first monolayer forms at a relative humidity of only a few percent.  Subsequent monolayers form as water vapor bonds with sorbed water to form beads of water on the glass surface.  At relative humidities above about 80  percent, a sufficient amount of water has condensed to coalesce into a thin film covering the entire surface.  The glass will react with these sorbed water layers just as it does when immersed in water.  Initial reactions will likely result in the dissolution of alkali metals into the film of water.  This will decrease the equilibrium vapor pressure of the film of water and cause more water to condense in the film.  After the initial film of water is sorbed, the amount of water on the glass will likely be determined by the salinity of the water.    In an open system such as the disposal system, water vapor will continually condense in the film of saline water on the exposed waste glass as the glass corrodes.  For the various configurations in which fractured glass may be contacted by humid air or dripping water, water may drip or flow away from the glass or may accumulate over time while contacting the glass.  Once alkali metals are released into the film of water, the hygroscopicity of the film will result in continuous condensation of water vapor.  Continuous exposure to water-saturated air will result in a process of vapor condensation, flow across the sample, and dripping, wherein dissolved species can be transported away from the glass as solution drips from the glass, and fresh water vapor condenses.  The corrosion rate of the glass under these conditions will be affected by the rates at which water vapor condenses in the film, and solution drips from the sample.  These processes will affect the glass dissolution rate through their effects on the solution chemistry of the film.  The effects of the condensation, flow, and drip rates on the glass dissolution rate are taken into account in the model by the use of experimental data measured under test conditions designed to replicate the phenomena discussed above.   The corrosion behavior of glass contacted by a thin film of water is modeled as a special case of aqueous corrosion that is described with the rate expression given below (Equation 3.6-7).  Analysis of the available information ( CRWMS M&O 2000k , Section  6.3.2) indicates that the same mechanistic rate expression used for the case of water immersion can be used for glass contacted by humid air and dripping water.  The abstracted rate expression for exposure to dripping water or to humid air at a relative humidity of 80 percent or higher:        Rate = S tf  · k tf  exp(–E tf /RT)   (Eq. 3.6-7)         where S tf  is the surface area contacted by humid air or dripping water.  In this abstraction, the intrinsic dissolution rate (k 0 ), the pH dependence, and the affinity term (1 – Q/K) are combined into a single term called the thin film rate, k tf .  The use of this rate expression requires knowledge of the surface area that is contacted by a thin film of water due to exposure to humid air or dripping water and the temperature.  The parameter values for the bounding rate are:   For relative humidity > 80 percent or exposure to dripping water,     log k tf  = 9.2 ± 0.2 g/(m 2 · day)    E tf  = 80 ± 10 kJ/mol   Comparison of the model for the corrosion rate under immersion conditions with that summarized above for exposure to humid air and dripping water showed that for pH values greater than 5.75, use of the rate expression for immersion for all contact modes provides a conservative estimate for the glass dissolution rate.  At pH values lower than 5.75, the rate expression for the acid leg for immersion should also be used for contact by humid air and dripping water.  However, it is important to note that since laboratory tests results for contact by humid air and dripping water are in near neutral or alkaline solutions, no database exists to evaluate dissolution in acidic solutions under humid air or dripping conditions.   In the IRSR on CLST ( NRC 1999a , Section 5.4.5), the NRC identified that DOE has not properly considered data on naturally occurring glasses, combined with experimental data and models on dissolution of HLW glasses, to demonstrate that long-term dissolution behavior under repository conditions can be represented by extrapolation of results from short-term laboratory tests.  As stated more fully in Chapter 4, the bounding formulation of the HLW Degradation Component, discussed in  Section 3.6 , included the consideration of experimental data developed by the CRWMS M&O and other relevant data including information from natural analogs.  Natural analog information is used for corroboration (see  Section 3.6.2  and  Cunnane et al. 1994 ).    3.7 DISSOLVED RADIOISOtopE CONCENTRATION COMPONENT  The dissolved concentration component evaluates the dissolved concentration of radionuclides (or parents of radionuclides) that are important to human dose as determined by the radioisotope screening described in the inventory  Section (3.1)  ( Figure 3.7-1 ).   Doses calculated for groundwater pathways from the repository to the environment depend critically on the concentrations of radionuclides in fluids issuing from breached WPs.  While dissolution of radioisotope-containing SNF rods and/or HLW glass solids into incoming fluids provides the primary source term, the formation of secondary phases often limits the amounts of radionuclides available for subsequent groundwater transport.    The primary document supporting the radioisotope concentration model component is  Summary of Dissolved Concentration Limits  AMR ( CRWMS M&O 2000l ) ( Figure 3.7-2 ).  An important component of this AMR was the analysis with EQ3NR (a component of the qualified EQ3/6 Version 7.2b package, CSCI: UCRL-MA-110662;  CRWMS M&O 1998a ).  Ultimately though, the values described in the radioisotope concentration model reflect a newly revised thermodynamic database developed in  CRWMS M&O (2000v) .  New measurements of radionuclide solubilities ( Efurd et al. 1998 ;  Kaszuba and Runde 1999 ) were combined with a critical review of recent thermodynamic parameterizations of Np, U, Pu, and Am phase stabilities that are being used by the international waste disposal community (NEA OECD) at large.     Important components of this effort included the following.       Measurement and critical analysis of Np solubility in J-13 groundwater (see  Table 3.7.1  below). This led to revision of the formation free energy of Np 2 O 5·  xH 2 O, an important Np-limiting phase, and Np speciation data (see  Table 3.7.2  below).      Measurement and critical analysis of Pu solubility in J-13 groundwater.      Critical analysis of technetium and uranium silicate thermodynamic data        3.7.1 Models Description   The dissolved concentration limits calculation builds upon three primary feeds:  (1) estimates of in-package fluid major element composition (pH, Eh, ionic strength, carbonate levels), (2) measured (and estimated) thermodynamic parameters describing the stabilities of aqueous species and solid radioisotope phases, and (3) a determination of the likely solubility-controlling phases for the specific radionuclides of concern.  The in-package chemistry is described in  Section 3.2  of this PMR.  The thermodynamic databases that were used are described in the supporting AMRs ( CRWMS M&O 2000l ,  2000v ).   The chosen solubility-controlling phase can affect the calculated radionuclide concentrations by orders of magnitude and is one of the sources for uncertainty in the predicted concentration.  In nature, the controlling phase may either be a pure radionuclide solid phase with the radioisotope as the dominant element or a solid phase with trace amounts of the radionuclide as can occur with coprecipitation.  For TSPA-SR analysis the pure phases were chosen because in general they yield higher dissolved concentrations.  See  CRWMS M&O (2000w)  for discussion of the potential effects of secondary phases on radionuclide concentration.  The phases were chosen based upon geologic and/or experimental observations or crystallochemical arguments.  For example, uranium solids observed at ore bodies and mine tailings are used to provide some clues as to the phases likely to form when fuel elements dissolve.  For non-naturally occurring radioelements such as Pu and Np, experimental observations must be relied upon.  Where no information can be gleaned from field observations or experimental results, it is conservative to simply assume that the most amorphous and hydrated (hence, most soluble) oxide of the particular radioelement forms.  Typically, the secondary phases that form first in low temperature (T ~25°C), natural systems are poorly-crystalline oxides and hydroxides whose solubility tends to be relatively high. Over time, secondary alteration minerals tend to become more crystalline and less hydrous.  Consequently, the dissolved limits decrease.  Some exceptions to this trend exist.  Crystalline plutonium oxides can lose their crystallinity and become amorphous due to structural damage to the crystal caused by the ejection of alpha particles.  These issues are discussed in  CRWMS M&O (2000l)  for U, Np, Pu, and Am radioisotopes.   The amount of thermodynamic data available for the radionuclides, the sensitivity of the radionuclides solubilities on in-package chemistry, and the importance of the radionuclides to total system performance are quite uneven.  For example, there is a large database for U, Np, and Am as a function of many chemical environments but very little for Pa.  For these reasons, the implementation of solubility within the TSPA-SR analysis ranged from:  (1) multi-termed functions of chemistry for U, Np, and Am, (2) distributions for Pu, Pa, Pb, and Ni, and (3) constant bounding values for Tc, I, Th, Cs, Sr, Cl, C, Nb, Zr, Ra, and Sn.  For the multi-termed functions, the solubility of the radionuclide was calculated as a function of time for each simulation.  For the distribution type, a value for the simulation was sampled from the distribution and used for the entire simulation.  For the last type, the same bounding value was used for all times in all simulations (see  Table 3.7-5 ).     The multi-termed functions describing U, Np, and Am solubilities, while developed from a statistical fit to predicted solubilities, possess some deterministic meaning as well.  Specifically, the reactions affecting the solubilities of U, Np, and Amcarbonate complexation and hydrolysiswere identified beforehand.  Hence, the solubilities can be resolved into, respectively, a P CO2  and pH dependence. For many of the other radionuclides, where little data are available, use of a high value bounding solubilities does not result in high doses because of the low inventory or other factor.  Detailed discussions for each radionuclide are provided in  CRWMS M&O (2000l) .  Some highlights are provided here.    3.7.1.1 Uranium   Uranyl (UO 2 2+ ) minerals are expected to precipitate under the oxidizing conditions likely to prevail when breached WPs are initially altered by incoming fluids.  Laboratory experiments and field observations show that the most common secondary uranyl minerals likely to form in the repository are schoepite, soddyite, uranophane, and/or Na-boltwoodite.  For TSPA-SR analysis, schoepite was assumed to be the solubility-controlling mineral because:  ("
GX004-29-0524884	"A Brief History of Materials R&D  at Argonne National Laboratory  from the Met Lab to Circa 1995    By Brian R. T. Frost, director of Argonne's Materials Science Division from 1973-1984. Posted Sept. 3, 1996.    The Beginning   Argonne National Laboratory officially began life in 1946, but in reality it started when the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at the University of Chicago in 1941 under the leadership of Enrico Fermi. The thrust of the materials work at Chicago was to find ways of producing plutonium for use in atomic weapons. Glenn Seaborg, who discovered plutonium at the University of California, Berkeley, headed the group at Chicago, which developed methods of isolating plutonium from irradiated uranium, while Enrico Fermi and the physicists designed and built the first atomic pile Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1). This pile consisted of a graphite structure through which channels were shaped to contain natural uranium metal and oxide. Removing neutron-absorbing impurities from the graphite and fabricating the fuel elements were the major challenges faced by the metallurgists, notably John Howe and Frank Foote. That they succeeded was shown when CP-1 went critical on December 2, 1942. But their work had hardly begun because there was an urgent push to design and construct the Hanford piles to produce quantities of plutonium. A number of metallurgical problems had to be overcome with virtually no prior experience to draw on.     The fourth anniversary reunion on the steps of Eckhart Hall at the University of Chicago, Dec. 2, 1946. Back row, left to right: Norman Hilberry (Argonne's second director), Samuel Allison, Thomas Brill, Robert Nobles, Warren Nyer and Marvin Wilkening. Middle row: Harold Agnew, William Sturm, Harold Lichtenberger, Leona W. Marshall and Leo Szilard. Front row: Enrico Fermi, Walter Zinn (Argonne's first director), Albert Wattenberg and Herbert Anderson.     A prototype or ""semi-works"" reactor was built at Clinton (later Oak Ridge), Tenn.,  and the first Hanford pile went critical in September 1944, producing plutonium for the Nagasaki bomb dropped in August 1945, bringing the war to an abrupt end. Meanwhile CP-1 was moved to a site in Palos Hills outside Chicago and renamed CP-2, while a new heavy-water-moderated reactor, CP-3, was constructed there to test aspects of Hanford pile problems, such as radiation effects on uranium fuel. CP-3 assumed normal operation on June 23, 1944.    Enrico Fermi (left) with Walter Zinn, Argonne's first director.    During this exciting period, a number of scientists and engineers participated who were later to form the nucleus of Argonne National Laboratory, among them Walter Zinn, who became the laboratory's first director, and Frank Foote, who became the first director of Argonne's Metallurgy Division.    Reactor Development    The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which in turn established the national laboratories at Argonne, Oak Ridge, Los Alamos and Brookhaven as contractor-operated facilities, as opposed to civil service labs. Other labs followed -- Ames, Berkeley, Sandia and Livermore. Argonne was operated for the AEC by the University of Chicago, an arrangement that continues to this day. The organization of Argonne at that time was in terms of the new disciplines and the old; thus, there were divisions specializing in reactor engineering, reactor physics, chemistry, metallurgy. etc., and within a division there were sub-disciplinary units, such as corrosion, fabrication, etc. -- an arrangement that continues up to today, which is testimony to its success.      Assembly of the core of Experimental Breeder Reactor I at Argonne's Idaho site, 1951.    Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn discussed very early the possibility of developing a fast reactor that could breed plutonium from uranium. Unlike CP-1, -2 and -3, the fast reactor had no moderator, but used highly enriched fuel in a densely packed core, which necessitated cooling by a liquid metal.  From this concept grew the design of Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I), cooled by a sodium-potassium (NaK) eutectic, which was approved by the AEC late in 1947 and was built at the new test reactor site in Idaho, first producing electricity in 1951 -- a mind boggling time scale by today's standards.    EBR-I was the first real challenge for the newly formed Metallurgy Division. The initial Mark 1 fuel element contained fully enriched uranium bonded by a NaK eutectic to a stainless steel jacket -- a basic concept that survived through 1995. There was some concern that the clean surfaces of the fuel and cladding would lead to solid phase bonding, which might make the removal of fuel rods from the reactor difficult. Thus, an early research program studied diffusion couples of all possible combinations of metals. Radiation and thermal cycling  effects in the fuel were also studied, including irradiation tests in CP-3, the Oak Ridge X-10 reactor and Materials Test Reactor (MTR), which laid the foundation for future designs of metal fuel elements for breeder reactors.       An early hot cell with ""master-slave"" manipulators, which were first developed at Argonne.     The Mark II core had U-2%Zr fuel which melted during transient (rapid rampup of reactor power) tests on November 29, 1955. This was due, in part, to the inward bowing of the ribless fuel rods, which caused a reactivity increase. This meltdown required a complicated core disassembly.  The mass of solidified fuel and cladding was shipped from Idaho to Illinois for disassembly and detailed examination in newly built shielded caves. It was shown that vaporization of the NaK had driven the fuel away from the core into the coolant channels, providing an effective reactor shutdown mechanism.        An EBR-I Mark III fuel rod and assembly.    EBR-I was restarted with a Mark III charge, which consisted of U-2%Zr fuel metallurgically bonded to Zircaloy-2 cladding, and a subsequent Mark IV Pu-1.25% Al charge, which operated from November 1962 until December 1963 when the reactor was shut down because its successor EBR-II was coming on line. All of these elements were fabricated at Argonne.   December 27, 1947, was an important day for Argonne because on that date the AEC transferred all responsibility for reactor development to Argonne; this included the MTR and the Nautilus submarine reactor, both of which Oak Ridge was developing. This fully stretched the capabilities of the Argonne staff, to an extent that Zinn could initially only allocate 11 of his staff to EBR-I design. MTR and the Nautilus reactor were quickly passed on to others. Westinghouse took over the detailed design of the Nautilus reactor and  the civilian version of the naval reactor was built at Shippingport and contributed to the highly successful pressurized water reactor (PWR), which forms the bulk of commercial reactors operating today.   Boiling Water Reactors    Work began in the 1950s at Argonne on boiling water reactor (BWR) development. This grew out of a broad evaluation of reactor concepts and from the design of the CP-5 heavy-water-moderated research reactor, which came on line in 1954 and played a major role in neutron research at Argonne.  Zinn relates how an experiment to test heat removal from the CP-5 core during loss of coolant flow showed that boiling heat transfer was very effective and would not compromise core stability.        An Experimental Boiling Water Reactor fuel assembly.    This led to the design and construction of the BORAX series of reactor experiments, leading eventually to the Experimental Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR) or CP-7, which came on line in 1956, and later the Vallecitos boiling water reactor and Dresden-1 -- both built by General Electric and the forerunners of today's BWRs. The close proximity of Commonwealth Edison electric utility to Argonne was a major factor in Commonwealth Edison being the first utility to build an operate a commercial BWR (Dresden-1).       An EBWR fuel assembly in the fabrication shop with members of the fabrication group.     There were five BORAX reactor experiments, each designed to test a particular facet of BWR design. A 1959 publication by Joe Handwerk, then the leader of Argonne's ceramics group, and Robert Noland, leader of Argonne's coating and jacketing group, described the fabrication of the fuel elements for Borax-IV. This employed a thoria-urania pellet fuel lead-bonded to  Al-1 wt% Ni cladding in a plate-type geometry. The plates were mounted in a box-type sub-assembly.   The fuel plates for EBWR consisted of U-5wt%Zr-1.5wt%Nb roll-bonded to Zircaloy-2 plates, which were placed in box-type sub-assemblies. Argonne produced 930 acceptable plates, and irradiation tests demonstrated an operational life equivalent to 3 1/2 years of reactor operation.    Corrosion Studies   All of this reactor development made major demands on the staff of Argonne's Metallurgy Division. Fast reactor development demanded a knowledge of the compatibility of materials with liquid sodium and the NaK alloy, while water reactor development had very different problems in water corrosion. Corrosion studies at Argonne began in earnest with the Naval Reactor, where knowledge of the corrosion of zirconium in high-temperature water was vitally important. Argonne scientists led by Joe Draley cooperated with the Westinghouse scientists in testing the Zircaloy family of alloys.    It was also important to establish whether corrosion rates were affected by radiation. To assist in this study, Argonne installed and operated a pressurized-water loop in the MTR, mainly to test fuel plates of Al-U-Ni-Fe alloy silicon-bonded to aluminum plates, which were used in some of the BORAX cores and the SL-1 Army reactor.    Radiation Effects   Radiation effects were ill-understood both for the fuel and the cladding. The coming on line of MTR, CP-5 and the prototype reactors provided the environments for radiation tests, but this, in turn, required adequate hot cells with their associated remote handling equipment to allow detailed post-irradiation examinations to be carried out. A family of hot cells was built at Argonne-East and -West for this purpose. The establishment of a Remote Systems Division gave Argonne a strong capability for developing hot cell equipment, especially master-slave manipulators -- an early form of robotics -- the technology of which was quickly transferred to industry.  ""Technology transfer"" is a buzzword today, but the transfer of reactor technology to industry was a major accomplishment of Argonne in the first two decades of its existence.   The development of the fuel elements for the Hanford production reactors in the 1940s quickly showed that unalloyed uranium behaved poorly in pile. The orthorhombic alpha-uranium grew under thermal cycling and swelled rapidly due to the formation of fission gas bubbles. This led to a two-pronged attack on these problems at Argonne, as at other labs in the United Kingdom and France.   The ability to launch a two-pronged attack at Argonne was made possible by the realization in the AEC in the late 1940s that there was a need to fund basic materials research programs. On the one hand, technological studies of the effects of alloying on swelling and growth  phenomena bore fruit in terms of using alloying to increase the fuel burn-up limits, as hinted above. On the other hand, basic studies of the phenomena were very enlightening. An electrolytic method was developed by Bernard Blumenthal and Bob Noland that produced uranium with less than 25 ppm of impurities; single crystals without substructure could be grown from this material by a grain coarsening technique. The possession of these crystals enabled irradiation experiments, reported by Hugh Paine and Howard Kittel at the first Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955,  to show the different dimensional changes along the three crystallographic directions in alpha uranium.   If uranium seemed complex, plutonium was more so, with six allotropic forms and a lower melting point than uranium combined with a low thermal conductivity. Again, a two-pronged attack on these problems evolved at Argonne. Technological alloy development ultimately came up with U-Pu-Zr alloys as possessing good performance and compatibility with cladding. This alloy provided the basis of the Integral Fast Reactor design. At the same time, basic studies were beginning to develop an understanding of the electronic properties of plutonium and its alloys.   Solid State Science   The Manhattan Project spawned a new branch of materials research involving new materials and new phenomena, some of which fitted the traditional science of metallurgy and some the newer science of solid state physics and chemistry, the distinction at that time being in terms of macroscopic effects versus atomistic processes. As an example, the development of the graphite moderated Hanford reactors required methods of removing high-cross-section impurities ( a mix of chemistry and metallurgy) plus an understanding of radiation effects that caused graphite to swell and distort. The latter was tackled by a team in the Chemistry Division under Oliver Simpson, with Gerhardt Hennig as group leader. This led to an interest in radiation effects in other non-metallic solids, such as sodium chloride, where radiation caused color centers (atomic displacements) that could be annealed out at higher temperatures.    The solid state group in the Chemistry Division grew and in 1959 was accorded the status of a division. Plans were developed to construct a new home for the division, which culminated in 1968 in the dedication of Building 223 -- a modern research laboratory designed with clean rooms, low temperature labs (principally for superconductivity research) and materials preparation labs.   With the start up of the CP-5 reactor in 1954 neutron scattering research increased in both metallurgy and solid state science, along with neutron damage studies over a wide temperature range, including liquid helium temperature of 4 degrees Kelvin, where the defects were essentially ""frozen in"" and their subsequent annealing could be studied in detail. In the 1960s, Tom Blewitt and his colleagues in the Metallurgy Division used similar techniques to study radiation effects in metals, most notably copper. As will be seen later, this type of work was invaluable in tackling the practical problem of void swelling in reactor alloys.    Plutonium    Gloveboxes in the plutonium laboratory, circa 1959.     In 1951, Walter Wilkinson sensed that there was a growing need for more comprehensive facilities for fabricating plutonium fuels at Argonne. A modest lab for studying the physical metallurgy of plutonium and its alloys had been established in the Chemistry Building, mainly for basic studies, and this laid the groundwork for Building 350, which was dedicated in 1959 with Art Shuck in charge, assisted by Jim Ayer, Al Hins and others. At that time, it was one of the world's largest and most advanced  facilities of its kind. It included a room 165 feet long and 72 feet wide, containing a herringbone pattern fabrication line with a central spine from which specialized units branched, e.g., casting, extrusion, rolling, welding, etc.    In addition to the fast-reactor fuel elements developed there, a growing need existed for fuel plates for the critical assemblies that Argonne was building to mock up fast-reactor core configurations. ZPR-6 and -9 were built in Illinois and ZPPR in Idaho. Altogether, many tons of plutonium were fabricated for these assemblies.    Experimental Breeder Reactor II   EBR-II started out as a logical follow-on to EBR-I with increased power and electricity generation, but it quickly included a unique feature -- the Fuel Cycle Facility (FCF) -- in effect a large hot cell attached to the reactor in which the irradiated fuel elements were reconstituted by melting, which removed the volatile and gaseous fission products. What was left was an alloy of uranium with certain fission products, labeled ""fissium"". Some Metallurgy Division staff who had been involved in the initial development of the fuel elements moved to Idaho to assist in starting up the FCF. From this grew a significant metallurgical effort at the Idaho location, which continues to this day. The first sub-assembly, fabricated remotely from melt-refined irradiated fuel, was returned to the reactor in April 1965. This feature was phased out by 1969 to make way for a new role for the reactor -- an irradiation test bed for the national fast-reactor program. To accomplish this, the EBR-II project was formed in 1968 to bring together all operations in one organization. A number of senior Metallurgy Division staff, including Howard Kittel, Dave Walker and Bob Noland, moved over into that project, leaving the way open for the Metallurgy Division to hire a number of new, young staff members to begin a different approach to fuel-element development under the leadership of Paul Shewmon, Che-Yu Li, Brian Frost and others.   Advanced Reactors   Meanwhile, Argonne's aspirations as the nation's premier reactor development site continued to grow. Two new reactors were conceived in the early 1960's -- A 2 R 2 , the Argonne Advanced Research Reactor, and FARET, the Fast Reactor Experiment Test. A 2 R 2  was a flux trap reactor with a designed peak flux in excess of 10 15  neutrons per cm 2  per sec. Two factors led to its demise: the design of the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge (and maybe the High Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven), and delays in getting construction under way. A large hole was dug before the AEC canceled the project, and the hole remained untouched for more than a decade.      FARET was intended to test fast-reactor fuels and components and was overtaken by the AEC's decision to build the Fast Flux Test Facility at Hanford as a larger test reactor, a decision influenced strongly by the naval reactor experience in using MTR, ETR and ATR in Idaho for extensive loop tests of fuel and components. Thus, Argonne lost some of its momentum and leadership in reactor development and became more subservient to the centralized direction by the AEC's Division of Reactor Development and Testing. Included in this shift was the creation of the Program Office at Argonne  under Al Amorosi (one of the pioneers of the Naval Reactor program at Argonne and a leading player in the design and construction of Detroit Edison's Fermi-1 commercial fast reactor) to help plan the reactor program. Several key Metallurgy Division staff (Larry Kelman, Larry Neimark and others) joined that office for several years, later returning to the Metallurgy Division.   The Fuels Technology Center    Frank Foote (right), first director of Argonne's Metallurgy Division, at the groundbreaking for the Fuels Technology Center, Building 212) in 1959.    To retrace our steps a little, the importance of reactor materials research at Argonne was recognized when AEC permission and Congressional approval were granted in the late 1950s to build a new Metallurgy Building,     Building 212 shortly after its dedication in 1962.    Building 212, designated for political purposes the Fuels Technology Center.  This multi-purpose building -- with basic and applied research labs, high bay areas for fabrication and large-scale testing, and hot cells, (the most important being the  Alpha Gamma Hot Cell Facility, or AGHCF) -- was dedicated in 1962. It marked a transition from relatively small-scale basic and applied research to a larger scale program. Some of the larger-scale work had, perforce, to be carried out at reactors which included CP-5, MTR and EBR-II, but the samples were  returned to Building 212 for detailed examination.    Neutron Scattering Research    Neutron scattering has a long history at Argonne: Enrico Fermi, Bob Sachs and Bill Sturm did pioneering experiments around 1947 at the CP-3 reactor using a mechanical chopper developed by Fermi with John and Leona Marshall. With the start up of CP-5, there was some emphasis on diffraction studies of hydrides and deuterides of Zr, Hf and Ti because hydrogen atoms scatter neutrons well, unlike X-rays. The same principle has been applied to uranium compounds with light elements, such as carbon and nitrogen; for example Mel Mueller and Hal Knott reported on the structure of UN and UC in a 1958 paper. Later work used the fact that neutrons have a magnetic moment and are scattered coherently or incoherently by materials containing magnetic atoms. Studies of the magnetic moments of a number of actinide compounds, mainly by Mel Mueller and Gerry Lander, helped in the understanding of the electronic structure and properties of these compounds.    Interest in neutron scattering studies continued to grow in the 1970s despite the low fluxes at CP-5 compared to HFBR and HFIR. This led to the concept, espoused by Jack Carpenter, of an accelerator-driven pulsed neutron source which obviates the need for a chopper. Pulses of spallation neutrons, generated by energetic protons bombarding a uranium target, offer several advantages over reactor neutrons. The abandoned injector ring of the Zero Gradient Synchrotron (ZGS) presented an opportunity to build a bargain price spallation source, the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS), which has operated since May 1981 and has attracted numerous researchers from U.S. and foreign laboratories.     Argonne's Intense Pulsed Neutron Source.     Directors of IPNS have included Gerry Lander and Bruce Brown, who began their Argonne careers in the Materials Science Division. Materials scientists have used IPNS in the diffraction mode to study the structure of high-temperature superconductors (see below), for small angle scattering to study fine precipitates in alloys, and for deep-penetration measurements of internal stresses in structures, among a wide variety of studies. For several years a liquid helium radiation effects facility was located close to the IPNS target.   Fuel Element Modeling   As noted above, the influx of new talent in the late 1960s, combined with the growth of computer technology, led to a new approach to fuel element development based on computer models of fuel performance. Many of these new recruits, especially Dick Weeks and Vyt Jankus, became involved in the development of the LIFE code. This code described fuel and cladding behavior in a reactor as a function of time, using as input the physical properties of the components. This, in turn, indicated the relative importance of the various properties and gave priorities to studies and measurements of those properties. Detailed models of important phenomena, such as fission gas behavior in fuel, provided greater mechanistic insight and led to the development of sophisticated models that are invaluable in making safety assessments and are used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for light-water-reactor (LWR) assessments. Confirmation of the code's capabilities came from integral fuel element irradiations and from measurements of specific properties or phenomena, such as irradiation creep.   Advanced Reactors Post-1970   Reactor development at Argonne has continued to almost the present day, unlike the situation at many other national labs. The 1970s and early 1980s were dominated by the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF), built at Hanford to test fuel element assemblies, and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, a 350-MWe commercial prototype, which was never built but which absorbed much effort by the labs and industry. Argonne played a role in these developments by testing fuels in EBR-II and examining them in the AGHCF and at the Hot Fuels Examination Facility( HFEF)  in Idaho, which was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s.    Starting in 1984, Argonne took the initiative in announcing the development of a new fast reactor concept, the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR), which was based on the EBR-II scheme of a fast reactor with an integral fuel reprocessing plant. The key element was an electrochemical cell with a molten-salt electrolyte for separating the actinides from the fission products. Initial work was centered in Argonne's Chemical Technology Division, while later work -- which included the renovation of the Fuel Cycle Facility -- was carried out in Idaho. The fuel was a U-Pu-Zr alloy, which displayed good burn-up and safety characteristics. While the IFR demonstration in the EBR-II plus the Fuel Cycle Facility was ready to operate in 1995, nuclear power opponents succeeded in convincing both the Clinton Administration and Congress to zero out funds for further development and to authorize the shutdown of EBR-II, leaving the United States without a fast-reactor program, in contrast to the rest of the developed world. The Congress and DOE allocated funds to Argonne to close down EBR-II in an orderly fashion and to carry out other nuclear studies, which included nuclear waste disposal and LWR studies on both U.S. and Russian reactors.   Commercial Reactors   In the 1970s, a series of corrosion problems developed in commercial LWRs, and Argonne was called on by utilities and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to help in identifying the cause of failures in water circuits. Later work was supported by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to assist them in understanding the causes of pipe failures and in developing regulatory guidelines. Following the Three Mile Island core meltdown Argonne assisted in the examination of the remnants of the failed core, using its specialized hot cell capabilities. Currently, Argonne is assisting the NRC in evaluating the potential for extending the lives of existing reactors by up to 20 years, a very important study in view of the lack of orders for new nuclear plants in the United States for the past 15 years.   Non-nuclear Energy Systems   The 1973 OPEC oil crisis led to the consolidation of all U.S. energy research under the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). This led to a considerable shift in program contents at Argonne and the other national labs. The desire to convert our extensive native coal resources into liquid and gaseous fuels resulted in new programs to develop high-temperature/high-pressure processes, which made severe demands on construction materials. The corrosion and compatibility of steel and ceramic components with molten slags, mixed gases and hot liquids were studied in detail. The development of refractories for this purpose led to a collaborative program with suppliers of refractories to the steel industry to make and test improved products.   The desire to improve the efficiency of coal combustion spawned programs on fluidized-bed combustion and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), both of which involve the containment of corrosive solid/gas mixtures at very high temperatures. An unusual aspect of Argonne's MHD program was the shipment to Moscow of a channel, by Air Force C5A, to be tested in a Russian high-temperature institute. The program was abruptly terminated when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. A more recent activity in fossil energy has been the development jointly with industry  of membranes for converting natural gas to liquid fuels and for the separation of hydrogen for fuel cells.   Research on improved batteries and fuel cells has been a major effort at Argonne, based mainly in the Chemical Technology Division, but with strong support from materials scientists. The principal thrusts have been on a lithium-iron-sulfide battery, which operates at a high temperature at high efficiency, and on the monolithic solid-oxide fuel cell, which is also efficient and compact. The success of both  systems has relied on the development of suitable materials, particularly specialized ceramics.   Superconductivity   An exciting area of research, which has involved close cooperation of basic and applied materials scientists, is high-temperature superconductivity. For more than two decades, starting in the 1960s, Argonne had a research program on low-temperature superconductors in both the Materials Science Division and the Solid State Science Division (which subsequently merged), and had practical experience in building hydrogen bubble chambers using Nb-Ti superconducting magnets for high-energy-physics research. When Bednorz and Muller of IBM discovered high temperature superconductivity in 1986, followed by the improvements made by Paul Chu at the University of Houston, Argonne was able to mount a sizable effort in both basic and applied research in this field.    In the Materials Science Division, insights into the structure and properties of the yttrium-barium-copper oxide superconductors were quickly obtained with structural studies at IPNS being especially valuable. Methods of making superconducting wire, tapes and blocks were developed in the then Materials and Components Division (now Energy Technology Division), along with engineering studies of magnet and bearing designs and of magnetically levitated vehicles. This led to the formation of the Illinois Superconductor Corporation (through the ARCH Development Corporation, an affiliate of the University of Chicago), licenses of inventions to several companies and a major collaborative effort with Commonwealth Research Corporation to develop superconducting flywheel storage systems. Much of this has been facilitated through Argonne's being one of DOE's three Pilot Centers for Superconductivity and a partner in the National Science Foundation's Center for Superconductivity with the University of Illinois, Northwestern and the University of Chicago.   Advanced Photon Source   A major stimulus to the basic materials research programs has been the construction of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne. This 7 GeV synchrotron source, using state-of-the-art wigglers and undulators will be the nation's brightest X-ray source when it comes on line at full power in 1996. It will open up new areas of materials research because it will provide higher resolution and tunability of the beams.   Conclusion   In the past few years, the national labs have been under fire from the Congress. Their roles and even the need for their existence have been questioned. This is due in a large part to the end of the Cold War, which diminished the need for an aggressive nuclear weapons program and, hence, the need for three large weapons laboratories. The demise of advanced reactor programs has added to questioning of the role of the non-weapons labs.    The current Congress is highly critical of the need for the national labs to continue their efforts to aid American industry in competing with the rest of the world. Nevertheless, it seems that labs like Argonne will continue to exist and to play an important role in advancing science and technology. The stewardship of major research facilities is reason enough alone to justify the existence of the labs. But there are many other reasons; as the foregoing text shows, Argonne and its sister labs have the capability of tackling high-risk, long-term problems of a multi-disciplinary nature that universities and industry cannot handle. Accountability is to the taxpayer rather than the shareholder or the examination board, which creates an unbiased attitude towards solving difficult problems; ""honest broker"" is a term that is often used in this context. These are all qualities that are needed by a country with a large technological base.         Organization of Materials Research at Argonne.   In 1946, at the formation of Argonne National Laboratory, a Metallurgy Division was created under Frank Foote, who had joined the Manhattan Project in 1943. After the war, Foote returned to Columbia University for two years, during which time Jim Schumar acted as division director. Foote stepped down as division director in 1965, and Mike Nevitt took over. Meanwhile, a basic solid state physics and chemistry program started in the Chemistry Division under Oliver Simpson, and this became the Solid State Science Division in the 1960s with its own new building.    When Mike Nevitt became deputy laboratory director late in 1969, Paul Shewmon became the director of the Metallurgy Division and changed its name to the Materials Science Division, in keeping with the trend towards embracing all types of materials and not just metals. Paul Shewmon left to join the National Science Foundation in 1973 and later the  Ohio State University. In 1973  Brian Frost took over as division director.    In 1982, an attempt was made to unite all materials research at Argonne under one organization -- the Materials Science and Technology Division (MST), which incorporated MSD, SSS and elements of the Chemistry and Chemical Technology Divisions -- still under Frost. When Frost he stepped down in 1984 to start the Technology Transfer Center, he was followed by Frank Fradin as director of MST. The retirement of Bob Zeno as director of the Components Technology Division in 1986 led to the splitting of MST into the Materials Science Division, under Fradin, and Materials and Components Technology (MCT), under Dick Weeks, a former associate director of MSD and MST.  In 1987, Fradin was promoted to associate laboratory director for physical research, and Bobby Dunlap became the director of MSD. When Weeks was promoted to general manager for energy technology in 1994, Roger Poeppel took over MCT, and it was renamed the Energy Technology Division in recognition of its broader role.    The cost of doing business has changed drastically over this 50-year period. A memo by Foote, dated July 1, 1946, gives a ""Plan for the Metallurgy Divison..."" which shows a staff of 10 professionals, 10 ""non-academic"" and five shop staff at a total cost of $85,000/year. The mean of professional staff annual salaries was $4,000. By 1964, the organization chart shows seven basic research groups with 40 staff and eight applied research groups with 59 staff. The cost is not given, but it was probably around $10 million/year, because expensive facilities had been added. Today, the total number of staff working on materials problems at Argonne is on the order of 300 people at an annual cost of around $60-70 million."

References                 Abstract                Shell Chemicals is producing             a new type of polyester (Shell Chemicals is the name used to             denote the chemical businesses of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group             of Companies). This polymer is being used for fibers in the residential             and industrial carpet markets. The fiber is poly(trimethylene             terephthalate) (PTT) and has the tradename Corterra®. These             fibers have a number of traits that lend themselves to carpet             products. Shell expected to produce 400 million pounds of Corterra®             polymers for the general marketplace by the end of the third             quarter of 1999, and thus, it will begin to appear as evidence             in cases.                PTT fibers have many similarities             to, but some important differences from, the more common polyester,             poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers. The history of PTT,             its optical and instrumental characteristics, and data from known             samples are presented in this technical note.                History                Poly(trimethylene terephthalate)             (PTT) was first synthesized and patented in 1941 (Whinfield and             Dickson 1941), but it was not produced commercially because of             the expense of one of the precursors, 1, 3-propanediol (PDO;             Chuah et al.1995A). The production of PDO was halted in the mid-1960s,             and ethylene oxide (EO) hydroformylation was developed as an             alternative. In the early 1990s, hydroformylation catalysts were             created to allow for the economic formulation of PDO through             continuous EO hydroformylation. The vast majority of polyester             textile fibers are PET. Its sister polymer, poly(butylene terephthalate)             (PBT), has a very limited application to textiles (Werny and             Chuah 1996). PTT, made by Shell Chemicals and marketed under             the tradename Corterra® , has many characteristics that lend             themselves to a variety of products—superior elastic recovery,             good colorfastness, uniform dye uptake, stain resistance (Chuah             et al. 1995B), and low static-charge generation (Chuah et al.             1995A).                Chemistry and Production                                                                                                                                          Figure 1.  PTT molecule.  Click                 here for enlarged image.                                PTT is synthesized by             the polycondensation of trimethylene glycol with either a terephthalic             acid or dimethyl terephthalate. Trimethylene glycol is now commercially             producible through the hydroformylation of ethylene oxide allowing             for the economic production of PTT (Chuah et al. 1995B). The             chemical structure of PTT is shown in Figure 1. PTT has an odd             number (three) of methylene units between each of the terephthalates,             whereas PBT and PET have even numbers of methylene units. The             odd number of methylene units affects the physical and chemical             structure of PTT, giving it elastic recovery beyond that of PBT             or PET and into the range of nylon (Chuah et al. 1995B; Table             1). PTT is also dyeable without a carrier at boiling temperatures             under atmospheric conditions because of the open molecular structure,             providing colorfastness comparable to nylon with select dyes             (Werny 1998). PTT allows for additional tonal shades with pressure             dyeing (Anton 2000), giving designers more choices for textile             colors. Dispersed dyes work best on PTT fibers, yielding a uniform             color with good fastness (Chuah et al.1995B; Yang et al. 1999).

Figure 4.  Raman spectra of PET and PTT.  Click                 herer for enlarged image.                                PTT is easily heat-set             and can be spun in a PTT/PET bicomponent (side by side) resulting             in a crimp (because of differential shrinkage) that yields a             high loft but retains the other desirable traits (Chuah et al.1995A).             Core-sheath bicomponents are also being produced. Although initially             targeted for the carpeting market, PTT can be spun and drawn             at high speeds, resulting in a fiber suitable for fine denier             applications (Figure 2), such as sportswear, activewear, and             other specialty textiles (Werny and Chuah 1996). Its heat-setting             properties make PTT particularly useful in nonwoven fabrics (Hwo             et al. 2000).                Analytical Properties                PTT fibers have optical properties             like PET fibers (high-refractive indices in  n ^              and  n ll   but with a lower             birefringence (between 0.06 and 0.08).  Hopen and Bartek (1999) measured the refractive             indices of PTT fibers as 1.626 in parallel and 1.566 in perpendicular             ( n D  = 0.06). Homofilaments of PTT display lower-order             interference colors than PET fibers but higher than nylon (Figure             3), which accords with the lower-than-PET birefringence ( n D              PET = 0.098 to 0.183 (AATCC 1996; ASTM 1996; McCrone et al.1979;             Rouen and Reeve 1970). Theoretically, dichroism should be possible             in PTT fibers, but to date none has been observed.                Fourier transform infrared             spectra have been published on PTT fibers (Hopen and Bartek 1999).             To compare PET and PTT fibers, Raman spectra were collected (Figure             4) with a Chromex Raman 2000 dispersive CCD spectrometer at 785             nm excitation with Raman shifts between ~150–3000 cm –1              with a resolution of 4 cm –1 . The spectra were             white light and bias corrected. A microscope objective was used             at 40× magnification with a spot focus at about 70mW power.             The sample fibers were taped to aluminum foil-covered glass slides.             Sampling time was about 30 seconds. Other methods have also been             used to characterize this polymer (Poulin-Dandurand et al. 1979).                Discussion                Whereas no prediction can             be made about the future prevalence of PTT fibers in consumer             goods, they are currently present in specific markets, such as             carpeting. New products are being designed with PTT's qualities             in mind. Solenium, for example, is a composite flooring material             designed for institutional and hospital use that capitalizes             on PTT's elastic regain, durability, and colorfastness properties             (Bertolucci et al. 2000). It is important for the forensic fiber             examiner to be aware of the analytical properties of PTT fibers             and to be able to distinguish them from PET.

GX048-40-13224967	"Impacts of Volcanic Gases on Climate, the Environment, and People   U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 97-262   By Kenneth A. McGee, Michael P. Doukas, Richard Kessler, and Terrence M. Gerlach   May 1997     Gases from volcanoes give rise to numerous impacts on climate, the environment, and people. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are inventorying gas emissions at many of the almost 70 active volcanoes in the United States. This effort helps build a better understanding of the dynamic processes at work on the Earth's surface and is contributing important new information on how volcanic emissions affect global change.           Ash column generated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, a volcano in the Philippines Luzon volcanic arc, on June 12, 1991. The climactic eruption of Mount Pinatubo occurred three days later on June 15, 1991, and was one of the largest eruptions of this century. The climactic event lasted about 9 hours and erupted over a cubic mile of rock material. It injected a 20- million ton sulfur dioxide cloud into the stratosphere to an altitude of more than 20 miles. The climactic Pinatubo cloud was the largest sulfur dioxide cloud ever observed in the stratosphere since the beginning of such observations by satellites in 1978. It caused what is believed to be the largest aerosol disturbance of the stratosphere this century, although smaller than the estimated disturbances from the eruptions of Tambora in 1815 and Krakatau in 1883. Sulfate aerosol formed in the stratosphere from sulfur dioxide in the Pinatubo cloud increased the reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space. Consequently, the Earth's surface cooled in the three years following the eruption, by as much as 1.3 degrees ( Fahrenheit scale) at the height of the effect. The sulfate aerosols also accelerated chemical reactions that, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from man-made chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pollution, destroyed ozone and led to the lowest ozone levels ever recorded to date in the stratosphere.          Scientists now know that the ""smoke"" from volcanoes, once attributed by poets to be from Vulcan's forge, is actually volcanic gas, and an important agent of global change.      The molten rock, or magma, that lies beneath volcanoes contains abundant gases that are released to the surface before, during, and after eruptions. These gases range from relatively benign low-temperature steam to thick hot clouds of choking acid fume jetting from the earth.      The concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other principal volcanic gases include hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example: hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and volatile metal chlorides.      A significant component of volcanic gas research involves measuring the quantities of gas that volcanoes release into the atmosphere. Huge amounts of volcanic gas, aerosol droplets, and ash are injected into the stratosphere during major explosive eruptions. Some gases, such as carbon dioxide, are greenhouse gases that promote global warming, while others, like sulfur dioxide, can cause global cooling, ozone destruction, and polluted air known as volcanic smog or ""vog"". Studies of volcanic emissions allow scientists to compare volcanic gas output to emissions from man-made sources and to assess the effects of both past and future eruptions on the Earth's climate.      Volcanic gas can also be directly harmful to humans, animals, plants, agricultural crops, and property. Usually, the hazards from volcanic gases are most severe in the areas immediately surrounding volcanoes, especially on volcano flanks downwind of active vents and fumaroles. But these hazards can persist for long distances downwind following large eruptions, or from volcanoes erupting gas-rich magma.           Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) into the stratosphere to heights of 10-20 miles above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols. The aerosols increase the reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years. The sulfate aerosols also promote complex chemical reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O 3 ). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles. (figure modified from Richard Turco in American Geophysical Union Special Report: Volcanism and Climate Change, May 1992).          Health hazards can range from minor to life threatening. Exposure to acid gases such as sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen chloride can damage eyes and mucous membranes along with the respiratory system and, under extreme conditions, can lead to death. The health effects from exposure to prolonged periods of volcanic smog are not well documented, but the common complaints include headaches, fatigue, respiratory difficulties, and allergic reactions. The toxicity of carbon monoxide is well known, although it is rarely abundant enough in volcanic gases to cause serious problems. A very serious hazard can occur under certain conditions from volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and can collect in low and poorly ventilated places. Nearly two thousand people have died of carbon dioxide asphyxiation near volcanoes in the past two decades, most of them in Cameroon, Africa, and in Indonesia. Recently, there have been cases of near asphyxiation from carbon dioxide emissions at Mammoth Mountain, a young volcano on the eastern front of the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California.      Volcanic gases can also severely damage vegetation. Direct exposure to concentrated volcanic gas or long-term exposure to dilute volcanic gas is lethal to most types of foliage. Since 1990, areas of dying forest around Mammoth Mountain have grown in size and number because of high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the soils and now occupy more than 100 acres.          Volcanic gas research increasingly emphasizes the impacts of volcanic emissions on climate, the environment, and people. The principal activities in these societally important areas of research include monitoring the compositions and amounts of gases released from active volcanoes. A prominent part of this work involves improving existing techniques and developing new methods. The table below summarizes the principal methods currently used.          Fume clouds from volcanoes also contain water droplets in which acid gases have dissolved. Most of these droplets eventually fall to earth as acid rain, but while they remain in the atmosphere, they can also cause corrosion of aircraft surface materials and engines. Utility lines, communications equipment, farm machinery, vehicles, and other metal objects corrode when exposed to volcanic gases or acid rain. Persistent acid rain causes galvanized nails or lead solder in water catchment systems to deteriorate and release toxic metals into drinking water. Hydrogen fluoride gas emitted from a volcano can attach itself to ash particles. When these particles fall to earth, chronic and fatal fluorosis can follow when grazing animals eat contaminated forage.     Volcanic Gas Studies     Until recently, the study of volcanic gases required direct collection from volcanic fumaroles (vents), and transport to an analytical laboratory for detailed chemical analysis.      A new approach involves installing chemical sensors in or near volcanic vents and linking them to radio telemetry devices to send a continuous stream of data on one or more gases to an observatory. This method can detect significant short-term releases of gas that will usually be missed by occasional sampling.      Emissions of certain gases can also be measured in the plume discharging from a volcano. Scientists use optical spectrometers mounted on tripods, vehicles, airplanes, and satellites to measure volcanic gases in plumes. This equipment provides a measure of the total output of one or more gases and is valuable in measuring how much volcanic gas is released into the atmosphere and forecasting what its environmental impacts are likely to be.         Method   Applications       Direct sampling   Collection of emissions in glass containers and on filters for laboratory chemical and isotopic analysis       Spectroscopic and remote sensing techniques   Ground-, airborne-, and satellite-based measurements of gases in volcanic plumes to obtain emission rates       Soil gas measurements   Determination of diffusive fluxes of volcanic gases in volcanic regions       Chemical sensors   Continuous in-situ monitoring of the concentrations of volcanic gases in fumaroles, soils, and ambient air       Leachate analysis   Determination of the amounts of gas adsorbed on surfaces of ash         Studies by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey have revealed the compositions and amounts of gases released from many active volcanoes in the U.S. (California, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii). As an example, USGS scientists studying the gases of Mount St. Helens have determined that a total of about 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide were emitted between 1980 and 1988. Sensors aboard a satellite detected about 1 million tons of sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere during the climactic eruption on May 18, 1980. Another half-million tons of sulfur dioxide were dissolved in water droplets attached to ash particles that eventually fell to earth. The remaining half-million tons were emitted from the volcano during the eight years following the climactic May 18 eruption. Careful study of Mount St. Helens gases using chemical sensors installed in the crater along with airborne measurements of sulfur dioxide revealed periods of increased gas emission prior to four eruptions during 1984-86. These measurements allow important comparisons with sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants and other man-made emission sources.      This ongoing work is helping USGS scientists to better understand the dynamic processes and interactions that characterize the Earth's surface and is contributing important new information on how volcanic emissions affect climate, the environment, and people.
