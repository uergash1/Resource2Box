Congress, in a bipartisan response, has introduced a wide range of programs and policies to improve U.S. competitiveness. Whether focused on building a 21st-century infrastructure, stimulating technological innovation and commercialization, improving the business climate for investment and growth, supporting education and training, or promoting trade, these policies start with assumptions, often implicit, about the competitive position of U.S. industry. Meeting the Challenge: U.S. Industry Faces the 21st Century is a new series of studies, produced by the Department of Commerce's Office of Technology Policy, that assesses the competitive position of a number of major U.S. industries and the factors influencing their growth. Drawing principally from the experience and insight of the private sector, some 150 experts from over 30 organizations in industry, academia, and government have contributed to the drafting and review of the studies. Overall, the studies provide a framework for public policy that is better informed and that more accurately reflects the shifting, and often improving, competitive position of U.S. industry. This report on the U.S. automobile manufacturing industry concentrates on the Big 3 firms (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) and discusses the condition of the industry, product and production strategies, the importance of the supply chain, distribution and retailing, and conclusions and possible future directions. It suggests that, although the U.S. industry (and the Big 3 in particular) has made tremendous progress in the past 15 years, new challenges are clear as the global market, technology, and industry structure continue to evolve. For example, the fastest growing markets are in countries that are developing an auto industry of their own. And as the report makes clear, best practice is easily transferred to emerging producers. New technologies are also being introduced, often in response to the challenges posed by environmental and safety regulations. In addition, the major producers are experiencing structural pressures as suppliers produce a larger fraction of the finished product's value, and well-financed and independent organizations threaten the traditional distribution networks on which producers rely to sell their products.  Graham R. Mitchell Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Technology Policy The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 5   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  M  IT's International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) was asked to develop this study in parallel with industry reports in other sectors to provide strategic assessments of key U.S. industries to government policymakers. Drawing on the experience and expertise of several dozen IMVP-affiliated researchers from around the world and numerous industry participants, this study reports on the U.S. automotive industry in the context of the world automotive industry.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  7   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  EXECUTIVE S  UMMARY  The Automotive Industry Today: A Global Endeavor hile sometimes characterized as ""mature,"" the U.S. automotive industry continues to experience dynamic change--change that sweeps across national borders. To succeed, auto manufacturers must manage large and complex supply chains, spanning many geographic regions, and pursue opportunities in diverse national markets. While national policies play an important role in shaping the environment for local manufacturing operations and resulting products, cost competition increasingly drives the industry toward global product offerings. This report explores several important dimensions of the forces of change facing the industry and reviews the responses of the Big 3 manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) to those forces.  W  Forces of Change in the U.S. Market Important changes are under way in the U.S. market, both in the type of vehicles preferred by consumers and in the system that delivers those vehicles to consumers. Equally important, foreign firms are opening new assembly plants in the United States, and foreign suppliers of parts and components are building a domestic presence. In response to shifting consumer preferences, the variety of products supplied by the automotive industry has increased dramatically. Lifestyles have shifted toward the two-wage-earner family, and as a result, demand for light utility vehicles has surged. In addition, consumers have shown increasing interest in both safety and performance. At the same time, average new-vehicle transaction prices have continued to rise at a rate far higher than the increase in average household income, posing a serious challenge for the industry. Dramatic change is also taking place in the ""downstream"" activities of the automotive industry--distribution and retailing. These activities represent 20 to 30 percent of the value of a new vehicle and are an important potential source of cost savings. The changes in this area reflect a shift from capital-intensive operations (involving inventory investment) to information-intensive operations (providing the right vehicle in the right place at the right time). This shift is leading to the development of The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 9   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  flexible and highly entrepreneurial structures and methods to serve customers. Finally, new assembly plants operated by Japanese and German auto manufacturers have been built in the United States, introducing additional competitive challenges for the Big 3. Because of their location, they have also altered the regional distribution of automotive employment. These new ""transplant"" manufacturing facilities have been accompanied by the arrival of new suppliers from the home markets of these manufacturers. The presence of these new suppliers has benefited both the new assemblers and the Big 3 by introducing additional competition into the supply of automotive parts.  Competitive Responses of Big 3 Manufacturers The Big 3 have responded to these forces of change in a variety of ways. Most important, they have dramatically improved both the quality of their products and the productivity of their operations. This study shows that Big 3 plants improved their productivity from 24.1 to 20.7 direct labor hours per vehicle between 1989 and 1994--a 17 percent improvement. While Japanese-owned plants in Japan improved more slowly, they still remain the most efficient producers--but by a relatively smaller margin. From a broader perspective, the productivity data underline the need for continuous improvement in these areas, evidencing the convergence of average performance across the world. European plants improved their productivity nearly 30 percent, and new entrant countries (Korea and Mexico) showed significant improvement as well. Equally important, the data show that productivity varied widely within each regional group, suggesting a disparity among regional competitors in the management of vehicle production. The Big 3 have recognized that the development of new products is of special importance as manufacturers struggle to respond to the demand for product variety and low prices. Since the 1980s, these companies have shortened the time required to bring a new product to market and decreased the engineering effort required for new products. The large differences among the three companies in their approach to this challenge--in terms of the involvement of suppliers, organizational structures, and the degree of coordination among different product offerings--are explored in this study. 10 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Human resource practices represent another important determinant of the auto industry's competitiveness. There appears to be wide variance among U.S. manufacturers in this area--ranging from traditional labormanagement practices to new and unique management structures. The rate of diffusion of new practices within the United States is slow, but research presented here suggests that several important changes are occurring: (1) decreases in inventory buffers; (2) increases in the use of teams, job rotation, and worker suggestion programs; and (3) use of contingent compensation, training investment, and other human resource practices. A final area of competitive response in which each of the Big 3 is developing its own unique approach is the management of supply chains. Earlier research suggested that management of automotive supply chains was improved by the development of close relationships among auto manufacturers and suppliers who develop and produce components and subsystems. Recent events suggest a number of key issues in the management of these relationships. The nature of the relationship may vary with the supplier's degree of involvement in the development of parts for the manufacturer. Each of the Big 3 companies is pursuing a different approach in this area based on its corporate experience and strengths.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  11   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  INTRODUCTION  T  his report discusses the U.S. automotive manufacturing industry in the context of the world industry. The first section discusses the status of the U.S. automobile manufacturing industry, concentrating on the performance of the Big 3. Then market forces and production trends in the industry are addressed, focusing primarily on the geography of automotive production. The next section reports on competitiveness and product strategy, particularly in the areas of automotive manufacturing and product development, the two areas where the best data are available. The following section highlights technical areas where improvements and innovations are needed to make the next generation of vehicles possible. The dynamics of the adoption and evolution of lean production practices are then discussed. Two sections address supply chain issues looking upstream of the manufacturing plant, as well as downstream from the manufacturing plant to automobile distribution and retailing. A final discussion covers several ""social agenda"" issues such as mobility, environment, and safety. The last section provides the report's conclusions.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  13   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  STATUS  OF THE INDUSTRY  L  ike a number of long-established U.S. industries, the automobile manufacturing industry has gone through wrenching times in the past 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless, the U.S. industry is still home to the two largest vehicle manufacturers in the world, General Motors and Ford (table 1), and has been responsible for 20 to 25 percent of world vehicle production in several years since 1980 (figure 1). Over the past few years, the United States has closed the gap with Japan with respect to the volume of domestically produced passenger cars (figure 2) and overtaken Japan in the increasingly important sector of Trucks, Buses, and Others (figure 3). In this sector, which includes the popular light trucks, minivans, and utility vehicles, U.S. producers are considered market leaders. The U.S. Big 3 have recently gained market share in domestic passenger car sales (figure 4), from 61 percent in 1991 to 64 percent in 1994. Transplants have also increased their share, from 14 percent in 1991 to 17 percent in 1994. Despite these gains--which were made at the expense of imports--the United States is running a well-publicized trade deficit of $50 billion (as of 1994) in the motor vehicle sector. The $89 billion of production by foreign affiliates of the Big 3 (figure 5) is less well known, and although it does not solve the trade deficit problem, it does put the U.S. industry's position in the world in perspective. Through the past 15 years, the Big 3 have maintained the confidence of financial markets--their market capitalization has kept pace with the capitalization of Standard & Poor's Industrials (figure 6). Over the years, the return on assets of the Big 3 has generally been below par (figure 7) in spite of their efforts to increase profitability and efficiency. One of the casualties of these efforts has been employment, which has decreased substantially since the late 1980s (figure 8).  The U.S. Big 3 have recently gained market share in domestic passenger car sales.

Detroit automakers have been able to respond much more quickly to this demand for a range of models with the adoption of lean production. The average time to market or ""lead time"" of U.S. automakers has fallen from about 61 months to about 52 months--below the Japanese average, which actually increased from 45 to 55 months from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. As a result, U.S. companies can now compete with the Japanese in product development. Lead time may already be significantly faster at Chrysler than at many of the Japanese companies. However, American manufacturers` competitive disadvantage in model mix complexity creates a barrier to their ability to compete in product diversity. The continuous rise in price of new cars is an ominous trend for all automakers. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average new-vehicle transaction price has soared from $8,850 to $19,200 since 1981. Median U.S. household income, however, has increased from $22,400 to only $37,800. Therefore, car buyers now pay a higher percentage of their annual income to purchase new cars. The increasing costs are forcing consumers into alternative buying and replacement strategies--retaining cars longer and purchasing used cars instead of new cars. American family lifestyles have also changed. There are more working women, which has changed commuting and errand-driving patterns. Families once had a commuting car for the wage earner and a larger car for family use. Often now they have two wage earners instead of one, and the second family vehicle is a minivan or utility vehicle to supplement the family car. U.S. automakers have been very effective in creating and supplying this new market, excelling in minivans, light trucks, and recreational vehicles. Light trucks are not only popular in the American automotive market, but also highly profitable for Detroit's automakers. They are relatively inexpensive to build, and their price has been high due to customer demand and relatively few viable Japanese competitors. Light trucks are predominantly a U.S. market and have captured nearly 50 percent of the entire U.S. automotive market. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 21  U.S. companies can now compete with the Japanese in product development.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Another trend influencing the automotive industry is consumer preference for certain features. Consumers are choosing safety (e.g., airbags, antilock brake systems) with amenities (e.g., air conditioners, powerful engines, power steering, and compact disc players) over vehicles whose primary appeal is size and interior space. Factors influencing customer choices are performance, suitability to personal needs, and family lifestyle, safety, comfort, and appearance. Consumers are showing a taste for the practical, as embodied in the Toyota Camry and the Ford Taurus, both top sellers in the medium price range. Japanese automakers, however, have increased market share in the United States through new ""luxury"" nameplates: Lexus, Infiniti, and Acura. In addition, previously ""compact"" models such as Toyota's Camry and Honda's Accord have become larger and more luxurious.  The Geography of Production: Global Sourcing and Factory Transplants  In automotive development and manufacturing, geography plays a major role.  In automotive development and manufacturing, geography plays a major role. Historically, automotive employment has been tightly clustered, with major concentrations in Nagoya, Detroit, and Stuttgart, for example. In more recently developed infrastructures, we also observe very tight clustering--in the midwestern United States, we see a tight concentration of the Japanese assembly transplants and transplant suppliers.1 In the new transplant clusters, the philosophy of just-in-time (JIT) seems to play an important role in location decisions: All of the suppliers want to be near their assembler customers to achieve short, fast supply lines--just like in Toyota City. We also see recent trends of ""de-clustering,"" however. In search of cheaper or different labor forces, manufacturers from Europe, North America, and Japan have all built plants in Mexico. Thailand, Spain, and Eastern Europe--each quite distant from a historical automotive cluster--have attracted significant investment as well. Toyota even built a major plant in Kyushu, Japan, several hundred kilometers south of Toyota City, in search of an expanded labor base. These patterns raise a puzzle for analysts. In particular, why did JIT supply lines matter before and not now? Has a critical level of learning transpired such that geographic closeness is no longer important? Are only the suppliers of noncritical components moving south? If so, what defines criticality for geographic closeness? 1  Richard Florida and Martin Kenney, ""The Globalization of Japanese R&D: The Economic Geography of Japanese R&D Investment in the United States,"" Economic Geography 70, no. 4 (1994).  22  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Furthermore, if network clustering is important, as the Florida-Kenney work on the midwest auto industry suggests, then one might have expected the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to reduce the incentive to build cars or parts in Mexico, since free trade guarantees that companies can eventually ship south as much as they want. However, it is not clear what role, if any, network clustering has played in post-NAFTA decisions concerning plant location. What new light does this fact shed on the importance of the network clustering? All of these questions are critical to regional economic development. If attracting a manufacturing plant guarantees that a swarm of suppliers will follow, then it may pay for states to offer incentives to attract the manufacturing plants, as many states have done. On the other hand, if suppliers chase low wages, other government strategies make sense. If some suppliers go toward low wages and others must be close to the manufacturers, then governments must consider what mix of companies they should try to attract or should reasonably hope to attract. In Korea, India, Eastern Europe, Thailand, Brazil, and many other developing countries, the growth rate of automotive sales now far outpaces those of the traditional automotive manufacturing and consuming areas of Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Furthermore, these developing countries typically want to fill domestic demand with domestic production, driving multinational automobile firms and suppliers to develop local manufacturing capabilities to serve local markets. Following the policies that these governments pursue and watching how automobile and supplier companies respond to these government initiatives will be informative for U.S. policy makers, who may also be concerned with automotive employment shifts.  If some suppliers go toward low wages and others must be close to the manufacturers, then governments must consider what mix of companies they should try to attract or should reasonably hope to attract.  Foreign Transplants in the United States The combination of high national productivity and the relative decrease in value of the dollar against the yen and the deutsche mark has made the United States a more attractive manufacturing site for foreign automakers. This development has provided a new source of investment, jobs, and training for Americans. Moreover, the transplant assemblers are significantly influencing the U.S. automotive supply base, both by encouraging traditional Japanese and German suppliers to set up transplant operations and by inciting the traditional U.S. suppliers to become more competitive. These improvements to the supply base, driven in part by the Japanese transplants, in turn benefit the Big 3. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 23   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The transplants represent an enormous positive economic impact for the United States, compared with having that many vehicles imported from Japan, for example.  The Japanese-transplant assemblers in North America have continued to expand their production and are now approaching a volume of three million cars and light trucks per year (up from two million units in 1991). The transplants represent an enormous positive economic impact for the United States, compared with having that many vehicles imported from Japan, for example. These investments have helped the Japanese companies as well, which would be in far deeper trouble had they not diversified their manufacturing base outside the high-priced labor and parts markets in Japan. The displacement of Big 3 employment and production with transplant production is more difficult to assess. In the main, it has decreased the financial and market dominance of the Big 3, although none are currently threatened with survival concerns. It has also affected the geography of automotive employment within the United States.  Investment in Developing Countries In the foreseeable future, most automotive demand in the United States, Japan, and Western Europe will be for replacement vehicles. Demand will be flat or grow slowly. In the developing world, however, demand is skyrocketing, and many governments are requiring the establishment of domestic production to satisfy this demand. As a result, the world's major multinational auto companies are pouring significant fractions of their investment funds into capacity in China, India, South America, and Southeast Asia. For example, Ford is spending approximately $1 billion to set up factories in China and Southeast Asia. General Motors (GM) has invested heavily in building up China's part-making facilities. Last fall, GM pledged a fresh $130 million for three parts facilities in Shanghai. Overall, GM has agreed to set up 25 components-making ventures valued in hundreds of millions of dollars in China. GM also has been chosen to participate in a $1 billion deal to make luxury cars in China and has announced a $1 billion assembly plant investment in Thailand. In Southeast Asia, the Japanese have a huge lead and are likely to continue dominating that market. India and China are still wide open, with GM, Chrysler, Peugeot-Citron (PSA), Isuzu, and Volkswagen having early status in China. The Europeans and Americans are probably stronger in Latin America than the Japanese. All of these markets are in early stages of development, however, and significant change should be expected. All of the major players seem to be seeking to craft a global strategy aimed at the developing world, and these areas will be critical battlegrounds in the coming decade.  24  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  COMPETITIVENESS  AND  P  RODUCT  S  TRATEGY  ne of the most critical issues for the automotive industry today is competitiveness in cost, quality, and product offerings. Companies cannot survive in today's market if they neglect any of these areas. In The Machine That Changed the World, published in 1990, the International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) documented significant differences in these areas between the best- and worst-performing plants and companies. Since that time, differences between the United States and Japan in productivity and quality have shrunk and effectively disappeared in new product development lead time, pointing to a dramatic overall improvement in the competitive position of the Big 3 firms.  O  Manufacturing Plant Performance The automobile is one of the most complex consumer products in existence. The automotive manufacturing process serves as the ""moment of truth"" for the entire design, development, supply chain, and manufacturing process. If the parts do not fit when the manufacturer attempts to put them together, the system has a defect that must be tracked down and eliminated. Thus, auto companies focus a great deal of attention on understanding and improving the manufacturing process. Across the world auto industry, the differences in regional averages in quality, productivity, and diversity are declining. Within regions, however, the variance in performance is high, with large gaps between the best and worst plants. Below, we report highlights from the assembly plant performance research, both from the study of 1989 (Round 1) and from the recent replication and expansion of the analysis with 1994 data (Round 2). Productivity Performance In 1986, the IMVP developed an innovative methodology for normalizing differences in vehicle designs and plant practices to enhance comparison of productivity among plants making different vehicles with a variety of manufacturing practices and methods. This methodology has been improved in the 1990s and, we believe, allows reasonable comparisons across disparate plants and vehicles. Due to widespread improvement in North American manufacturing plants, the performance gap between average U.S. and Japanese plants has narrowed considerably. Big 3 plants are not the only ones that have improved over this period. Korean plants and Japanese plants in North America have shown considerable gains. European plants have shown The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 25  The automobile is one of the most complex consumer products in existence.  Due to widespread improvement in North American manufacturing plants, the performance gap between average U.S. and Japanese plants has narrowed considerably.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 9. Scale = Weighted Productivity Averages for Matched Sample of Plants, 1989 and 1994  the greatest percentage improvement in productivity of any region, partly because of a strong push toward adoption of lean production and partly because they had lagged so far behind the Japanese and North American plants. Figures 9 through 13 depict international productivity trends from 1989 to 1994. The full 1989 sample comprises 62 plants from 24 companies and 20 countries, while the full 1994 sample comprises 75 plants from 20 companies and 20 countries. Figure 9 shows that the U.S.-owned (Big 3) plants in North America (both United States and Canada) improved their productivity by 17 percent-- from 24.1 to 20 hours per vehicle. In comparison, Japanese-owned plants in Japan showed only a 5.8 percent improvement over this period, from 15.6 to 14.7 hours per vehicle. However, the relatively low percentage improvement of the Japanese plants cannot be construed too negatively. The Japanese still produce cars faster than any other manufacturer, and on average they assemble a car over five hours faster than the Big 3 (i.e., in 25 percent less time). In addition, these averages mask far greater gains achieved by some Japanese plants, such as Toyota's RAV4 line in Motomachi. 26 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 10. Productivity Performance within Regional Group, 1994  Improvements for groups of plants other than the Big 3 were also impressive. European plants made a nearly 30 percent gain in productivity, dropping their hours per vehicle from 37.8 to 26.5--about where the U.S. automakers were five years ago. Among the plants in new entrant countries (mostly in Korea but also in Mexico, Taiwan, and Brazil), productivity increased by nearly 14 percent, from 34.4 to 29.6 hours per vehicle-- not far behind the current European average. Japanese-owned plants in North America, the ""transplants,"" improved their productivity by 19.5 percent. The regional averages above conceal considerable variation in productivity across plants within each region. Figure 10 reveals the extent of this variation, showing the average, minimum, and maximum hours per vehicle for plants in each region. The range is quite large in some regions--the best plant in Japan is more than twice as productive as the worst plant, and the same is true among Big 3 plants. This fact suggests major differences across plants within these countries. Indeed, differences in company-level capabilities are likely to be far more significant for productivity than country differences. Thus Europe's wide range of productivity performance may reflect its range of company capabilities more than its country differences. The smallest range is found among the The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 27  Improvements for groups of plants other than the Big 3 were also impressive.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Japanese transplants, which may reflect their common status as greenfield plants adjusting to the U.S. context. Quality Performance  Much of the quality gap between Japanese companies and their American and European competitors has been closed.  Quality performance trends are similar to those for productivity. Much of the quality gap between Japanese companies and their American and European competitors has been closed. However, the variation among plants in each regional group is large. (At this point, all quality data refer only to vehicles sold in the United States. No comparable data exist for vehicles sold in other regions.) The dominant trend in figure 11 is convergence toward a quality level of 60 defects per 100 vehicles, with the exception of the new entrant group of plants whose quality worsened over this period. The greatest improvement is shown by European plants (33 percent) and by Big 3 plants in North America (26.7 percent). While this improvement closed much of the quality gap with Japanese competitors, Japanese plants improved in Japan (13 percent fewer defects) and in North America (18 percent fewer defects) during this period. The North American transplants have eliminated any gap in quality performance with their sister plants in Japan. The other notable trend is the worsening quality at the new entrant plants. From 1989 to 1991, defects increased nearly 50 percent, primarily because of a period of labor conflict in the Korean industry following national political changes. The Korean automakers are already showing signs of returning to more competitive levels of quality, although they still lag behind the other regional groups. Figure 12 shows the range of quality within each region. Here the range of performance within regions is even greater than for productivity. A wide range exists for the Japanese companies in Japan, with a threefold difference in the number of defects per 100 vehicles between the best and worst plants. While the best Japanese companies have grown stronger in terms of quality performance, the pressures of the extended recession on the Japanese industry are reflected in quality problems for the weaker companies. The range in quality performance is also quite wide for the Big 3 plants in North America, with a nearly three-to-one differential in defects between the worst and best plants. While some of this variation is specific to certain types of products (e.g., sports cars tend to have the highest number of reported defects), overall it reflects persistent differences in plant capabilities for achieving quality. The narrowest range in performance for quality is for the European plants. 28 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 11. Quality Levels across Regions, 1989 and 1994  Figure 12. Range of Quality Performance within Regions, 1994  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  29   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Plants that improve quality through inspection will not only incur higher costs but will also have less long-term continuous improvement in quality than those that eliminate the sources of problems.  The divergence in quality performance reflected at the regional level may also reflect differences in company strategies for achieving quality. Some plants and companies, in the United States and elsewhere, have boosted quality through additional expenditures on post-process inspection and repair; others have been more successful at building it right the first time. Plants that improve quality through inspection will not only incur higher costs but will also have less long-term continuous improvement in quality than those that eliminate the sources of problems. Making Multiple Product Lines in a Single Plant The strategic advantages of manufacturing flexibility (the ability to assemble multiple product lines in a single plant) have been widely discussed over the past decade. Companies that are able to produce a variety of products in their manufacturing plants have a number of advantages. Such plants are an important resource for a company with a product development strategy of high variety. In addition, flexibility enables plants to respond more effectively to changes in their competitive environment. The manufacturing plants with the highest levels of product variety have typically been those that produce many different models for export-- Japanese plants in Japan and European plants. Big 3 plants in North America have typically been dedicated to one or a few models. The Japanese transplants started their operations in North America with low product variety while they established their production system philosophy and have slowly increased variety over time. Figure 13 shows the regional averages in the IMVP's International Assembly Plant Study, Round 2, for product variety (model mix complexity) based on the number of different platforms (e.g., the core design, comprising a common chassis and wheelbase), different models (e.g., Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable), and different body styles (e.g., two-door, fourdoor) built in a given plant. Model mix complexity is quite high for Japanese plants in Japan, with the next highest complexity level among plants in Europe and the Japanese transplants. Big 3 plants in North America and new entrant plants have lower levels of product variety. Japanese plants in Japan, which are highest in both quality and productivity, are also highest in flexibility. These data reinforce the earlier finding that the firms need not choose among these objectives, but can instead find strategies whereby the objectives are mutually reinforcing.  Flexibility enables plants to respond more effectively to changes in their competitive environment.  30  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 13. Model Mix Complexity, 1994  Summary on Manufacturing Plant Performance Japanese plants are still the best at automotive manufacturing by our evaluation standards. However, the gaps are rapidly closing, and the rising yen has eliminated any cost advantages that Japan once had. Like many others, the manufacturing segment of the business has become increasingly competitive. No firm can relax its efforts for continual and significant improvement.  Product Development Performance Automakers continually face the challenge to create ""best in class"" vehicles and maintain a corporate reputation for performance and value. To achieve this goal, they must be adept at managing the development process, including involving suppliers as design partners. Product development includes understanding customer needs and desires; translating those needs into ""key characteristics""; developing the concepts, systems, components, and tools to deliver those key characteristics; and designing the immense logistical systems required to deliver vehicles in quantity at competitive cost and quality. Over the past decade, U.S. automakers have popularized the minivan and sport utility/light truck vehicle classes. Continued success will result from The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 31  The manufacturing segment of the business has become increasingly competitive. No firm can relax its efforts for continual and significant improvement.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  attention to demographic trends, customer tastes, design innovation, and transportation needs. American automakers must maintain the simultaneous abilities to advance the state of the design art, respond to new or latent purchaser demands, and continually refine existing vehicle types. Automotive firms continually explore better ways to organize themselves to perform these challenging product development functions. This section describes some of those organizational strategies as well as performance outcomes. Alternate Development Structures Four patterns or strategies of vehicle development management practice are described below: functional management; single-car project management; multiproject management; and multifirm, multiproject management. Functional management is characterized by teams of specialists within largely independent and isolated technical and business areas following sequential development phases to create a new product.  Multifirm, multiproject management requires the complicated act of juggling component sharing arrangements, joint project ventures, and agreements to market cars under each other's brand names.  Single-car project management is the use of overlapped, integrated functions and program phases to improve communication and lessen the amount of change and re-work caused by changed or incompatible design priorities. Typically, this management structure is associated with a project manager who has significant authority and responsibility over the entire team developing the vehicle. Multiproject-management attempts to leverage the advantages of single project management on multiple projects. Firms develop a portfolio of vehicle products with common features or a related design. Various products are related in terms of platform architecture, component families, and development lineage. Multifirm, multiproject management, under which a firm integrates its development and operational activities with those of other firms, is the most difficult and demanding product management strategy. Multifirm, multiproject management requires the complicated act of juggling component sharing arrangements, joint project ventures, and agreements to market cars under each other's brand names. To support multiproject management, the basic design of one vehicle platform is often leveraged for another through the process of ""rapid design transfer,"" in which major structures or assemblies are reused in 32 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  follow-on projects. The benefits of such practices are greater product variety, lower average design age throughout the corporate vehicle portfolio, more efficient use of development resources, and a higher level of component commonality. The difficulties include cross-project coordination and design compromises that yield multiproduct savings but distinct vehicles. A number of firms have installed a heavyweight coordinator who serves as the executive manager over a set of projects in order to address the delicate balance between individual projects and linked platforms. Product Development Performance Metrics The research team of Ellison, Clark, Fujimoto, and Hyun2 has developed a rich database to examine product development performance over the past decade. In comparing new product development practices in the United States, Europe, Japan, and Korea, they have collected data on two key measures of performance for automotive product development projects: total engineering hours devoted to the development project and total months of lead time from concept to market for new vehicle projects. The metrics calculated from the raw data are adjusted for factors such as product complexity, new parts content, and supplier development content in an attempt to approximate an ""apples to apples"" comparison. In table 2, these performance measures are grouped and averaged by geographic location of the corporate owners of the developing company. The data are based on a sample of 29 new car projects developed in the 1980s and 27 different new car projects in the 1990s. The results show that U.S. and European firms have made significant gains, catching up completely with the Japanese in lead time but still trailing in the total number of engineering hours required to develop a new vehicle. Ellison et al. also observe a continuing shift toward ""heavier"" project management systems, in which the functional and technical organizations have relatively less power in the matrix management structure than the car project team leaders. This practice was described in earlier work by Clark and Fujimoto as being significantly associated with superior performance.3 The use of suppliers in the development process, another practice associated with superior performance, has increased in the past decade. 2  U.S. and European firms have made significant gains, catching up completely with the Japanese in lead time but still trailing in the total number of engineering hours required to develop a new vehicle.  3  David J.

U.S. gains in performance result from fundamental changes in the way projects are managed, including more interdisciplinary participation by more closely linked development teams, greater and more effective use of information technology, and greater delegation of project responsibility by corporate management. Trends in the practices of the foreign competitors show an important part of the overall picture. Japanese trends show a strong emphasis on total product quality (e.g., launch of Acura, Lexus, Infiniti), perhaps at the expense of lead time and development productivity (total engineering hours per development project). However, in part because of the rise in the value of the yen, the pendulum between ""cost is no object"" quality and cost-effectiveness is rapidly swinging toward the latter. Nevertheless, the Japanese demonstrate a strong command of the link between product design and lean production. The European firms show lower rates of improvement at all levels, likely the result of a later and slower shift from traditional functional organization to project management. The Koreans have emerged as very competitive automakers in terms of lead time and development productivity, but lag significantly in quality.  Big 3 Assessment The current sales success of the U.S. industry exploits some temporary conditions (e.g., exchange rates, popularity of traditional product types, cyclical market upturn). It is not due solely to elimination of previous corporate weaknesses.  34  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The U.S. automobile industry has made significant operational improvements but still lags in mastery of the overall product development process. It is still not as adept at product development as certain competitors are, especially the Japanese (see corporate strategies and structures of the Big 3, discussed below). U.S. automakers should not rest on temporary success. The U.S. industry should avoid riding current good fortune and assuming that it will ensure continued success. Developing a robust product development infrastructure involves a number of initiatives: eliminating duplication in product development assets through reorganization, globalization, and alliances; developing platform and component set strategies across a portfolio of vehicle projects; defining critical areas of firm expertise and focus; creating strategic links to technology suppliers; and improving the way ""lessons learned"" are fed back into an interdisciplinary organization focused on new product development. Customer demand for high levels of product quality, safety, reliability, and sophistication, even in the most economical vehicle classes, poses a major challenge, particularly in an information climate that rapidly disseminates reports on good and bad product attributes. Implications of Vehicle Development Management Practices among the Big 3 There are enormous differences in how the Big 3 manage product development. Chrysler Corporation Chrysler's strategy emphasizes lean domestic product development featuring high integration with its suppliers and an increasing export focus. Chrysler has five platform teams that cover all U.S.-sourced products. All except Jeep and Truck are located in its new billion-dollar Chrysler Technical Center. Chrysler's U.S.-sourced product portfolio is limited to eight mass-production platforms. Its Diamond Star/Mitsubishi alliance is structured primarily to fill gaps in its model line. Chrysler produces exports to increase the utilization of U.S. plants and to build profits. The company has limited foreign production (minivans and Jeeps in Europe, Jeeps in China). Chrysler has a high level of component outsourcing (about 70 percent). Its suppliers are increasingly engineering large built-up assemblies, such as complete instrument clusters. There is also growing reuse of components across platforms (e.g., engines across Neon JA model platforms). Its The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 35  The current sales success of the U.S. industry exploits some temporary conditions. It is not due solely to elimination of previous corporate weaknesses.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  corporate structure incorporates a service function, platform teams, Tech Clubs, and a flattened organizational hierarchy. Chrysler's corporate staff functions as a service organization for platform teams, manufacturing, and shareholders by allocating resources, setting strategic goals, and managing infrastructure. It avoids interfering with platform teams. The platform teams take clear responsibility for vehicle development, subject to corporate-allocated budget and vehicle design intent. Interdisciplinary activity is high in engineering, marketing, finance, styling, and manufacturing. Supplier participation is coordinated with the total design effort. There is consensus management of tradeoffs. The Chrysler Technical Center supports start-to-finish platform development with modern test facilities. Chrysler's Tech Clubs--personnel working in the same system or component area (e.g., wiring, brakes, audio)--represent a ""virtual"" functional organization that maintains and disseminates technical knowledge across platform lines. Chrysler's flattened hierarchies have only five basic engineering grades (the original LH model project had one vice president, one general manager, five executive engineers, 25 managing engineers, and an engineering staff). Ford Motor Company Ford's global strategy, Ford 2000, has integrated global operations with global product alliances, segment management, and world-class timing. The Mondeo/Contour/Mystique ""World Cars"" are interlinked in Ford's Corporate Design network. Ford has a wide variety of alliances with Mazda (Escort and 323, Ranger and B2000, Explorer and Navajo), Nissan (Villager and Quest), Volkswagen (European Minivan), and Kia (Aspire), and there are corporate synergies with Jaguar and Aston-Martin. Ford's segment management divides each market by vehicle size and drive type and teams segment managers with vehicle program managers to identify and fill market niches from a joint business and technical perspective. Ford is proficient at low-cost, high-quality manufacturing. However, Ford's own extensive benchmarking against Toyota and Chrysler has indicated both higher product development cost and deficiencies in its time to market. Its world-class timing initiative seeks to standardize the vehicle development process and shorten time to production (43 months or less from Program Definition to Job #1 for single body-style programs; 48 months or less for multiple body-style programs).  Chrysler's corporate staff functions as a service organization for platform teams, manufacturing, and shareholders by allocating resources, setting strategic goals, and managing infrastructure.  Ford is proficient at low-cost, high-quality manufacturing.  36  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Ford's corporate structure comprises Automotive Operations, Vehicle Program Centers, and a balance of home organizations and dedicated teams. Ford Automotive Operations unites North American Automotive Operations and Ford of Europe, building on economies of scale from common systems such as the Ford Corporate Design network, its Worldwide Engineering Release System, and the Purchasing Release System. The rest of its operations are expected to follow in time. Ford's five Vehicle Program Centers in the United States and Europe divide development responsibility by vehicle size and drive type (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive) to supply global markets. Models are designed to carry high feature content to satisfy a variety of customer tastes. Ford is attempting to arrive at a balance of power between core engineering groups and dedicated program teams. It encourages both advanced systems and technologies as well as highly marketable vehicles. Ford consciously avoids the Chrysler platform team model because management feels it fails to leverage Ford's central technical strengths and support a broad, interlinked vehicle portfolio. General Motors Corporation The strategy of GM is multifold, maintaining a coherent product portfolio, ""Voice of the Customer"" research, a standardized four-phase development process, strategic links between its North American and international operations, and organizational revitalization. GM's North American Operations Car Platforms and Truck Platforms have replaced the former Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada, Buick-OldsmobileCadillac, and Truck and Bus groupings. GM's Platform rationalization is under way to support each brand's mission and achieve greater commonality of platforms and components. GM is aiming at unique variations on flexible engineering themes rather than a proliferation of unique systems (e.g., from 200 steering column designs in 1993 models to 50 in 19972000 models). GM has assigned a disciplined, mandatory application of a four-phase vehicle development process to all new products. GM is making an increased effort to listen to the ""Voice of the Customer"" through Needs Segmentation market research--designing future vehicles to fit groups of people desiring similar attributes rather than predetermined size- and price-based market segments. GM's intensive consumer research has included over a million interviews since 1986.  GM's intensive consumer research has included over a million interviews since 1986.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  37   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  GM's structure is a matrix organization, with a Vehicle Launch Center and Centers of Expertise. GM's North American new product development (NPD) organization is run by four ""heavyweight"" executives, one each for engineering and design operations (Small Car Group, Midsize & Large Car Group); truck platforms (Matrix of Marketing Divisions-- brands like Chevrolet and Pontiac); platform divisions; and vehicle groups (Small Car and Midsize & Large Car Groups). The Vehicle Launch Center (VLC) monitors the first two years of vehicle development process (program proposal, concept development, and technology application) as the initial home for each new dedicated platform team. It co-locates the team with centralized marketing, engineering, manufacturing, planning, and design staff resources. The VLC acts as storehouse of NPD knowledge and has enforced documentation and business management practices. GM's five North American Operations Technical Centers for design, engineering, manufacturing, research and development, and quality hold Centers of Expertise and support the Vehicle Launch Center with central staff experts and personnel loaned to platform teams. Development Organizations in the ""Design Cultures"" of the Big 3 Considered innovative, Chrysler Corporation's design culture is informal, direct, collaborative, and collegial. Design innovations are owned by the entire team and are taken up as challenges by engineering. At Chrysler, there is intense concentration of activities on a single project at a time with high group identification and few personality-driven product changes. The product design team maintains close working relationships between disciplines and with suppliers, has one-third union participants on the platform team, and maintains longer supplier relationships than the other companies in the Big 3. Ford's design culture may be described as academic and introspective, but it is also pragmatic, with its business and technical groups in beneficial give-and-take with one another. Individual Ford employees must develop networks across the company`s large and complex organization to effectively carry out their tasks. Ford spends more time than Chrysler at process and organizational introspection, perhaps a result of having a greater number of technical and business specialists not directly engaged in platform activities. Ford also supports substantially more infrastructure than Chrysler, but less than GM.  At Chrysler, there is intense concentration of activities on a single project at a time with high group identification and few personalitydriven product changes.  Ford's design culture may be described as academic and introspective, but it is also pragmatic, with its business and technical groups in beneficial give-and-take with one another. 38  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  The culture of GM has, to some extent, been characterized by extended chains of command, a complex matrix organization, and competition for resources. GM is attempting to address these issues and to improve communication throughout its organization. As a result, there have been substantial increases in communication and teamwork between GM's marketing and technical staffs. Impacts of Cultural Organization and Product Development Strategies of the Big 3 The product development strategies of the Big 3 are the result of decades of corporate practice increasingly influenced by foreign competition and other external factors. The response of each of these companies is reflected in its corporate culture and performance. Each of the Big 3 defines its issues differently than the other two, and the implications of these definitions are similarly divergent. Chrysler Corporation Of the Big 3, Chrysler has the highest per-vehicle profits and lowest break-even point, allowing it to expand its product portfolio and manufacturing capacity despite lingering concerns over quality. Chrysler has less infrastructure than the other Big 3. Its vehicle mix is more skewed toward high-profit minivans, and its sport utility vehicles contribute to its high net per-vehicle profit. The Neon platform, two manufacturing plants, and a new stamping facility were developed in 31 months for approximately $1.3 billion (an improvement over the LH platform--Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision, Dodge Intrepid--for which one plant and a retooled stamping facility were developed in 39 months at a cost of $1.6 billion). Ford Motor Company Ford and GM have much broader vehicle portfolios than Chrysler. Ford's vehicle mix is less heavily weighted toward high-profit minivans and SUVs. Ford has performed well, with strong sales but poor net per-vehicle profit and high warranty costs in 1994. Its CDW-27 (Mondeo) World Car program was costly, and its introduction of the new minivan (Windstar) was quickly leapfrogged by Chrysler's completely revamped minivan line. Ford's organizational structure and corporate culture--for example, its history of vehicle champions--have slowed its efforts to create cohesive and dedicated program teams. However, Ford's management is aware of the need to make lines of decision-making more direct and quicker, and organizational changes are in process.  There have been substantial increases in communication and teamwork between GM's marketing and technical staffs.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  39   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  General Motors Corporation GM is attempting to be more responsive to the demands of the marketplace. Oldsmobile is furthest along in remaking itself in Saturn's image as a model of customer responsiveness. The Corsa model is a de facto World Car. The Saturn has been a cultural and sales success, although only a limited financial success. In terms of performance, GM has had the lowest net per-vehicle profits of the Big 3, with continued problems in its minivan and family car markets and problems increasing content from its outside suppliers. Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Geo are below average in J.D. Power's Vehicle Dependability Study on five-year quality. But GM quality has been steadily improving: Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile are in the top ten of the same study. Also, in some key segments (e.g., midsize car [Lumina] and small car [Citation]) it is very cost and value competitive compared with Ford's offerings (Taurus and Contour). GM's relationship with the United Auto Workers is still strained: strikes over management attempts to outsource brake system calipers cost GM significant production losses in 1996.  40  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  T  ECHNOLOGY  T  he automobile is a highly engineered, sophisticated product that meets stringent reliability, durability, and social requirements. Its design, manufacture, and operation call more and more for cutting-edge technology. The Big 3 companies have a long history of aggressively pursuing research and development (R&D) to stay competitive, to meet the changing needs of the consumer, and to meet federal requirements. The diverse ways in which the companies meet these technology needs reflect their diverse corporate competitive strategies.  General Motors Research has historically emphasized internal corporate research and is currently the top corporate investor in R&D in the United States, with a 1995 R&D budget of $8.4 billion--a 19 percent increase over 1994. It also employs more PhDs than any other private employer in the United States. While much of its work has been in central research laboratories, GM is placing much greater stress on the integration of its research efforts with the product planning of its car and truck divisions. The GM tech center in Warren, Michigan, reflects this change. 4 The center's R&D plans are more focused on the needs of its operating divisions and its customers; more speculative R&D has been reduced. The center is now organized as a business unit, with its research portfolio fully open to GM's product development community. The center's director has set a goal of placing 50 percent of projects into production in two to three years. Consideration is also being given to licensing GM inventions throughout the industry. To meet its R&D needs, Ford relies on the Ford Research laboratory, which employs over 650 full-time scientists and engineers. In general, the objective of the research staff is to provide long-range technical leadership to the corporation worldwide. This means the lab is involved in a spectrum of activities ranging from the development of advanced product and manufacturing technologies to long-range, relevant research in key scientific and engineering disciplines. The research staff maintains a mix of long-, medium-, and short-range programs. Short-range efforts generally have a goal of solving immediate or pressing production problems and account for about 10 percent of Ford's efforts. Mediumrange projects are directed toward specific goals to meet longer-term company needs and generally make up about 80 percent of Ford's efforts. Long-range programs are the least goal-directed efforts and make up the remaining 10 percent. Ford's research expenditures of $6.5 billion in 1995 4  The automobile is a highly engineered, sophisticated product that meets stringent reliability, durability, and social requirements.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  41   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  made it the second largest U.S. corporate supporter of R&D, following GM. Chrysler Corporation addresses the need for new technologies differently. Chrysler research and development efforts are split into two portions. Its Scientific Lab handles technical R&D and delivers technical expertise and services to the rest of Chrysler's platform groups. The second portion of its R&D effort is primarily handled by a small group known as ""Liberty and Technical Affairs"" and relates to advanced development efforts. This group addresses specific high-technology projects and develops ideas in the form of concept cars and government contract proposals. The two R&D groups work in concert to monitor emerging technologies, pursue new product concepts, and develop platformfocused products.  This historic public/ private partnership aims to strengthen U.S. global competitiveness, preserve American jobs, reduce our country`s dependence on foreign oil, and improve the environment.  Cooperative Research and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles Complementing their individual efforts, the Big 3 automakers have also placed increasing emphasis on research collaborations with one another, with their suppliers, and with the federal government. For example in 1992, Chrysler, Ford, and GM created the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) to facilitate, monitor, and promote precompetitive cooperative research. Through this cooperative effort, resources are coordinated more effectively to conduct research and evaluate alternative technologies to improve the automobile. Besides working with each other to research and develop technologies for the next generation of vehicles, the Big 3 automakers are working with the federal government in a cooperative, precompetitive research effort called the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Combining the technology resources of seven federal agencies, twenty government laboratories, and USCAR, this historic public/private partnership aims to strengthen U.S. global competitiveness, preserve American jobs, reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil, and improve the environment. At an early stage of the partnership, the participants recognized the importance of involving the traditional base of automotive suppliers as well as some nontraditional sources of supply. Since that time, a special effort has been devoted to understanding the supplier community, recognizing its importance as a source of technical innovation, and 42 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  finding means for its effective interaction with PNGV. Currently, more than 400 automotive suppliers and universities have joined in PNGV research. PNGV has three mutually supportive, interactive goals: 1. Significantly improve national competitiveness in manufacturing. 2. Implement commercially viable innovations from ongoing research in conventional vehicles. 3. Develop environmentally friendly vehicles that can achieve up to three times the fuel efficiency of comparable 1994 family sedans (i.e., the 1994 Chrysler Concorde, Ford Taurus, and Chevrolet Lumina) without sacrificing performance, safety, or affordability. Major technical improvements and innovations are needed to enable the U.S. auto industry to build this next generation of automobiles, which will operate with much higher energy efficiencies and safety levels and lower emissions than today's vehicles, while maintaining present performance, size, and utility standards. (See table 3, which lists some of the technical areas USCAR has identified as needing research and development.)  Table 3.

In working together toward national social and economic goals, this partnership is a unique departure from traditional approaches to achieving public policy objectives.  Increasing Use of Electronic Components With both vehicles and transportation infrastructure incorporating more electronics into their systems, the auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronics components and as a driver of electronic technology development. Like many other industries, the automobile industry is rapidly increasing its use of electronic components. Virtually every aspect of driving a modern high-end automobile is controlled by electronics-- acceleration, braking, seating, security, entertainment, navigation, driver information, crash protection, steering, etc. This trend is likely to continue. In addition, the automotive infrastructure--traffic control and guides, law enforcement, toll assessment, and the like--rely increasingly on electronic controls. As a result of both of these trends, the auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronic components and systems and as a driver of electronic technology development. Ford and GM, which are highly vertically integrated with electronics, are likely to benefit as the market value of their electronics divisions grows.  The auto industry will likely grow as a consumer of electronic components and systems and as a driver of electronic technology development.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  45   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ADOPTION AND EVOLUTION OF LEAN PRODUCTION HUMAN RESOURCE PRACTICES Human Resource Management  Labor-management relations, workplace innovations, and human resource practices play a pivotal role in the economic performance and competitiveness of the American auto industry.  L  abor-management relations, workplace innovations, and human resource practices play a pivotal role in the economic performance and competitiveness of the American auto industry and serve as a bellwether and pacesetter for American industry in general. This has been the case from Henry Ford's moving manufacturing line and $5-a-day wage, to the ""quality of working life"" programs in the 1970s, to the present efforts to implement lean production models of work organization, human resource, and labor-management practices. These issues are tightly intertwined with technology and manufacturing strategies and practices. Indeed, the joint effects of these human and technical factors determine manufacturing performance.  Key Issues in Labor Relations Demographics in the United Auto Workers Automotive employment (particularly in the Big 3) has been hit by three important forces: (1) the industry has reduced its capacity; (2) the industry has improved its productivity, requiring fewer workers to make the vehicles demanded; and (3) global competition in the automotive supplier sector has resulted in a reduction in unionization. It has also resulted in a higher wage differential between employees of the Big 3 and employees of the supplier sector, who earn less. As a result, over the past two decades, the United Auto Workers (UAW) membership has declined and aged considerably. Few workers have been hired into UAW jobs in the past two decades and many low-seniority UAW members have lost their jobs. Moreover, a significant fraction of the UAW membership (estimated at 30 to 50 percent by some) will retire in the next decade. This is expected to lead to significant additional hiring and outsourcing by the Big 3.  46  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Labor-Management Innovations in the U.S. Auto Industry To preserve high-wage auto manufacturing jobs in the United States, many believe the auto industry must further the adoption of labormanagement cooperation and workplace innovation, such as the Saturn and New United Motors Manufacturing Inc. (NUMMI) models and Chrysler's Modern Operating Agreements. Despite 20 years of significant Japanese competition in the auto industry, the penetration of cooperative labor relations is still low in the U.S. auto industry. Why is diffusion of workplace innovations slower than expected in the U.S. auto industry? There is no consensus answer to this question. However, IMVP research, along with findings of a recent U.S. government commission,5 suggests that the following factors are significant: 1. Limits on labor/management teams. American labor law restricts the forms of employee participation in non-union relationships and places limits on employee participation and workplace reforms in collective bargaining relationships.6 Union recognition. Support and diffusion are also limited by business and labor battles over the process of union recognition. The ability and willingness of employers to open and maintain non-union facilities and the frustrations experienced by workers and union when trying to unionize facilities in the face of strong managerial resistance continue to strain labor-management relations. These tensions make it difficult for union leaders to be unwavering champions of cooperation and innovation in relations with management. The cooperative relations and trust required to sustain workplace innovations within and across companies are not likely unless there is a de-escalation of labormanagement conflict in new plants and new union organizations. The full benefits of these workplace innovations will not be realized until these larger conflicts are reduced. Economic pressures. Economic pressures for downsizing, outsourcing, cost controls, and short-term performance compete  2.

The diffusion of human resource innovations is constrained by the fact that these innovations have clear, immediate costs but uncertain long-term payoffs and by the relative unimportance of human resource policy in the strategic decision-making of American corporations.  Implications of the Key Issues in Manufacturing Plants and Human Resource Practices Changing Labor-Management Relations, Workplace Innovations, and Human Resource Practices Lean production is a composite of practices. For example, it links manufacturing policies with human resource/labor-management practices. The combination of these manufacturing and human resource practices produces the highest levels of manufacturing performance (quality, productivity, flexibility) in plants around the world.7 Plants that invest heavily in automation and advanced technologies without changing their human resource practices perform poorly relative to those that take an integrated approach to technology and human resources. By 1990, Japanese-owned plants in Japan and the United States had implemented more integrated human resource and manufacturing systems than U.S.-owned plants, which, in turn, had implemented more of these practices than European plants. In 1990, as today, there was wide variance in U.S. practices. Many plants were still characterized by traditional labor-management and human resource management systems. The unionized transplants, such as NUMMI, had gone far in implementing lean production and labormanagement systems jointly in a unionized environment. Some nonunion Japanese plants had also implemented many of these features. Saturn, a new GM division, had implemented a unique co-management system jointly with the UAW. From 1989 to 1994, U.S. plants continued to progress in adopting lean production practices and the associated labor-management and human resource practices. The latter practices have not moved as rapidly as in European plants, but the European plants had farther to go in achieving  The combination of these manufacturing and human resource practices produces the highest levels of manufacturing performance (quality, productivity, flexibility) in plants around the world.  7  James P. Womack, Daniel T.

The performance gap between Japanese-owned plants in Japan and in the United States and U.S.-owned plants has narrowed but remains significant. Finally, the variance of performance within regions is often as great or greater than the variance between regions. Specifically, the survey data suggest the following: 1. Inventory has been reduced considerably in U.S. and European plants and in Japanese North American transplants. In the United States, inventory reductions have been achieved more through reductions in supplier stocks than from internal plant buffers. U.S. plants have increased their use of teams, job rotation, and suggestion systems. However, the diffusion of these practices among Big 3 U.S. plants is proceeding at a much slower pace than in Europe. Japanese plants in Japan and in the United States continue to lead the world in the adoption of these human resource practices. There is modest increase in the diffusion of human resource practices such as contingent compensation, investment in training, and reduction in status differences in the United States, rapid growth in Europe (and in Australia), and continued use of these practices in Japanese plants in Japan and the United States.  2.  3.  U.S. plants have increased their use of teams, job rotation, and suggestion systems.  These overall trends mask considerable variation across companies and individual facilities in the United States. Ford, for example, has followed a cautious, steady incremental change process that has built on its experiences in joint ventures with Mazda (in the United States and abroad). It has made less use of teams than GM or Chrysler but focused more heavily on use of various total quality management tools and methods (e.g., statistical process control). Chrysler has a number of traditionally structured plants and a half dozen Modern Operating Agreement (MOA) plants in which the full range of lean production human resource practices are implemented for all workers through a joint union-management oversight and governance process. Chrysler also has several plants where many of these features are implemented without the full union-management governance process (Progressive Operating Agreement plants). Some case studies suggest that Chrysler MOA plants benefit significantly from this arrangement relative to its non-MOA plants.8  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  49   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  GM probably has the widest variation in experiences and practices. Considering the Saturn Corporation experiment and the NUMMI facility (owned jointly with Toyota), GM and the UAW have gone farthest among the Big 3 in experimenting with very different models of labor-management relations. Saturn, for example, has co-management structures and processes throughout the organization--from the shop floor to the strategic advisory committee that serves as Saturn's link to the GM parent, and across functional areas--from human resources to sales, marketing, and supplier relations. Yet GM also has many traditional plants and a large number of hybrid facilities that contain elements of both traditional and lean production manufacturing and work practices. Even given this wide variation, the U.S. auto industry is farther along than many industries in the United States in introducing and diffusing workplace innovations. In Saturn, NUMMI, Chrysler's MOA plants, and certain other facilities, the auto industry also has some of the most visible models of transformed union-management relations that serve as benchmarks for other industries. At the same time, the auto industry continues to have many rather traditional or only partially modified union-management relations and collective bargaining activities, as well as a growing non-union foreign transplant segment.  Overall, the United States has experienced a significant expansion in employee participation and associated workplace innovations over the past 20 years.  This diversity mirrors the diversity of practices and the mixed levels of support for workplace innovations among management and leaders throughout American industry. Overall, the United States has experienced a significant expansion in employee participation and associated workplace innovations over the past 20 years. In the past decade, the labor movement has become more willing to support these innovations and has recently endorsed the principles of workplace innovation and labor-management partnerships. Yet, despite the growing support for workplace innovations, our best estimates indicate that only one-fifth to one-third of American workplaces are engaged in significant employee participation or related forms of workplace innovation.9 Other Issues in Human Resource Practices In the mid-1980s, the UAW national leaders were advocates for new joint governance and more team-oriented approaches to plant relations. In the 1990s, however, they have been less committed to the approaches found 8  9  Malcolm Lovall, Susan Goldberg, Larry Hunter, Thomas A.

Thomas Kochan and Paul Osterman, (1994).  50  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  at NUMMI, Saturn, and other plants. This fact is best illustrated by the series of plant-level strikes at several GM plants over issues such as contracting out, staffing levels, production standards, and related local issues. Thus, the future rate of diffusion of these workplace innovations remains uncertain. Another important development in the U.S. auto industry in the 1980s and 1990s is the emergence of a significant and quite successful set of non-union transplant assembly plants. The only foreign-owned assembly plants that are unionized in the United States are joint ventures between GM, Chrysler, or Ford and a Japanese company. Toyota, Nissan, and Honda are operating their wholly-owned, non-union assembly plants in the United States. Toyota did so even after experiencing a high level of success in its NUMMI joint venture with GM and the UAW. Mercedes Benz and BMW are currently opening non-union assembly plants in the United States. Moreover, a large number of new foreign- and domestic-owned auto parts suppliers have opened plants in the United States in the past 15 years and kept them operating on a non-union basis. Thus, while the Big 3 (Saturn at GM, several renovated or newly opened plants at Chrysler, and selected Ford plants) have moved to governance systems that expand the role of the union, a significant portion of the industry is moving away from unionism altogether. This trend adds more diversity to the industry and a good deal of frustration and bitterness on the part of the UAW.  Moreover, a large number of new foreign- and domestic-owned auto parts suppliers have opened plants in the United States in the past 15 years and kept them operating on a non-union basis.  Experimentation Case Studies Twice in this century, the automotive industry has served as birthplace and proving grounds for fundamental innovations in the organization and execution of production. At the opening of the century, Henry Ford, the architect of the mass-production system, sifted through scores of ideas and performed thousands of experiments in the 20-year process of developing his system of production. Roughly a half century later, Taiichi Ohno, over a period of approximately 17 years (1948 to 1965), followed a similar path of constant experimentation, discovery, and innovation in developing the Toyota Production System. This tradition of constant experimentation in the search for improvements continues today in the auto industry--at the level of individual processes as well as at the level of the system of production.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  51   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Experimentation is the lifeblood of a healthy industry.  Such experimentation is the lifeblood of a healthy industry. Conversely, maintaining a stable system in a dynamic industry is almost a sure recipe for disaster. Few enterprises can expect shelter from Schumpeter's ""winds of creative destruction"" in today's world of increasingly open borders and tightly linked international economies. Organizations must experiment and grow to survive. Given this mandate for learning, most automotive companies today are actively exploring possibilities for improvement. In this section, we mention a few of the more visible experiments of the past decade. General Motors Seeks New Paths No company in the world mastered Henry Ford's system of mass production the way Ford's crosstown rival did. GM leapt ahead of Ford in the 1930s and raced to become the world's largest industrial concern. However, by the 1970s, as it sat on top of the world, GM had become frozen in the paradigm it mastered. The path to renewal has been slow and arduous. A number of GM plants have been very innovative in taking up the corporation's search for improvement in a world that has changed so dramatically since the early 1970s. Among these are the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, a joint venture between GM and Toyota; the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; GM Europe's Opel plant in Eisenach, Germany; and the CAM-I plant in Canada. NUMMI GM's manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, closed its doors in 1982 because of poor quality, low productivity, and dismal labor relations. Two years later, the plant re-opened as the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., under joint ownership of Toyota Motor Corporation and GM, using new management and labor policies but 80 percent of the UAW members who had worked there previously. IMVP researcher John Krafcik10 studied the before-and-after of the Fremont plant and discovered that, with Japanese lean methods, the new NUMMI plant doubled the productivity of the old plant, cut worker absenteeism by 90 percent, and cut the rework area in half with the installation of the ""pull cord"" system (in which workers on the assembly line pull the cord when a defect is detected, halting the system and allowing mass-produced errors to be eliminated). A low-tech operation, the NUMMI plant proved that a 10  John F. Krafcik, Learning from NUMMI (Cambridge, Mass.: IMVP and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1986).  52  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  plant did not have to be on Japanese soil with Japanese workers in order to be lean and successful. The plant demolished many myths about the nontransferability of lean production to the United States and to American workers. Saturn Also in the mid-1980s, GM's decision to create a ""different kind of a car company"" from the ground up resulted in the Saturn Corporation. The Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, provides a case study of a close labor-management partnership on the factory floor. Saturn has also created a unique partnership among the company, its dealers, and the car-buying public. Saturn leapt to the upper echelons of the closely watched J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys (recently rated third behind Lexus and Infiniti) and sets the standard for other dealerships on many dimensions. On the labor relations side, Saturn is a highly visible experiment with a new model of labor-management relations and organizational governance--one that challenges and departs from many of the customs, legal doctrines, and adversarial patterns of traditional U.S. industrial relations. Both the workers and the management at Saturn agreed from the start that they would distance themselves from the bureaucracies of GM and the UAW. It was an alliance between workers and management that has been pathbreaking in U.S. labor relations. The GM employee contract is seven inches thick, but Saturn's labor contract or ""Memo of Understanding"" is a scant 28 pages, covering everything including how the plant is managed. The agreement eliminated a number of sacred cows, such as the right to strike during the term of contract. Eisenach GM Europe's Opel plant at Eisenach is an example of a European enterprise embracing the principles of lean production.11 In 1989 the Eisenach plant, located in the then-moribund German Democratic Republic, was a morass of inefficiency producing an obsolete vehicle called the Trabant. GM purchased the Eisenach plant and brought in the best of lean expertise through the Kaizen Institute of Europe, a Japanese-based institute that teaches the values and methodology of lean enterprise. A new manufacturing plant was built in 199192, and intensive worker training introduced lean manufacturing methods. Problems were solved along the way, and lean principles were learned, built up, and implemented. The new plant is 11  With Japanese lean methods, the new NUMMI plant doubled the productivity of the old plant, cut worker absenteeism by 90 percent, and cut the rework area in half with the installation of the ""pull cord"" system.  Saturn has also created a unique partnership among the company, its dealers, and the car-buying public.  See discussion of Eisenach GM plant in Paul Ingrassia and Joseph B. White, Comeback: The Fall and Rise of the American Automobile Industry (New York, 1994).  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  53   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  already competitive with Japanese companies, is a vanguard plant for Opel and the rest of the European auto industry, and is on an upward curve of efficiency and quality. Toyota Tinkers with Success Toyota Motor Kyushu As the present decade opened, one of the biggest concerns among the major Japanese auto companies was that they would run out of labor to staff their factories in Japan, which seemed to face limitless demand for their automobiles. In 1993, two million Japanese 18-year-old males--the primary raw material for Japan's auto factories--entered the workforce. In 2010, only 1.2 million 18-year-old males will enter the workforce--a 40 percent drop. In 1990, just before Japan's ""bubble economy"" burst, the auto industry got a taste of what a labor shortage might be like. With much new found affluence and the growth of the financial and other service sectors, young Japanese began voting with their feet--against working in auto plants. The industry discovered that, despite the famed worker involvement through the kaizen process, car making, even in the highly touted lean production system, was, at its core, strenuous and unpleasant work. Some concluded that the greatest threat to the Japanese auto industry was the coming labor crunch. One solution to such a labor crunch would be to import more labor or cars into Japan to make up for any impending shortfall. (For example, Toyota has planned to import a small number of U.S.-made Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunbirds.) Another strategic option would be to reduce the labor content in automobiles through greater automation. A third would be to make automobile manufacturing jobs more attractive to Japanese citizens, competing more effectively on the labor market and shifting the labor shortfall to some other sector. The latter strategy is closely associated with the ""humanization"" movement, whose roots are primarily European. The movement was epitomized by the Uddevalla plant and its craft production environment with hours-long work cycles for many laborers rather than the repetitive 60-second cycle common in Japanese plants. Toyota attempted to address the anticipated labor shortfall using both greater automation and by making the jobs more labor-friendly. Toyota launched a new manufacturing company inside Japan--Toyota Motor Kyushu--and endowed it with new, automated, state-of-the-art, workerfriendly technology.12 Built at a cost of $1.5 billion and in continuous operation since 1992, the plant does stamping, body assembly, painting, and final assembly, in addition to making bumpers, instrument panels, 54 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  As the present decade opened, one of the biggest concerns among the major Japanese auto companies was that they would run out of labor to staff their factories in Japan.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  and suspension systems. Subsequently, due to an increase in the value of the yen and a stubbornly stagnant Japanese economy, the domestic labor shortage has turned to a surplus, perhaps reducing the strategic value of this plant. Toyota Motor Motomachi The Toyota Motomachi plant uses a different style of human resource practices in the assembly of the new four-wheel drive RAV4.13 Innovations include noise control, ergonomic interior design, and minimal use of robotics. The assembly line has a conventional overhead conveyor but is subdivided into five parts with buffer zones in between, relieving considerable stress on the workers. Automation has been cut back by two-thirds and is used only on rolling devices that move engines and gearboxes into position for human assembly. Toyota's rationale for reducing automation came from its own studies, which revealed that automation had reduced the number of line workers but had increased maintenance personnel. Producing 428 cars a day, the Motomachi plant may well have set a new benchmark for productivity, with a reported ten man-hours per vehicle. Though the success of the plant is attributable to Toyota management skills, some key ideas have been adopted from U.S. competitors, particularly Chrysler and Ford, which have also been reducing the number of parts in new models through value engineering techniques. Toyota plans to have each new model built with 70 percent of the parts common to earlier models. This plan has already saved Toyota nearly a half billion dollars. Supplier involvement in the design and engineering of full subassemblies has contributed considerable savings to Toyota, and more savings are expected in coming years. These examples, selected from two of the largest automobile companies, are but the tip of an enormous iceberg of experimentation in the industry. Every auto company in the world--large and small--is striving to find competitive advantage through innovations in products, technology, and systems management.  Toyota's rationale for reducing automation came from its own studies, which revealed that automation had reduced the number of line workers but had spawned a whole new generation of maintenance personnel.  12  13  C.H.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  55   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS S Supply Chain Policies  UPPLY  C  HAINS  T  he world's automotive manufacturing sector consists primarily of about 20 very large multinational corporations. The automotive supply sector, however, comprises thousands of firms ranging in size from a few employees to more than 100,000. Drawing conclusions about such a large and diverse sector is much more difficult than for the manufacturing sector.  Best practice in automotive supply chain management involves close, trusting relationships with long-standing suppliers that are intimately involved with the development and production of the components and subsystems they provide. The work of Kim Clark and Takahiro Fujimoto14 sheds much light on how outsourcing product development activities through ""black box parts"" reduces overall project lead time and engineering resources required for product development. In the past five years, Chrysler has aggressively incorporated those findings into its modus operandi, GM has largely rejected that philosophy, and Ford has settled somewhere in between. On the surface, the advice to improve partnerships along the supply chain, drawn largely from Japanese practices, seems to have significantly helped Chrysler on its return to growth and profitability. At the same time, GM insists on exerting extreme price pressure on its suppliers and aggressively negotiating division of the returns to innovations in supplied parts and subsystems. Some believe that this posture was responsible for the company's slow recovery from the recession of the early 1990s. However, GM estimates savings of $4 billion per year from this approach. GM is relying on its strong technical capabilities and its ability to bargain suppliers down on price to achieve its cost reductions. Chrysler, on the other hand, is encouraging its supplier-partners to find more ways to cut costs through cooperation and incentives to split gains.  Best practice in automotive supply chain management involves close, trusting relationships with longstanding suppliers that are intimately involved with development as well as production of the components and subsystems they provide.  14  Kim Clark and Takahiro Fujimoto, Product Development Performance (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 1991).

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  57   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  In Japan, the rise of the yen has driven significant amounts of automotive assembly off the islands, delivering a quadruple shock to the Japanese supply base. First, domestic demand for Japanese-made parts is declining due to the decline in domestically assembled vehicles. Second, Japanese manufacturing plants are looking offshore to import cheaper parts (and in some cases severing those long-term partnerships). Third, demand from non-Japanese manufacturing plants is declining due to the increasing cost disadvantage of Japanese domestically produced parts. Fourth, competitors of Japanese suppliers (in North America, for example) are growing stronger as they hone their lean production skills by supplying the growing demand for North American-made parts from the Japanese transplant production. Conversely, North American automotive suppliers are enjoying a quadruple bonanza thanks to the same four phenomena: (1) rising North American production volumes, (2) growing opportunities to export to Japan, (3) reduced competition from Japanese-based (yen-dominated) suppliers, and (4) increased rate of learning from Japanese transplant customers. For the near future, U.S. automotive suppliers should continue to reap gains as long as they continue to improve and the yen does not lose significant value against the dollar.  Key Issues in Supply Chain Relationships Arm's Length vs. Partnership in Supplier Relations We discuss here two kinds of supplier-assembler relations. The first is a short-term, arm's-length relationship with minimal flow of information between supplier and assembler. This type of contractual relationship has traditionally characterized most supplier-assembler relations in the massproduction system, particularly in the United States. One of the features of 1980s lean production is a relatively long-term relationship between assembler and supplier, characterized by a rich flow of information between the two. These partnership relationships, the second type of supplier relation, tend to continue indefinitely or carry the implicit promise of renewal at the end of a specified contract. The partnership relationship is exemplified in the Japanese-style multifirm organizations called keiretsu. When supplier responsibility for product development and investment is not an issue, the arm's-length relationship is often sufficient and partnership relations would be superfluous. Furthermore, while Japanese-style partnerships have economic benefits, they are costly to set up and maintain and may reduce a customer's ability to switch away from inefficient suppliers. But when the supplier's responsibility includes involvement in 58 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  One of the features of 1980s lean production is a relatively long-term relationship between assembler and supplier, characterized by a rich flow of information between the two.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  the development of new or altered parts, Japanese-style partnerships become increasingly advantageous to both parties and tend to result in superior performance all around. Partnering firms (1) share more information and are better at coordinating interdependent tasks; (2) invest in relation-specific site, human, and physical assets that lower inventories, improve quality, and speed product development; and (3) rely on trust to govern the relationship, which is a highly efficient governance mechanism that minimizes transaction costs for both parties. 15 The Challenge of Moving from Arm's Length to Partnership Assembler-supplier partnerships are important vehicles for speeding product development, sharing risks and resources, and accessing technology and knowledge.16 Though U.S. firms have moved toward adopting keiretsu-style partnerships, the process has often been slow due to entrenched attitudes and long-standing suspicion between suppliers and assemblers from decades of competitive bidding and short, arm's-length contracts. But there are deeper economic and social factors that increase the resistance to supplier-assembler partnering in the U.S. auto industry. The Japanese community-oriented culture inherently fosters more goodwill among firms than the American culture of ""rugged individualism"" and social heterogeneity. These cultural differences may explain why partnering between companies is taking time to become established in the United States. Many U.S. firms have now acknowledged that the Japanese system has a number of advantages over arm's-length relationships in automotive supply chains. Whether U.S. industry will widely embrace these practices or develop hybrids of Japanese and U.S. strategies to achieve tighter and more productive supplier-assembler relationships remains to be seen. However, the case of Chrysler, discussed later in this section, offers strong evidence that American firms can successfully and profitably implement the partnership model.  Many U.S. firms have now acknowledged that the Japanese system has a number of advantages over arm's-length relationships in automotive supply chains.  15  16  Susan Helper, ""Supplier Relations and Investment in Automation: Results of Survey Research in the U.S. Auto Industry,"" Sept. 1991; Sako, 1992; Dyer, forthcoming.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  59   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Slow Adoption of Innovative Human Resource Practices among U.S. Suppliers As with the adoption of partnership relations with customers, the record with respect to adoption of partnership with employees is mixed. On the positive side, 92 percent of supplier plants had quality circles, and on average, 56 percent of those firms' employees had attended a meeting in the six months before the survey was mailed in summer 1993. On the other hand, 38 percent of the plant managers who responded to the survey said they did not know (even within 10 percent) how many suggestions workers had made in the past year. Those who did know said half of the suggestions had been implemented on average.17 Slow Adoption of Innovative Practices with Second-Tier Suppliers Supplier relations with second-tier suppliers are sluggish and well behind the lean advances being made in supplier-assembler relations. Only about one-third of U.S. suppliers offer multiyear contracts or technical assistance to a majority of their own suppliers. Moreover, only 40 percent have a majority of suppliers who participate in product design or produce just-in-time.  Supply Chain Management Future Directions for Big 3 Supply Chains Only 29 percent of U.S. suppliers had relationships with their most important customer that could be classified as partnership relationships.18 GM has actively moved away from partnership relationships with its suppliers. The average length of contracts GM offers has fallen about 40 percent, from 1.8 years in 1989 to just over one year in 1993. GM also has set up a system of worldwide competitive bidding, saving an estimated $4 billion per year in the prices it paid for parts between 1992 and 1994. Despite the advantages to GM, some suppliers say they will refuse to supply new technology to GM due to its policy requiring quotes from prospective suppliers and complete technical information on the product and its manufacture, free of any claims of confidentiality.19 Such 17  18  Susan R.

Sloan Management Review, Spring 1995.  60  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  a one-way partnership relationship is unpalatable to some suppliers. GM officials acknowledge that this policy means that GM will have to continue doing most of its product development in-house in order to ensure apples-to-apples comparisons among supplier bids. This strategy could result in GM's losing the advantages of supplier participation in product development. On the other hand, the U.S. auto industry has made some significant strides toward partnership relationships since 1989, even taking into account the GM experience. For example, 80 percent of U.S. suppliers now provide their customers with detailed information on the steps they use in their production process--up from 50 percent in 1989. These new U.S. figures are equal to the percentages in Japan's supplier-assembler partnership relationships. The information suppliers provide is crucial to the adoption of techniques such as value analysis/value engineering, in which the production process is streamlined to eliminate waste. Similarly, the participation of U.S. suppliers in product design now matches the Japanese. U.S. suppliers now far outpace the Japanese in the percentage of the sales that come from products not produced five years ago: United States, 20 percent; Japan, 5 percent.20 Chrysler continues to devolve responsibility onto its suppliers. For example, TRW is working to integrate the passenger-side air bag into the instrument panel designed with another supplier, even though it means that TRW will no longer deal directly with the automaker on this product. However, most parts are still not provided in particularly large systems, meaning that the manufacturing plant must accommodate a great deal of complexity. The median supplier to the Big 3 assembles only four parts to make the component it supplies to the automaker; in contrast, the median Japanese-owned supplier to a Japanese assembler located in the United States assembles 12 parts.21 Several of the Japanese-owned assemblers (Honda and Toyota in particular) have established intensive technical assistance programs for their U.S.-based suppliers. For example, in Honda's BP program, a team including Honda technicians, supplier managers, and supplier workers studies one process for several months and makes suggestions to im-  On the other hand, the U.S. auto industry has made some significant strides toward partnership relationships since 1989.

This process has led to 30 to 40 percent improvements in quality and productivity in that area for each of the few dozen suppliers that have tried it.22  Chrysler Corporation has significantly restructured its outsourcing through a streamlined and geographically more accessible system of third-party logistics services.  Case Study: Chrysler's Supplier Logistics Chrysler Corporation has significantly restructured its outsourcing through a streamlined and geographically more accessible system of third-party logistics services.23 In all, Chrysler has considerably reduced the number of logistic providers. For example, the number of truckload suppliers has been reduced from 250 to 30, coordinated by only one lead truckload provider. The number of less-than-truckload suppliers has been reduced from 25 to just one. Chrysler has 2,600 suppliers shipping a total of 34,000 parts from 3,300 locations. The corporation has 38 facilities, three logistics centers, and 15 manufacturing plants. At both its Belvidere and Sterling Heights manufacturing plants, Chrysler has reduced the number of locations of supplier shipment points by around 40 percent and has significantly reduced the average distance from supplier point to manufacturing. Chrysler's plant in Bramalea, Ontario, offers an insight into creative utilization of existing facilities. Because it is manufacturing beyond its original capacity, the Bramalea plant is outsourcing more than most auto plants, integrating direct supplier sourcing (40 percent of volume) with flow-through warehousing (45 percent of volume) and a sequence center (15 percent of volume).

However, in the past several decades, the pressures on the industry to make its factories and product development processes more efficient have spilled over into the distribution and retailing (postmanufacturing) sectors--cutting profit margins and causing significant restructuring in the distribution and retail industry base. This restructuring, although quite significant, has attracted much less attention than the manufacturing sector's changes because it involves no dramatic dislocation of people, jobs, or economic base. These downstream segments of the supply chain are experiencing a shift from being capital intensive (focused on inventory investment) and people intensive (sales forces) to being more information intensive (having the right vehicle in the right place at the right time). Due to greater flexibility of labor and capital in the postmanufacturing markets, this conversion from physical logistics to information logistics is shifting the power and leverage in the supply chain toward economic agents that are highly entrepreneurial and flexible. These economic forces have reduced the number of dealers in the United States (now approximately 22,000) and are expected to continue doing so. More important than the absolute dealer count is the trend toward segmentation of the many industries that make up distribution. Preliminary research reveals early development of a number of new business structures and methods. Following are brief discussions of key trends emerging in this diverse industrial segment.  Due to greater flexibility of labor and capital in the postmanufacturing markets, this conversion from physical logistics to information logistics is shifting the power and leverage in the supply chain toward economic agents that are highly entrepreneurial and flexible.  Key Issues in Distribution, Retailing, and Postmanufacturing Unlike the small group of relatively tightly organized supply chains, the postmanufacturing sector is a much looser collection of organizations that are not so centrally focused around the automaker. Since most of these organizations are driven directly by customer behavior rather than assembly scheduling, their activities are constantly shifting and  24  This section is based on the research of Martin Anderson, Associate Director, IMVP.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  63   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  appear to be far more random than activities organized in the production portion of the value chain. Industrial performance in the postmanufacturing sector is determined by a set of loose linkages, constantly negotiated among a wide variety of independent companies, including automakers, parts suppliers, dealers, transportation companies, information services companies, advertising and marketing organizations, consumer groups, fleet owners, vehicle auctions, financial providers, and independent service and repair organizations. Since much of the control of this portion of the value chain occurs within the jurisdiction of state laws, local policy issues are often far more important at this end. If an automaker wants to improve its premanufacturing efficiency, it can focus suppliers on relatively homogenous performance measures throughout the linked production chain, such as manufacturing hours per vehicle or quality targets. If an automaker wants to improve its postmanufacturing inventory management, however, it faces a much more complex array of players and relatively few homogenous measures of performance. IMVP site interviews show that interdealer transfers (cars shipped between dealers to match local demand patterns) can range from as low as 5 percent to as high as 50 percent of sales within a single brand, depending on the dealer and the region. This finding indicates that both dealer and region can represent significant factors for profitable and efficient distribution.  A central issue is now emerging in automotive distribution--how to create incentives and commercial relationships among a number of players with different agendas in order to meet new competitive mandates for improved distribution performance.  Dealers within a single brand may create dramatically different positions with their customers. Some may adopt a Saturn-like ""no haggle"" posture; others may openly publicize the fact that they negotiate prices. There are high performers and low performers in all of these categories. Early research shows that diversity proliferates in this system that many have considered to be uniform. Thus, improving the distribution system will be quite different from improving the factories in the supply chain. Inventory control--a strategic pillar of distribution--requires orchestrating the behavior of car salespeople, dealer-owners, market data companies, transport companies, national and local advertising and promotion channels (television, radio, print, on-line), capital suppliers, and others. None of these players are owned by the automaker, and many are not contracted directly to the auto company. A central issue is now emerging in automotive distribution--how to create incentives and commercial relationships among a number of 64 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  players with different agendas in order to meet new competitive mandates for improved distribution performance. The principal U.S. auto industry challenges of the past 15 years were (1) to reduce the quantity of work required to make a car, (2) to reduce the defects in each car, (3) to reduce the resources required to develop a new car and bring it to market, and (4) to reduce the overhead of running the supply and manufacturing system. The massive response to these challenges has stemmed the growth rate in production costs by reducing waste in each factory and by better coordinating relations between factories in the supply chain. Now, at a time of growing global competition, the next challenge is to reduce wasted effort and cost in distribution. Given the relative diffusion of organizations in the postmanufacturing sector, this new challenge raises a number of related issues: n n  How to better capture and process customer requirements How to better link rapidly changing customer requirements to a comparatively less flexible production system How to better match specific vehicles to customer requirements How to speed delivery after the purchase agreement is concluded How factories and automotive manufacturing companies can best cope with rapidly diversifying types of retail and distribution channels How manufacturers might best relate to the growing number of multibrand retailers What major strategic changes will occur in the core franchise system, given the potential created by new information technologies The implications of global changes in postmanufacturing practices  n n n  n  n  n  Automotive marketing, distribution, and retailing represent approximately 20 to 30 percent of the value of a new car.

Almost one-third of this value is directly created by retailing of new and used vehicles, service and repair, and related postmanufacturing activity. Perhaps more important, many of the keys for a successful manufacturing company are held by players in the postmanufacturing sectors. Retailers, customer researchers, forecasters, distributors, financial sources, and others define what the manufacturing sector should make and how and when it should make it, because they have direct contact with the wishes of the ultimate customer. Manufacturing organizations that do not heed the information embedded in the complex postmanufacturing networks suffer poor sales, high inventories, and tarnished reputations with customers. In the past, with less competitive markets, auto companies could afford the often hidden costs of high retail inventories. Now, all manufacturers must find new ways to limit these costs by understanding customer needs and by listening carefully through the various layers of retailing and distribution.  Making Distribution Lean Factories are beginning to address the problems of sluggish auto distribution pipelines. Having learned the lessons of just-in-time inventory in manufacturing, virtually every car company is trying to extend such streamlining into the distribution and retail portion of the value chain. With tens of billions of dollars tied up in slow-moving inventory, the potential payoff has become clear. The challenge is to coordinate the diverse collection of organizations to collectively recapture some of that cost. The most common innovation is to change the structure of field inventory to more closely align the slower, less flexible factory manufacturing schedule with the rapid changes in customer demand, while simultaneously reducing total field inventory. Rover and other European companies have been innovative with various forms of stock pooling and order processing. Most American-based factories are launching similar efforts. Perhaps most widely publicized are the Cadillac experiments that pool all the Cadillac inventory in a region (e.g., Florida) for availability to any dealer in the region. The central thrust of these efforts is to allow individual vehicles to remain unclaimed until the ""sales moment,"" to allow them to ""float"" flexibly through the stocking system. Doing so can dramatically increase the likelihood that an individual vehicle will reach an exact match buyer. In the traditional system, production units are usually locked into a specific 66 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  delivery path before or shortly after manufacturing, and they queue up in field inventory or sell at a discount (or both) because they are not precisely matched to a specific buyer. Most observers expect major innovations in physical inventory distribution and the supporting information infrastructure during the next five years. Some companies clearly envision a form of ""produce to order"" in the car business within 10 years.  The Role of Information Technology in Selling Cars As in all of retailing, the information technology revolution portends dramatic change in the automotive industry. Electronic data systems provide the mechanism for much of the new and used car supply industry. Increasing information systems and controls have kept dealers in business as margins have become very thin. Major advances in technology will allow better matching of factory production and changing consumer tastes, resulting in leaner distribution patterns. The postmanufacturing businesses are beginning to show a huge appetite for new electronic services, and it is reasonable to expect that this growth will fuel corresponding growth in the computer and electronics sector. Given the potential of new information technology systems demonstrated by both the factories and advanced dealers, the auto retailing sector seems destined to become a significant electronic systems market during the next ten years. Information technology for the postmanufacturing business falls into the following categories: n n  Most observers expect major innovations in physical inventory distribution and the supporting information infrastructure during the next five years. Some companies clearly envision a form of ""produce to order"" in the car business within 10 years.  Technologies that enhance the existing business structure ""Spec-ing"" systems that allow salespeople to match factory options to customer needs more accurately and to create a more accurate demand forecast In-house training and service management systems that connect factory engineering expertise to all technicians in a within-brand dealership Customer outreach systems linked to factory-sponsored advertising and marketing Technologies that will accelerate current trends toward nontraditional distribution structures The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 67  n  n  n   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  n  Customer relation systems (via the Internet or similar customeroriented media) that allow brokers or order takers to become viable economic organizations (reducing significantly the role of traditional dealerships in many transactions) Analogs to shop-by-phone or catalog channels Retail systems that allow mega-dealers to solidify their multibrand positions (similar to the systems that support mega-retailers like Wal-Mart)  n n  Auto retailing can adopt many dimensions of the mail-order or direct-sell computer business.  An automobile is such a major purchase for most people that it will always require some form of physical retailing by dealers. However, auto retailing can adopt many dimensions of the mail-order or direct-sell computer business. A consumer information industry has already arisen in the auto sector over the past three decades. Now any customer can find the information needed to negotiate the purchase of a new or used car without visiting a dealer or using any factorysponsored information. This freedom allows customers to shop independently before going to a dealer. There are many more window-shoppers for cars than there are buyers, although these window-shoppers do represent future buyers. Increasing numbers of customers are window-shopping through information sources, many of which are being rapidly converted to the electronic media. Through on-line services, the Internet, toll-free numbers, and cable television, shoppers now have enhanced opportunities early in their decision cycle to find information and be guided to the choice of an appropriate vehicle, comfortably in advance of the time they actually make their purchase. In short, there are now many more ways to retail cars than setting up a street corner dealership, running television commercials, and hoping someone comes in to buy a car currently on the lot. Now buyers can be identified well in advance, and their shopping experience can be tailored to their personal buying style and timing. The implications are considerable for the rest of the automotive industry in terms of forecasting, production scheduling, inventory and financial control, and even product planning.  Independence and Diversification of North American Dealerships Much postmanufacturing activity, especially in North America, is not controlled by the automakers. Industry players in distribution and 68 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  retailing often act quite independently from the factory as they market automobiles. Moreover, distributors and retailers often work with more than one car manufacturer at the same time. Although dealerships carry factory brands, the dealer may not be as dependent on the factory as an automotive component supplier is; a distribution organization can potentially source its products globally--from any auto producer in the world. A unique, often confusing, characteristic of the retail sector in North America is the delicate balance of power between factory and dealer created by a network of state laws and the franchise contract. The dealer needs a franchise contract from the manufacturer to sell that manufacturer's cars. The manufacturer's control is not insignificant: Along with the franchise requirement, the factory can control the location and style of prospective dealerships. However, in most states the dealers enjoy protections from the factory. Moreover, the rise of mega-dealers is resulting in an increasing retail power over the factory. Estimates of the used car market vary significantly, but it is clearly much larger than the new vehicle market in terms of number of units sold per year. Because new car margins for dealers have become significantly lower than used car margins, used car sales often subsidize the new car sector. Service and repair are labor-intensive industries that create significant local employment. Used car auctions have become multibillion dollar industries and are responsible for building a national infrastructure of used car supply that rivals the supply power of new carmakers in many ways. Many dealers have emerged as major stand-alone businesses and are beginning to redefine the postmanufacturing markets. An increasing number of dealers have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion. Many more have annual revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars. These powerful corporations are responding to customers and are creating multibrand shops that cross over many factories. They can also negotiate for large blocks of high-quality used cars, which further insulates them from any one automaker. The best known example of this new type of mega-dealership is the growing and successful used car chain CarMax. Owned by Circuit City, the $6 billion publicly traded consumer electronic company, CarMax is a chain of no-haggle dealerships with inventories of about 1,000 top-of-theline used cars at each location. Circuit City uses inventory control and computer technology to control costs and to guide and inform customers about the products offered. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 69  Estimates of the used car market vary significantly, but it is clearly much larger than the new vehicle market in terms of number of units sold per year.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  There are five CarMax stores operating on the East Coast, with projections for 50 U.S. dealerships by the year 2000. Eventually CarMax and similar operations may be players in the new car business as well: Chrysler has already agreed to sell CarMax a new car dealership in the Atlanta area. Other dealers specialize in certain forms of retailing by selecting customer niches. For example, companies are emerging that specialize in leasing specific classes of autos such as sports cars. These retailers are counting less on volume and more on developing strong customer relations for repeat business. The most notable specialty segmentation is that represented by the Saturn Corporation. The foundation of Saturn's success is that its entire value chain, from raw material through used cars, is coordinated to provide a pleasurable buying and driving experience for its customers. While other companies and many retailers have instituted high customer satisfaction policies, no other company has yet completed such an extensive systemwide overhaul as Saturn. Other dealers are experimenting with selling by phone or catalog-style retailing. Some dealers associate with buying clubs (e.g., those formed by unions, employers, the American Automobile Association, or other groups) and thereby get access to ""pre-sold"" customers who do not want to spend much time shopping. One dealer takes telephone orders; another sets up shop on the Internet. The amount of electronic retailing has soared since mid-1994, and new technologies have made possible a whole new structure for the auto retailing industry.  The foundation of Saturn's success is that its entire value chain, from raw material through used cars, is coordinated to provide a pleasurable buying and driving experience for its customers.  One Example of Retail Innovation: The Saturn Corporation The Saturn Corporation has developed partnering relationships with its dealers, a lean concept previously untested by the Big 3. In less than three years, Saturn established itself as one of the strongest brands in the compact car segment while foreshadowing the revolution in automotive retailing in the United States. Saturn's distribution and retailing system has achieved high market share and customer satisfaction since its inception in 1985.25  25  J. Chris Koenders and Wujin Chu, ""A Case Study of Saturn's Distribution Strategy"" (paper presented at the IMVP Research Briefing Meeting, June 1993).  70  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Saturn's innovative marketing strategy began with the objective of taking market share away from Japanese imports in the United States. Saturn's market planning team examined retailing best practices in a number of companies, both automotive and nonautomotive. They saw a customerpull instead of dealer-push marketing strategy as the solution. To achieve customer satisfaction, Saturn fostered relatively few dealerships--fewer than 200 in 1993 (only 10 to 20 percent of the number of dealerships for other major manufacturers' divisions in the United States)--thereby encouraging high unit sales per store, with Saturn allowing the retailer to add satellite outlets as demand increased. Moreover, Saturn's partnerships with its retailers empower those companies to be involved in the decision-making councils of the Saturn Corporation. Saturn retailers have avoided the pitfalls of undesirable salespeople by hiring completely new personnel in a rigorous screening process. Low turnover in sales personnel has been indicative of the success of this method. By following a consistent pricing policy, Saturn dealers eliminate the stressful negotiating process in which customers can feel ""had"" by dealers. Customers are shown a sheet with a grid illustrating the retailer's price schedule according to model and options. Consistent pricing appears to withstand cyclical fluctuation between strong and weak demand periods. Saturn's distribution strategy allows the company to respond better to market fluctuations, mainly because it is in closer touch with the market. Fewer layers of management, along with information technology and the integration of retailers into the decision-making bodies of the corporation, ensure that feedback is immediate and appropriate action can be taken quickly. Saturn's distribution system has clearly been highly successful, but it must be adopted in full by the retailer in order to work; the components of this system are interrelated and have been constructed to function as a single coherent strategy. Its considerable competitive success is directly attributable to the unanimous embracing of these principles by Saturn and its retailers.  Saturn's partnerships with its retailers empower those companies to be involved in the decision-making councils of the Saturn Corporation.  Urban Multibrand Retailers Another form of retail innovation, multibrand retailers may be as important as the Saturn innovation, although less publicized to date. This type of innovation is sparked by individual car dealers that have become successful enough to gain independent financial resources. In some ways, multibrand dealers are the opposite of the Saturn apThe U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 71   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  proach. Saturn seeks to form a deeper partnership between a fairly narrow single brand and a dedicated body of single-brand dealers. The other form of innovation assumes that it is best to strengthen a multibrand position while obtaining a firm position with a large retail buying population. This is the most effective distribution and retailing model in almost all nonautomotive industries and might be considered the Wal-Mart or Circuit City approach. In this case, the innovative dealer organization will become highly responsive to the customer since a key to the business is a large and loyal customer population. This approach leads to many innovations such as roving demo cars driven to customers' work or homes, easy-order toll-free numbers, a wide variety of financial purchase or lease options, and a host of other customer-driven systems that vary by region and market style. On the supply side, this kind of organization will try to get the best vehicles from a large number of factories, just as Circuit City tries to get the best-selling televisions from a number of television manufacturers. This strategy involves setting up systems that help the factory (i.e., the dealer itself becomes a desirable customer) and matching the factory supply to customer demand by creating sophisticated forecasting and inventory management systems.  Conclusions The postmanufacturing sector of the auto industry has always been important but has received little attention from auto manufacturing executives. However, distribution has become so critical to overall strategy that the sector is receiving much more attention than ever before. The sector is extremely diverse and is not necessarily amenable to the same tight coordination that auto manufacturers are building into their premanufacturing supply chains. However, linking the distribution sector to the manufacturing sector is the key to attaining better responsiveness to customers and to achieving competitive advantage. Innovators like CarMax are introducing a totally different dimension-- strong independent companies that are not tied to any particular manufacturer and that have the muscle to negotiate attractive conditions with several manufacturers. The manufacturers will have to adapt to this new reality if they are to profit from the economies possible in the distribution system.  Linking the distribution sector to the manufacturing sector is the key to attaining better responsiveness to customers and to achieving competitive advantage.  72  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  REGULATION OF AUTOMOBILES SOCIAL OBJECTIVES  TO  MEET  Mobility, Economic Development, and the Automobile Mobility and Transportation Congestion  I  ncreased mobility and economic development have progressed in unison, and advances in transportation and associated infrastructure have been leading indicators of a nation's prosperity. The automobile, as a source of increased individual mobility, has been a particularly significant factor in bringing about economic growth and social change.  The automobile has reconfigured urban landscapes and influenced lifestyles in the United States and in other parts of the developed world. The United States and the other developed countries rely primarily on the automobile to provide personal mobility. Figure 14 shows the significant increase in auto travel in the United States, Europe, and Japan since the 1970s.26 Although the United States is considered the most autooriented society, Europe and Japan are now adopting the same orientation, and auto ownership is increasing at a faster rate in these areas than in the United States.  Figure 14. Per Capita Travel  Although the United States is considered the most auto-oriented society, Europe and Japan are now adopting the same orientation, and auto ownership is increasing at a faster rate in these areas than in the United States.  26  Lee Schipper and Maria Josefina Figueroa, ""People on the Move: A Comparison of Travel Patterns in OECD Countries,"" Draft, International Energy Studies, Energy Analysis Program, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, Calif. (1994).  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  73   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  A massive increase in automobile usage is also occurring in developing countries, where mobility is absolutely essential to the development process. As figure 15 shows, developed countries typically have 300 to 600 cars per 1,000 population, but many large developing countries have fewer than 10 cars per 1,000 population. While the market for automobiles in the developed countries will continue, the major growth will occur in the developing countries. However, a number of factors, including traffic congestion resulting from aging, overloaded roads, are reducing society's ability to maintain, let alone improve, mobility. Society's ability to address and resolve these concerns is critically important to the future of the automotive industry. Congestion has advanced from an urban concern to a regional concern that affects entire metropolitan areas. From 1982 to the present, the percentage of urban areas in the United States with major congestion problems increased from 22 percent to nearly 50 percent, and it is still increasing. According to an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey of 114 U.S. cities, congestion is severe to very severe in 33 percent and a worsening problem in 68 percent of the surveyed locations. Nor does it appear that public transportation systems can provide either an alternative to reliance on the auto or a means of resolving congestion. These systems provide mobility primarily to individuals without access to an automobile (typically the young, old, poor, and handicapped). Even the best systems in the United States cannot satisfy more than a relatively small fraction of mobility needs. In spite of large capital and operating subsidies, public transport's worldwide share of travel has not increased and is not likely to increase in the future. David Bayliss, chief planner for London Transport, has just completed a global assessment of public transportation systems. He concludes that, even if the current rate of growth of metros continues, this ""would barely keep up with the growth of urbanization and would mean that the metros' share of the rapidly expanding urban travel market would slowly fall.""27 The Information and Communications Revolution and Future Mobility Needs Information and communication technologies will greatly affect both the need to travel and the means of travel and may address transportation 27  David Bayliss, ""UITP Public Transport Panorama,"" Draft, London Transport Planning, June 1, 1995.  74  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Figure 15. Passenger Cars per 1,000 Population  Information and communication technologies will greatly affect both the need to travel and the means of travel and may address transportation congestion. congestion. These new technologies will enable the development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) in which the guideway (road), the driver, and the vehicle are integrated to enhance individual mobility and help to control congestion. Drivers will be able to request information on the best routes based on travel conditions. A visual display will give the driver navigation instructions. In addition, since the information system is aware of the status and location of all cars, various transportation system management strategies can be used to optimize the flow of vehicles. These strategies may include traffic light synchronization, ramp metering (and other forms of flow control), and electronic toll collection. The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 75   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ITS provides a framework to operate a dynamic, coordinated system of mobility services, responding to both consumer demands and social concerns. Most projects focus on the middle range of the capacity spectrum--improving areawide traffic flow, with potential improvements in capacity estimated to be 10 to 30 percent. At the high end of the spectrum are vehicle control strategies that significantly increase the vehicle capacity of roadways. These strategies include ""car following,"" which will reduce the space between cars, and ""lane control,"" which will allow more lanes to be used in a right of way. Vehicle control strategies can also improve safety through object detection and collision avoidance systems. At the low end of the spectrum are the control of roadway capacity through pricing or traffic rationing policies. The real-time control system allows these policies to be implemented on an as-needed basis. ITS may provide a foundation for a new vision of mobility for the 21st century. However, implementation of an ITS strategy will be most effective if it can be coordinated nationally and internationally. With numerous technology choices and significant new market opportunities, extensive entrepreneurial activity and experimentation will motivate the innovation process. At the same time, the public sector has a significant stake in these systems, both as the owner of the roadways and as the potential operator of resulting traffic management systems. Furthermore, the need for system compatibility extends across national borders, making some international coordination necessary. ITS represents an interesting market opportunity for automotive companies. BMW, Daimler-Benz, and Volkswagen have teamed with Bosch and several other firms to implement ITS in German cities. General Motors has been an active participant in several ITS projects in the United States. As these examples suggest, ITS may provide automobile manufacturers an opportunity to expand their business to include providing broader mobility services.  Safety Concerns and the Automobile The level of safety achieved by today's vehicles far exceeds what was available several decades ago. While government regulation has played an important role, changes in consumer preferences and in public attitudes have also been important factors. The cumulative impact of government regulations requiring seat belts, padding, reinforcements, and a myriad of other features has made vehicles much safer in the event of a  76  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  crash. In addition, our transportation infrastructure, particularly the interstate system, incorporates more safety features. Auto safety has also improved as a result of consumer demand for safety features that go beyond current regulations, such as air bags and antilock braking. In other words, safety sells--even though safety regulations have added about $1,000 to the average selling price of passenger cars since 1980. Finally, society's attitudes toward intoxicated drivers, a major cause of traffic accidents, have hardened quite dramatically over the past few decades; a drunk driver is more likely to be viewed today as a callous criminal than a wayward reveler.  Auto safety has also improved as a result of consumer demand for safety features that go beyond current regulations, such as air bags and antilock braking.  Environmental Concerns and the Automobile In many ways, the automobile epitomizes the environmental challenge of today. It is a large consumer of a critical and limited fossil energy resource; in many countries it is the largest contributor to man-made greenhouse gas emissions and brings large amounts of lead into contact with people; it is the prime cause of urban smog; it is noisy and contributes to congested cities; and its manufacture produces an array of emissions, including those from the mining and production of steel and the painting of auto bodies. In spite of great strides in the technical performance of individual vehicles, many problems remain. The environmental challenges the automobile industry faces today are radically different from those it has confronted over the past three decades. These differences arise from major changes in their technological, economic, and political context, and their resolution will require a serious reexamination of the corporate and governmental institutions with which the automobile industry must interact. Automobile Technology and Environmental Initiatives Automobile technology has followed a trajectory of ever-increasing utility and complexity, both in general and with regard to the environment. Today's automobiles are vastly cleaner, more efficient, and less harmful to the environment than their 1970s counterparts.28 A whole series of environmental issues (such as the automobile recycling crisis of the 1960s; the need to reduce airborne emissions of lead, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides; the need to increase fuel economy; and more recently the global banning of chlorofluorocarbons) have 28  Today's automobiles are vastly cleaner, more efficient, and less harmful to the environment than their 1970s counterparts.  See Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association Auto Industry Statistics.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  77   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  been largely resolved through technologies that enable automakers to provide an economical product with equivalent (if not better) performance while meeting environmental objectives. Today the industry faces environmental challenges that raise complex and controversial issues and which can best be resolved with the full involvement of both government and industry. Today, the industry faces environment challenges that raise complex and controversial issues and that can best be resolved with full involvement of both government and industry. Zero-emission vehicle Although there is no such thing as a zero-emission vehicle (pollution will be created somewhere by the construction, use, and disposal of the vehicle), a number of initiatives bear this rubric. Spurred by the California clean air standards, the zero-emission car initiatives exemplify technology-forcing regulation. In spite of researchers' best efforts, electric battery technology critically limits even the most advanced electric car to roughly 100 miles between charges. With advanced battery technologies still years away from production, automakers must rely on lead-acid batteries, with the concomitant introduction of more lead, rather than less, into the automobile materials cycle. Furthermore, the influence of such vehicles on net air quality is increasingly in question, particularly in light of the continuing, documented air quality improvements arising from the replacement of old vehicles with newer ones. Weight reduction Reducing the weight of the automobile has been a design strategy since the onset of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, both by reducing vehicle size and by reducing weight through material substitution. However, material substitution is not a simple process. Changes in materials require changes in manufacturing technology, which is constrained by the economics of large-volume production. Henry Ford's assembly line would have been infeasible had he chosen to employ the traditional automobile material of his era, wood. It was his choice of steel, which could be formed and joined in seconds, that made his assembly line feasible and cost-effective. Today, considerable efforts are aimed at finding ways to process lightweight materials within the current automaker production line target of 75 vehicles per hour. Many advanced materials are available and are used in applications ranging from sporting goods to advanced aerospace vehicles. However, none of them are fabricated in ways even remotely compatible with the rates of automobile manufacture.  78  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Vehicle recycling Recycling in the United States is entirely a private industry undertaking, composed of a large and profitable infrastructure of dismantlers, shredders, and nonferrous metal processors supplying used parts and secondary metals. Recycling has emerged as an environmental issue for the automobile over the past five years, primarily in response to European initiatives, but it is actually a relatively old issue--one that has already been resolved once. For cars that are recycled (90 percent of the total manufactured), roughly 75 percent of the vehicle's mass is recovered and reused. But this means that 32.5 percent of all material that goes into automobiles in the United States is not recovered (most of it becomes landfill). Today's automobile recycling research is focused on the unrecycled content of the vehicle, particularly its polymeric content. An adjunct issue is the remaining 10 percent of cars that are not recycled at all. Automobile plastics are currently employed to improve vehicle safety (in interiors) and to reduce vehicle weight to save fuel and reduce emissions. These crucial materials largely become landfill because of the complexity of the plastic blends and the difficulty of recovering them through recycling. However, some analysis suggests that the benefits of reductions in weight and fuel consumption of composites, even if not recycled, may outweigh the costs of lower recycling rates. These environmental initiatives illustrate the key technological problem facing the automobile industry today. In each case, there are critical tensions among the technologies available to meet the initiative, the cost of their implementation, and their impact both on traditional measures of vehicle performance and on these newer indicators of performance. For example, if cars are to be largely composed of polymer composites, how are they going to be recycled? If the zero-emission vehicle is going to use batteries, how are the toxic heavy metals usually associated with batteries kept out of the environment? And how is vehicle safety maintained, when the vehicle's mass is reduced by 50 percent? Is the reduction of landfill consumption through increased recycling worth the net increase in energy used to run recyclable vehicles?  For cars that are recycled (90 percent of the total manufactured), roughly 75 percent of the vehicle's mass is recovered and reused.  Diverse Approaches to the Regulation of Auto Manufacture and Use As the preceding discussion indicates, increased mobility, via the automobile, has caused serious social concerns--allocation of scarce land The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry 79   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  resources for transportation infrastructure, depletion of finite energy resources, and detrimental environmental and safety impacts. Governments have responded to these concerns in many different ways. They have limited new roadway construction, invested in public transport systems, attempted through transportation system management practices to squeeze more out of the existing infrastructure, implemented vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and, in some cases, introduced auto use disincentives, such as increased fuel taxes, auto-free zones, and road pricing. A few metropolitan areas have considered more draconian measures such as limited bans on driving if severe pollution conditions develop. The approach to regulation of the automobile varies significantly by country, reflecting different social priorities. Vehicle recycling is a high priority in Germany but of far less concern in the United States. Noise pollution from automobiles is a higher priority in Europe than in the United States. On the other hand, urban air pollution is a higher priority in the United States, particularly in areas such as Los Angeles, than in other countries. One example of the diversity of approaches is the use of gasoline taxes as a means of controlling auto use. The price of gasoline is $3 to $5 per gallon everywhere in the world except the United States, where the price is $1 to $1.50 per gallon. The United States has relied on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations aimed at automobile manufacturers to improve fuel economy rather than on an increased gasoline tax focused primarily on drivers. U.S. auto regulations tend to focus on new cars to achieve social objectives. An example is urban air pollution. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of the vehicles are producing 75 percent of the pollution. Removal of these ""clunkers"" is far more cost-effective than additional regulations on new cars. There are several ways to remove old vehicles. France and Spain have used vehicle buyback programs giving credits for trading in clunkers, and private industry has implemented ""cash for clunkers."" Devices to detect the highest polluting vehicles could also be used on the roadway instead of, or to supplement, vehicle inspection programs. The differences in national approaches to regulation lead to a serious design problem for the manufacturers, which are under increasing competitive pressure to make their products for international markets. Conflicting national and regional regulations discourage such global 80 The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  The United States has relied on the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations aimed at automobile manufacturers to improve fuel economy rather than on an increased gasoline tax focused primarily on drivers.   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  approaches and may inhibit the competitiveness of the manufacturers. Indeed, national regulatory requirements might be used not to achieve social objectives but as a trade barrier to favor local manufacturers. Harmonization of international regulatory approaches and standards will help auto manufacturers adapt to globalization of markets. Furthermore, the regulatory process would be improved by requiring the consideration of interrelated social objectives, since regulatory actions to achieve one social objective, such as reducing air pollution, might have adverse effects on other social objectives. Finally, there are alternatives to the command-and-control regulatory approach embedded in many U.S. regulations. The creation of publicprivate research collaborations in the PNGV project reflects a novel approach to the technological challenge of controlling the environmental impact of the automobile. Market-driven strategies such as road pricing and emissions trading are also gaining more support. Company-based initiatives to improve the product and production process are also attractive alternatives to government-imposed regulations.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  81   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS  T Supply chains are long and complex, and there are many important players both upstream and downstream of the major manufacturers.  his study synthesizes our understanding of a complex global industry. It seeks to identify important trends,29 competitiveness issues, and topics relevant to public policy. The most important points are these: 1. The automotive business is played out on a worldwide stage. Supply chains are long and complex, and there are many important players both upstream and downstream of the major manufacturers. Furthermore, long supply chains exist within the major manufacturers as well. Consequently, competition can be thought of as occurring between supply chains (e.g., Nissan's vs. Ford's), with the added complexity that these chains may share common elements (e.g., component suppliers, dealerships, or even jointly developed products). Competition may also occur within supply chains (e.g., a manufacturer and component supplier each may want to add significant and unique value to the vehicle's electronics capabilities). Speed and flexibility (agility) in detecting shifts in market opportunities and reconfiguring the supply chains to respond to the opportunities will be the important rent-earning assets. 2. Although private sector companies dominate many aspects of the industry in the developed world, governments have historically played, and will likely continue to play, major roles in shaping the industry. The U.S. government has significantly influenced the emissions, economy, and safety features of cars. The government of China will likely decide which companies will be allowed to participate in the development of China's automotive industry as well as the rules of that development. 3. Although the auto industry is often referred to as ""mature,"" dramatic changes in product and market leadership, technology, distribution channels, and even the geography of production have occurred in the past two decades. 4. Sales volume is likely to continue its exponential growth in developing countries, and comparatively flat demand will continue in the developed world. As a result, much of the new  29  Industrial history is littered with predictions that look foolish in hindsight. Therefore, some of the projections based on current trends are bound to be wrong.  82  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  investment and perhaps many product innovations will occur in the developing world. Therefore, production volumes, real wages, and working conditions are likely to improve significantly in the developing world. Developing countries such as Korea hope to become significant exporters, above and beyond satisfying their burgeoning domestic markets. 5. Severe competition is likely in every segment of the supply chain, driving innovation in business models and causing continued turbulence in the standings of different players. Global sourcing is not likely to disappear; however, it will be tested as to when it is optimal for the entire manufacturing-todelivery process. In some cases, tight links with longtime partners may give better overall performance than use of lowest cost global suppliers. 6. Especially in the developed world, public sector pressures to make vehicles safer and more environment-friendly are unlikely to abate. These pressures will drive research and innovation in powertrains, fuels, electric vehicles, and lightweight materials. Given the twin pressures of government regulation and product competition, car companies that can develop and implement innovations in their supply chains are likely to benefit significantly in finding low-cost ways to meet requirements and put customer-desired features on the vehicles. 7. Cost competition will continue to encourage World Car concepts that amortize development efforts over more production units. Government regulations that are not harmonized across borders will continue to limit (at least to some degree) the attainable gains from this strategy, giving companies ample reason to lobby for improved regulatory coordination. 8. Predicting industry concentration trends is very difficult. For every argument for consolidation, there is another to support the contention that new competitors will surface. The economics of development and manufacturing support concentration, but the splintering of the distribution chain, the geographic dispersion of market demand, and the possible radical shifts in technology (e.g., nonferrous electric vehicles) may encourage disaggregation.  Especially in the developed world, public sector pressures to make vehicles even safer and more environment friendly are unlikely to abate. These pressures will drive research and innovation in powertrains, fuels, electric vehicles, and lightweight materials.  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  83   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  9. The industry will continue as a knowledge-intensive industry, as opposed to just cutting, forming, and joining metal. Consequently, intellectual asset development--in manufacturing, marketing, engineering, etc.--will increase as a key competence for all firms. Strategies that jettison intellectual capital in response to cost pressures are likely to lead to ruin in the longer term. Firms should continue to experience significant returns on improved human relations throughout the organization and into the supply chain. 10. As in many other industries, electronics will continue its inexorable march into the product. Designers have myriad ideas for increased electronic control of the vehicle, and consumers seem to like such features. The continued shrinkage in cost and size of electronic components also makes them attractive. More broadly, the use of electronics will increase for control of the entire transit system, as well as on board the vehicle. These trends are likely to shift more economic power to the suppliers and integrators of automotive electronics technology. 11. Finally, we expect that the automotive industry will continue to be thought of around the world as ""the industry of industries,"" due not only to its sheer size in the economy of nations, but also to the high-dimensional complexity it exhibits. On so many dimensions--product complexity in design and manufacture, number of product attributes important to customers, process technology variety, supply chain size and complexity, rate of globalization, intensity of government involvement, complexity of labor relations, and impact on the landscape of human lives-- the automobile industry presents a scope of management challenges whose complexity dwarfs that of most other industries.  84  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  APPENDIX A: THE U.S. SUPPLIER BASE A CASE EXAMPLE OF GLOBALIZATION30  AND  M  EXICO:  or decades, the auto industry in the United States was concentrated near the Great Lakes. In 1975, half of all U.S. auto production (both parts and assembly) occurred in just 16 of over 3,000 U.S. counties. By 1990, however, these 16 counties accounted for only one-third of a similar level of automotive employment.31 A significant amount of automotive employment has moved out of the United States entirely: As of 1994, the top 15 U.S.-owned suppliers to North American manufacturing plants employed 130,000 people in Mexico.32 Much more employment has moved a shorter distance--to the Japanese transplant cluster just south of the Great Lakes region. However, this trend has positive aspects. For example, suppliers located outside the old geographical ""agglomeration"" tend to have more partnership-like relations with their manufacturer customers: The suppliers are significantly more likely to trust their customers and treat them fairly and also more likely to provide their customers with information about their process steps. Negative aspects of this geographical shift include farther travel for parts, which reduces the ability to implement JIT and causes more traffic congestion. It has also meant a drop in employment in the areas where the supply industry was once dominant. While overall employment in the auto supply sector (SICs 3714 and 3465) remained relatively constant between 1975 and 1990, Wayne County, Michigan, lost 18,000 jobs in this sector over the same 15 years--more than one-third of its total 1975 employment level.33 Despite the growth in employment in Mexico, the Mexican supply sector has a long way to go to be world-class. Mexican-owned suppliers, which are typically small shops (maquilas) without sophisticated quality assurance or product development techniques, find it difficult to attain cost and technology advantages over competing foreign suppli-  F  Suppliers located outside the old geographical ""agglomeration"" tend to have more partnershiplike relations with their manufacturer customers.  30  31 32 33  See Kaye Husbands, ""The Competitive Advantage of the Mexican Auto Parts Industry: Past Strategies, Current Capabilities, Future Outcomes,"" Draft Proposal, Williams College, Williamstown, Mass., 1995.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  85   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  ers. Only a few large Mexican automotive suppliers that are associated with an industrial group or that are engaged in a successful strategic alliance with a foreign firm are likely to be competitive in price, quality, delivery, and service. Some of the reasons for this problem follow. n  Smaller scale of production in Mexico. Mexican parts plant managers and corporate executives report that their input costs are often significantly higher than those of their foreign competitors and that it is difficult to create low-cost products because of lower production volumes in their plants compared with foreign plants. Inefficient use of labor. Though manufacturing techniques of Mexican suppliers take advantage of relatively lower labor costs by using relatively more labor-intensive processes than their U.S. competitors, the employee turnover rate is much higher in Mexico (six times that in the United States). Training costs and missed learning curve economies therefore elevate the cost of operation. Incomplete integration of statistical process control (SPC). SPC is not prevalent among Mexican suppliers, and many of the firms that use SPC have not used it to adjust their production processes. For example, many companies claiming to have JIT in fact have significant stores of material or have shipping bottlenecks. Absence of CAD/CAM. Most Mexican suppliers get involved in the middle of the product development process or even later, partly because of the lack of CAD/CAM systems, other product development tools, integrated information commerce, or the human capital necessary to contribute to the product development and engineering processes.  n  n  n  86  The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  Human Resource Management Issues  34  Though Mexico is often considered a prime location of low-cost auto production in North America due to low Mexican wages, recent evidence based on a simulation study suggests otherwise.35 Because of the low wages (about $2 per hour before peso devaluation, including fringe benefits in maquiladoras), low education (typically sixth grade), and high turnover (90 to 100 percent), it is difficult to implement lean production policies such as quality circles and worker suggestion systems that produce continuous improvement.36  Though Mexico is often considered a prime location of low-cost auto production in North America due to low Mexican wages, recent evidence based on a simulation study suggests otherwise.  Supplier Issues The use of Mexican suppliers depends not only on their capabilities but also on their strategic fit in the auto manufacturer's global supplier network. The head of supplier management at a U.S. manufacturer in Mexico indicated that 97 percent of its Mexican suppliers are certified at the basic level, but none of those suppliers is likely to receive full-service supplier status; once the company has one or two traditional suppliers that can design a given product it is not necessary to certify yet another supplier at that level. Only Mexican suppliers that have already earned world-class status and that can compete with foreign suppliers on price, quality, and deliverability will be part of the global supplier network at the first tier. Of these suppliers, few, if any, will gain status as full-service systems integrators. The other suppliers that remain in business will most likely become second- or third-tier suppliers to OEMs or producers for the aftermarket.  34 35 36  Husbands, ""Competitive Advantage."" Ibid.

The U.S. Automobile Manufacturing Industry  87   OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY  APPENDIX B: REGULATORY POLICY HARMONIZATION  AND  T  he type and meaning of regulations affecting the automobile industry vary widely from one region or country to another. For regulatory control to produce maximal benefits, there should be interregional agreement on the standards and metrics of regulation (or at the very least a method of translating the metrics of one regulatory system to another).  Firms with assets devoted to multinational business such as the world auto industry will benefit from regulatory harmonization that maximizes the use of their assets.37 They will oppose divergent regulations that inhibit effective use of assets. On the other hand, firms with investments specific to a given domestic market may fight regulatory convergence, which threatens their investment by making entry easier for outsiders and will support heterogeneous regulations. Firms with investments featuring low ""asset specificity"" (i.e., those assets that are mobile or have valuable alternative uses) may relocate to less restrictive regulatory environments. Such movements facilitate heterogeneous regulations in what might be termed a ""competition in laxity"" among regulating regions. Dominant, established firms in concentrated markets are well positioned to shape regulatory environments to their advantage. With higher market shares, they can capture a larger proportion of regulatory benefits. Because of their size and wealth, they may have greater resources to achieve their regulatory goals through lobbying, funding, research, public relations, and differential absorption of regulatory costs. Dominant producers in highly concentrated industries or markets are likely to fight for regulations that provide (1) direct monetary subsidies, (2) constraints or subsidies on substitutes or complements of commodities produced, (3) price fixing, and (4) control over entry by new rivals. Environmental justifications for regulation may foster profits by legitimating principles for regulation and by adding environmentalists to regulatory coalitions.  For regulatory control to produce maximal benefits, there should be interregional agreement on the standards and metrics of regulation (or at the very least a method of translating the metrics of one regulatory system to another).  37  Oye and Maxwell, 1994.

We have an action-packed week planned for the Seventh National Clean Cities Conference in Philadelphia, especially designed for all Clean Cities coalitions and industry stakeholders. This year's conference will feature discussions and ""car talks"" on a variety of alternative fuel subjects, as well as a few new activities that are certain to  create plenty of excitement. Highlights include ""The Great Diesel Debate"" and inspirational thoughts from motivational speaker and comic/impressionist, Terry Braverman. Also, media personality Bill Nye will host the children's ScienceFest, a celebration of alternative transportation innovations for our next generation car buyer.   Our AFV Expo promises the biggest and best to date. And, thanks to our conference sponsors, we all can experience the spirit of Philadelphia with activities such as the Mummers Strut Lunch Munch, Invention Convention at the Franklin Institute of Science, Franklin Feast, and-for the early risers-a ""Streets"" of Philadelphia run/walk. Or you can sway to the sounds of the Philadelphia Boys Choir, tap your toes to the Legends of Jazz, or dance the night away and enjoy the city's skyline at ""The Eighth Floor Reception."" For more details about the conference, check out our Web site,  www.ccities.doe.gov/conference.shtml .   At the conference, we will highlight progress made toward achieving our goals-goals to increase the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), the amount of alternative fuel used, and the number of strong, self-sustaining Clean Cities coalitions. We announced these goals at the first Clean Cities Washington Day meeting held in March 2000. This March at Washington Day 2001, we unveiled new strategic approaches and offered new tools to help coalitions reach those goals. You can learn more about the new Clean Cities strategic plan and Washington Day 2001 in our cover story.                Also featured in this issue is an article about heavy-duty truck cab comfort units, or ""anti-idling devices."" These small, auxiliary power units provide truck operators with a cost-effective, efficient way to heat and cool their cabs-without running the engine, wasting fuel, and emitting additional pollutants. For more on ways to ""discourage idle behavior"", please see our feature on page 7.                Best wishes, and as usual, enjoy the issue.

Cover Story     C lean Cities Maps Its Strategy for a Decade of Success     T he Clean Cities' vision of the future is one of strong, vibrant, self-sustaining coalitions and niche markets in which alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleets operate 100% of the time on alternative fuel. It's a vision that includes 1 million AFVs on the road, using 1 billion gasoline gallon equivalents of alternative fuel. It is also a vision that could become reality. At Clean Cities Washington Day 2001, program staff and industry partners unveiled the specific strategies designed to help local coalitions build a viable national alternative fuels market.    The strategies presented at Washington Day 2001 are a result of stakeholder input at the first-ever Clean Cities Washington Day, held on March 15, 2000. At that meeting, Clean Cities Program staff announced three new long-term goals, designed to advance the most fundamental purpose behind Clean Cities-to promote AFVs and increase alternative fuel use:     1 million AFVs on the road (using alternative fuel) by 2010,  1 billion gallons of alternative fuel used in AFVs annually by 2010,  75% of Clean Cities coalitions self-sustaining by 2005.   To reach these goals, each Clean Cities coalition must increase AFVs in its region by 17 percent annually, with an average fuel consumption rate per vehicle of 850 gasoline-gallon equivalents (gge). It's an ambitious goal, but coalitions have a variety of new tools, services, and behind-the-scenes support mechanisms to help.    Washington Day 2001 provided a forum for Clean Cities staff and industry partners to discuss strategies to achieve the three Clean Cities goals, as well as future plans. The strategies are grouped into five main program areas:     Strong existing coalitions,  Self-sustaining niche markets,  Increased funding for AFV and infrastructure projects,  Legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development,  Mandates and/or alternatives to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).   Of the five program areas, the first two offer greatest opportunities for influence by the Clean Cities Program. Success in the other three depends largely on legislative action, policy, and the hard work of Clean Cities' industry partners (see box, page 5). At Washington Day 2001, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey unveiled the program's new strategic plan, which outlines DOE's efforts to help strengthen coalitions and build self-sustaining niche markets.      Stronger Coalitions  The desire for strong existing coalitions clearly extends from the Clean Cities goal to see 75% of coalitions ""self-sustaining by 2005."" According to the Clean Cities plan, one key to coalition strength is effective leadership from its coordinator. The coordinator is a person who is usually asked to wear many hats. Various roles can include facilitator, marketer, motivator, grant writer, organizer, researcher, liaison, mediator, public affairs specialist, manager, and fundraiser. Those responsibilities are difficult enough for any full-time person, but especially for a coordinator who works only part-time. Of the 80 Clean Cities coalitions nationwide, only about 15 percent have full-time coordinators.    Another source of strength is a diverse base of stakeholders. Coalitions should seek the active involvement of fuel providers, local and state governments, private fleet operators, and auto dealers. Other potential participants might be metropolitan planning organizations, large corporations, public relations firms, nonprofit organizations, airport management, universities, and local fire departments.     A thriving board of directors, composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds beyond alternative fuels, can make an enormous difference in building a sustainable coalition. Board members often donate money, actively promote the organization, and solicit funds on its behalf. Strong boards have members who tend to stay longer than one term and provide organizational continuity. They take an active part in setting goals and objectives and evaluating coalition progress.    Clean Cities will offer new training workshops to educate state and local policymakers and incorporate as a non-profit organization. Additional strategies under the ""strong existing coalitions"" heading include building fleet customer prospects, developing markets for alternative fuels, grant writing, and using existing outreach services such as the Clean Cities Hotline. All are described in the plan. The Clean Cities Program will offer training workshops in some of these areas in all six DOE regions, in 2001-02.      Filling a Niche  Niche market fleets, which often travel contained routes and are fueled at a central location, offer an enormous opportunity for alternative fuels. And high-mileage fleets can benefit from considerable cost savings using alternative fuel. Clean Cities coalitions have already identified several potentially successful niche markets, including airports, transit agencies, cargo and delivery companies, and government fleets. Although a wide variety of vehicle types can comprise a single niche, those vehicles can share an infrastructure, which helps ensure the success and longevity of the market.    In the Clean Cities strategic plan, the term ""self-sustaining niche markets"" implies economic interdependence in a given area. The prevalence of AFVs should help ensure local demand for trained technicians and a fueling infrastructure. The availability of those services, in turn, makes the purchase of AFVs more attractive. When it works, the market becomes economically self-sustaining, with little or no government involvement.    The plan includes a host of new numerical data on fuel use and the numbers of vehicles that comprise all four targeted niche markets (see table, page 6). Gathered from various sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Census Bureau, trade publications, and studies by consulting firms, the information will be extremely useful for gauging market potential within individual coalition regions.    Clean Cities coalitions will probably recognize some of the specific niche market strategies contained in the plan. But these ""tried and true"" activities, such as Advancing the AFV Choice events, coupled with new tools and strategies will help ensure sustainable AFV niche markets. Other niche market development strategies include Tiger Teams, large-scale project funding, and a renewed focus on fleets required to purchase AFVs by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).    Clean Cities Tiger Teams are teams of experts, assembled by DOE, to assist coalitions with technical problems. Their expertise includes vehicle operations issues such as performance, safety, technician training, and driver acceptance; and fueling infrastructure issues such as station design and siting, and working with fuel providers. Tiger Teams can also help evaluate potential market opportunities and determine project feasibility. Coalitions are expected to exhaust other resources before applying for Tiger Team assistance. More information is available at  www.ccities.doe.gov/tiger.html .    Coalitions are encouraged to pursue large-scale AFV-related projects, with the support of certain public sources of funding. One source is the federal government's new AIR 21 Program, which will provide as much as $2 million each to 10 airports, for AFV projects. Another, larger source is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which has provided more than $270 million to more than 200 AFV projects since 1991.     Working with EPAct-mandated fleets, such as federal and state governments, is not a new concept for Clean Cities. Federal agencies, however, must comply with a  new executive order, signed last year, which requires federal fleets to use alternative fuel in their AFVs more than 50 percent of the time by 2005. And although EPAct does not require state fleets to actually use alternative fuel in their AFVs, many states have authorized alternative fuel refueling policies or have taken the initiative to mandate alternative fuel refueling policies.     As stated in the Clean Cities plan, these mandated fleets offer coalitions an opportunity to build a refueling infrastructure network in which stations are ensured significant throughput. And although local governments are not covered by EPAct mandates, as school buses are often an effective AFV application. The Clean Cities plan encourages coalitions to identify all government fleet operators, but especially those affected by federal legislation, and hold a niche-specific Advancing the AFV Choice event to help them choose vehicles and to develop a fueling infrastructure.     Among the new tools to assist coalitions in obtaining funds is a national database of CMAQ-funded alternative fuel projects. With support from a DOE grant, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute is analyzing national trends and creating the database help Clean Cities coalitions determine how CMAQ funds are allocated. Current data is more difficult to use due to the different reporting styles of state and local governments.     The Clean Cities plan also highlights the products and tools for cultivating niche markets, which resemble the ones available in the ""strong existing coalitions"" program area (described earlier). Educational workshops, for example, will offer training in specific niches, such as airports. Other new tools include educational software on alternative fuel school buses and a shuttle bus took kit for coalitions interested in airport shuttle projects. Communications resources such as fact sheets and case studies are also available in print and via the Clean Cities Web site,  www.ccities.doe.gov .    The Clean Cities strategic plan was distributed to all Washington Day 2001 participants and was mailed to coalition coordinators who were unable to attend. An electronic copy of the plan is posted on the Clean Cities Web site at  www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml .

Kateri Callahan of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas and Paul Kerkhoven of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition tackled legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development. They discussed recent events on Capitol Hill and reviewed potential upcoming legislation to encourage AFV and fuel-efficient vehicle purchases as well as alternative fuel infrastructure investments. For their presentations and more on possible legislation, check out the Clean Cities Web site at  www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml .     To address increased funding for AFVs and infrastructure projects, Doug Howell of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute and Jake Plante of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discussed two of the largest grant programs available-DOT's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) grants and FAA's AIR 21 grants for airport projects. Coalitions must work closely with their local metropolitan planning organizations to ensure CMAQ funds are used to support alternative fuel projects, said Howell.      An open-microphone ""mini-town hall meeting,"" held in the afternoon, prompted an informal dialogue among all participants about topics such as the state of the natural gas industry, public access vs. niche market infrastructure, upgrading aging fuel stations, alternative fuels used as blends, and administrative expenses in DOE State Energy Program grants.

Feature Stories    D iscouraging Idle Behavior     M ost people don't think about how their favorite pair of shoes found its way to the shelf at the shoe store-or how their favorite brand of ice cream made it to their grocer's freezer. But neither commodity-nor thousands of others-would be possible without long-haul trucks.     Nationwide, about 480,000 long-haul, heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7 and 8) deliver goods from one place to another. Many travel hundreds of miles daily and frequently stop overnight. Sleeper cabs provide drivers with spacious and comfortable accommodations, but to keep the engine warm in the winter and maintain the cab's climate control conditions, most drivers leave the engine idling. According to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) estimates, the average truck sits idling for up to 1,800 hours each year-an equivalent of 75 straight days.    Just one hour of idling burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year, ANL says. Idling reduces fuel economy and wears the engine, requiring operators to invest more in maintenance and repair. It also pollutes the air. ANL estimates that each year, long haul heavy-duty trucks produce 10 million tons of carbon dioxide, about 60,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, and nearly 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide just by idling.    Truck operators must stay warm in the winter and cool during the summer, but now there is an alternative to idling. ""Anti-idling devices"" include direct-fired burners for cab and engine block heating; thermal storage devices for heating and cooling; and auxiliary power units for heating, cooling, and electrical power. These devices use only 10% to 15% of the fuel a diesel truck engine uses to heat the engine or run cab heating and air conditioning. They are commercially available, easy to install, efficient, and relatively inexpensive to operate.    By burning less fuel, cab comfort units dramatically reduce harmful emissions and, perhaps more important to cost-conscious drivers, they can save the average long-haul truck operator as much as $1,900 each year in fuel costs alone. Less time idling also means less wear on the engine, which enables operators to save on preventative maintenance and repair costs as well.     Despite the benefits, truck operators are still reluctant to pay the initial cost of cab comfort units, which are typically about $3,000. But ANL estimates that the significant fuel and maintenance savings will help operators see a return on their investment after just one year of use.      DOE has launched a program to promote the use of cab comfort units. The message: Don't Idle Your Profits Away! DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) created an exhibit booth to showcase cab comfort technology and communicate the anti-idling message to truck operators at truck shows.     ""Some truck drivers think our efforts are designed to make them suffer in unheated or uncooled cabs,"" said OHVT's Sid Diamond. ""That is not at all our intent. Our goal is to show drivers that they really don't need a 600-horsepower diesel engine to run their trucks' climate control units and appliances. Today there are a number of options that provide more energy efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solutions to control cab comfort and safety.""

F utureTruck Students Rise to the Challenge     S port utility vehicles (SUVs) have emerged as the most popular single vehicle class in the United States. But they generally use more fuel and produce greater exhaust emissions than passenger cars. They're big, and getting bigger, in terms of both popularity and physical size. There's no doubt that SUVs are here to stay. The challenge is to create an SUV that meets the needs of the future, with better fuel efficiency and lower emissions, while retaining the comfort and performance that consumers have grown to expect.     Fifteen teams of university students are rising to meet the challenge through FutureTruck, a four-year competition sponsored by DOE and General Motors (GM). Through FutureTruck, university students are building the SUV of the future, using advanced technologies such as fuel cells, light-weight materials, innovative powertrain strategies, and alternative fuels. GM is supplying seed money, prize money, vehicles (Chevrolet Suburbans), and facilities for testing and evaluation. Ford Motor Company will become the automotive sponsor in 2002 and 2003.    FutureTruck student teams compete in a series of performance events including acceleration, trailer tow performance, off-road handling, and on-road fuel economy; as well as static design events, such as consumer acceptability and engineering design. The vehicles are tested for full fuel cycle analysis, and each team must also prepare a written and oral technical presentation.     Last year marked the start of the four-year FutureTruck competition. With less than five months to modify their vehicles, students managed to increase on-road fuel efficiency of their Chevrolet Suburbans by 13%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (compared to stock vehicles). For more on last year's FutureTruck competition, see AFN Vol. 4, No. 2, or visit  www.futuretruck.org .    What's it like to be a student participating in FutureTruck? ""It's inspiring,"" said Steve Gurski, team leader for Virginia Tech. ""In FutureTruck there's always a new challenge that no one has ever met before."" According to Gurski, undergraduate students and their team leaders spend as many as 30 hours per week on their vehicles. Team leaders-typically graduate students-spend even more time. They also help leverage funds and support for the project, write reports and waivers, and direct resources to help solve problems when necessary. Team leaders ensure that the team, and the vehicle, are ready for the June competition.     For many students, FutureTruck is a life-changing experience. ""I got involved because of the toys, not realizing what a difference it would make in my career,"" said Michael Ogburn, last year's team leader for Virginia Tech. ""Three years of playing with cars and trucks left me so aware of my passion to make a difference in the struggle to save the planet, that it makes my head spin to imagine doing anything else,"" he said.    The FutureTruck 2001 competition will be held June 4-13. Events will be held at the GM Proving Ground in Milford, Mich. Teams will then travel to Washington D.C. for an awards ceremony and vehicle display on Capitol Hill.

The NGNGV Program vision is to build one new medium-duty (Class 3-6) CNG truck, and one new heavy-duty (Class 7-8) LNG truck by 2004, using technologies to reduce emissions of particulate matter as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Typical NOx levels for today's low-emission natural gas trucks are in the range of 2-2.5 grams per brake-horsepower. The program has targeted NOx emissions of roughly one quarter of that level, at .5 grams.     Specific technological advances may take the form of improved engine-combustion designs, new dual-fuel systems, and better catalytic treatment of exhaust. The program is expected to draw interest from original equipment manufacturers as well as suppliers of sensors, engine-control systems, and fuel-air delivery systems. Information is available from Kevin Walkowicz at 303-275-4492, or at  www.ctts.nrel.gov/ngngv .     A lliance to Help Boost Green Vehicle Market    D OE is working with government and industry to help build a stronger market for ""green"" vehicles. A potential alliance of federal agencies, state and local governments, vehicle manufacturers, environmental groups, fuel associations, and universities has met several times to discuss joint efforts to increase demand for clean and efficient vehicles. The group's top priorities include market research to help define target audiences and shape public messages and an outreach campaign to alert the public of its clean vehicle choices. Stay tuned to AFN for more information on green vehicle activities.     P ropane Vehicle Rally     T he great American road rally was alive and well in early February as more than 20 propane powered vehicles converged on the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition in Kansas City, Missouri. The vehicles began their journeys at various locations throughout the West and Midwest, traveling along major interstates and stopping at propane refueling stations along the way. At each stop, drivers gave out information about the road rally and propane vehicles, and had a chance to interact with the public. They also collected signatures from the people they met during the rally into a logbook. Rally drivers traveled a combined total of more than 4600 miles and passed through 11 states and Monterrey, Mexico.     Approximately 27 government entities, associations, and companies worked together to make the road rally and propane conference a success. Sponsors included several Clean Cities coalitions, propane associations, propane distributors, and vehicle manufacturers. Ernie Oakes, the Regional Clean Cities Program Manager for the Department of Energy/Denver Regional Office applauded the venture and said, ""The rally showed local communities that the propane industry and automobile manufacturers are working together to bring a cleaner auto fuel to the general public for use in their everyday lives.""    Participating in the event were representatives of both government and private industry, from Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, and Monterrey, Mexico. The rally was the first event of its kind featuring dedicated propane vehicles.     On Monday, February 5, the rally participants arrived in Kansas City just in time for the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition. The conference featured displays from the major auto manufacturers, propane distributors, and propane associations. Lead vehicles from each leg of the rally were driven onto the conference floor, where they remained on display throughout the conference. The signatures that were collected at the road rally stops were also on display during the conference.      N iche Markets     Delivering Clean Air, Right to Your Door    Every day they travel from warehouses and local businesses to neighborhood stores and homes, delivering everything from flowers and dry-cleaned clothes to pizza and newspapers. Without delivery vehicles, we'd go without many of the amenities we've grown to depend on. And with e-commerce enabling Web users to order groceries and even the latest videos on-line, more and more consumers enjoy the convenience of home delivery.   As high-fuel use, high-mileage vehicles operating in small, defined geographic regions, delivery vehicles are ideal candidates for alternative fuels. According to the Census Bureau's most recent vehicle inventory and use survey, more than 5 million light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks are involved in cargo and freight delivery. More important, however, is that these vehicles use approximately 5.8 billion gallons  of fuel each year-obviously big potential for significant alternative fuel use (and significant petroleum displacement).    Several highly successful alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) delivery fleets - from large, national corporations like United Parcel Service to smaller, regional companies such as Salt Lake City's Newspaper Agency Corporation and Flower Patch, Inc.-are currently featured on the Clean Cities success stories Web site. Below are several other delivery companies that are also enjoying the benefits of AFV use.     McShan Florist, Dallas: The Dallas-Fort Worth Clean Cities Coalition recently recognized McShan for operating an almost 100% alternative fuel fleet. Twenty-five of the company's delivery vans (or 80% of its entire fleet) run on compressed natural gas (CNG). The vans refuel at local public stations, and owner Bruce McShan offers creative incentives to encourage drivers to fuel with CNG. McShan decided to start using CNG 10 years ago, and has enjoyed significant savings associated with CNG.     Connie's Pizza, Chicago: Since 1997, Connie's Pizza has been delivering pizza throughout the Chicago area, using CNG vehicles. Of the company's 50 vehicles, 18 are CNG Chevy S-10 pickups. Connie's also owns slow-fill compressors that refill vehicles overnight. According to Ivan Matsunaga at Connie's Pizza, the company initiated its AFV effort to comply with an Illinois Environmental Protection Agency rule that requires private fleets to purchase a certain number of AFVs. But there are other benefits. According to Matsunaga, it's the right thing to do environmentally, and the company benefits from the long-term economic advantage of using a less expensive fuel.     Schwan's Sales Enterprises, Marshall, Minn.: Schwan's Sales Enterprises manufactures, markets, and distributes frozen food to commercial and non-commercial customers in communities nationwide. An experienced AFV user, Schwan's has relied on propane for more than 22 years. Owner Marvin Schwan decided to convert his fleet to propane in response to gasoline shortages and unstable prices in the late 1970s. Today, the company's fleet is more than 90% alternative-fueled. Of its 7,500 vehicles, more than 7,000 are dedicated propane medium-duty vehicles. And with AFVs in 48 states, Schwan's is no stranger to the Clean Cities Program. The company is a Clean Cities stakeholder in the Atlanta, Colorado Springs, Evansville (Indiana), and California's Northwest Riverside County, as well as New York's Capital District, Central Oklahoma, Vermont, and the Alamo Area coalition in Texas.     According to Alan Macht, director of fleet operations, company AFVs travel about 190 million miles and consume 45 million gallons of propane annually. To ensure its success, Schwan's has taken a proactive approach to driver education, providing training in refueling and vehicle operations. Vehicles are refueled at the 600 Schwan's depots located across the country. According to Macht, the drivers have been pleased with vehicle performance. Because Schwan's truck operators are commissioned sales people, they have a higher stake in the vehicles. If their trucks don't function, drivers don't make money. As for expanding its AFV fleet, Macht said the company will first focus on larger urban, non-attainment areas.

USPS Delivers Clean Air and Energy Security   The United States Postal Service (USPS) is the nation's ultimate delivery fleet. Its vehicles travel more than 1 billion miles per year, collecting mail from more than 312,000 street mail collection boxes and delivering to every household in the country. And through rain, snow, sleet, and hail, the USPS does much more than deliver mail. With 33,691 alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) expected on the road by the end of the year, the USPS continues to be a leader in the drive to help strengthen our nation's energy security and clean the air.     By the end of the year, the USPS delivery fleet will include nearly 28,700 AFVs, most of which will be flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs). More than half of the projected 21,275 FFVs are already on the road; approximately 1,000 vehicles roll off the assembly line each month and are immediately placed into service. More than 7,300 USPS delivery vehicles are powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), and 52 vehicles use propane. Meanwhile, 523 electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to be on the road by the end of the year.     But there's more to USPS operation than delivery-some 4,519 AFVs either haul mail or are used for administrative business. For example, by the end of this year, 20 medium-duty EVs will be used to haul mail, while postal employees can drive any of the 3,838 FFVs or 659 CNG vehicles to conduct administrative business.     ""We are working closely with the alternative fuel industry to increase the use of each alternative fuel represented in the postal fleet,"" said Marguerite Downey, USPS Alternative Fuel Program Manager. ""For example, the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition and others are working with us to establish E85 pumps at fueling stations in communities where we are currently concentrating our FFVs. We are confident that our efforts will lead to continued expansion of alternative fuel usage in our own fleet, as well as neighboring fleets and individual drivers,"" she said.     F rom the Automakers     Hybrids are Big at Detroit's Auto Show    Hybrid sport utility vehicles (SUVs) took to the stage at the North American International Auto Show, held in Detroit in January. With the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius already on the streets and interest in energy efficiency on the rise, several automakers used the auto show as a forum to showcase their upcoming plans to bring advanced technology vehicles to market.     Ford Motor Company announced its plans for a hybrid Explorer, which will debut sometime after the Escape hybrid is introduced in 2003. Ford showcased the hybrid Escape at the Los Angeles International Auto Show a week before the show in Detroit. The Escape, expected to get 40 miles per gallon, will use an electric motor for propulsion and a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Explorer will use a six-cylinder engine with electric assist. Both models will feature integrated starter-generator technology that automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops, such as at a traffic light. The Explorer hybrid will also employ a regenerative braking system for its 42-volt battery used to provide an acceleration boost at start up. A smaller 12-volt battery will supplement power to run devices such as lamps and radios. For more information, check out Ford's hybrid Web site:  www.hybridford.com .    Among the newest concepts DaimlerChrysler unveiled at the Detroit auto show was the Dodge PowerBox, a hybrid-electric SUV. Unlike other hybrid SUVs, the PowerBox combines a supercharged V-6 engine that uses compressed natural gas (CNG) and an electric motor to supplement power and increase efficiency. A large SUV, the PowerBox concept has room for eight passengers, comparable in size to the gasoline-powered Dodge Durango, but with 60% better fuel economy. And because it's powered primarily by CNG, the PowerBox runs cleaner, with near zero emissions. For more information, visit  www.daimlerchrysler.com .     Building on last year's Precept hybrid concept vehicle, General Motors unveiled its new hybrid propulsion system, the ParadiGM, which the company will be able to apply to a variety of vehicles, from passenger sedans to SUVs and trucks to commercial vehicles. The ParadiGM system combines a conventional V-6 or an inline four-cylinder engine with two electric motors and a battery pack to provide increased efficiency. The first hybrid application will be a mid-size SUV with fuel economy 20% better than its conventionally powered counterparts. GM's hybrid SUV is expected to debut in 2004; the company announced that at least 7,000 vehicles will be produced in the first year. More hybrids may follow, depending on market demand. For more information on GM's ParadiGM system, visit  www.gm.com .

Honda Civic GX receives California's AT-PZEV certification    The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in late December granted American Honda Motor Company partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV) certification for its natural-gas-powered Civic GX.     The rating came just weeks before the 2001 model car, described by the manufacturer as ""cleanest on earth,"" hit the U.S. market.    The standard, which falls under the super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) provision of CARB's recently released ZEV mandate, requires vehicles to support 15-year, 150,000 mile emission system durability. They must also have zero evaporative emissions. Under this stringent SULEV requirement, the Civic GX is now the first advanced-technology, partial-zero emission vehicle (AT-PZEV) says Stephen Ellis, American Honda's Manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicles.     An AT-PZEV gets distinct recognition and greater credits because it has a reduced ""full cycle"" emissions impact. ""Being the first to receive AT-PZEV status is nice for Honda and the near-zero emission Civic GX. It also proves the value of natural gas as a long-term alternative to gasoline,"" Ellis says.    Approved in January, CARB's new ZEV rule will require the sale of an estimated 4,650 full-size model year 2003 electric cars in California, and a comparable number of other super-clean and advanced technology vehicles as well. The ZEV minimums will rise to about 22,000 vehicles in 2010, and 50,000 in 2018. The SULEV provision allows car manufacturers to receive partial credits with PZEVs, including AT-PZEVs such as the Civic GX.      DaimlerChrysler Adds Neighborhood Electric Vehicles to Its Portfolio    DaimlerChrysler announced its acquisition of Global Electric MotorCars (GEM), becoming the first major automaker to sell neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) in the United States.    GEM, based in North Dakota, produces two- and four-passenger NEVs that can be licensed for use on public roads. The vehicles recharge in about eight hours using 110-volt household alterative current. NEVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are well suited for niche applications including local governments, parking enforcement, university and business campuses, and planned communities. The city of Denver, for example, through its ""Take Charge"" program, provides three NEVs for city employees to use for business downtown.     ""DaimlerChrysler is excited about the emerging market of neighborhood electric vehicles and the opportunities that GEM affords,"" said Mike Clement, Director of Alternative Fuel Sales and Marketing. ""This acquisition fits well with DaimlerChrysler's alternative fuel vehicle strategy.""      C lean Cities Roundup     Animals Need Clean Air, Too    The animals-and their keepers-at the Tulsa Zoo can all breathe a little easier, thanks to the zoo's electric vehicles. The zoo uses two electric Ford Rangers and three electric ""trikes"" (bicycles with three wheels) to travel from building to building. The pickups are also used in daily grounds-keeping activities. The Tulsa Zoo is a division of Tulsa Parks, a member of the Tulsa Area Clean Cities Coalition.      Birmingham Boasts Natural Gas Buses    The Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) has joined a growing number of transit agencies across the country in a commitment to use compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. The BJCTA is 57% alternative-fueled; of its 77 buses, 43 use CNG. According to Mark Bond, Director of Fleet Operations for City Transit (a BJCTA contractor), drivers are particularly pleased with the new buses' power and acceleration. Each of the CNG buses is clearly marked as a clean fuel vehicle, to help inform Birmingham residents of their transportation choices. The city of Birmingham is working towards a Clean Cities designation.       Oklahoma Utility Nears 100% Alternative Fuel Use    Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) is closing in on 100% alternative fuel use. Of the utility's 1,120 vehicles, more than 800 (or 71.4%) run on natural gas. According to ONG's John Siska, last year the fleet used approximately 500,000 gallons of natural gas, and it plans to use more. ""Our goal is to reach 100% of our fleet,"" said Siska. ""Any vehicle that can possibly be converted and is close to refueling will either be converted or replaced with an original equipment vehicle,"" he said. Last year, Natural Gas Fuels ranked ONG third on its list of the top utility natural gas fleets, and the utility tied for first in alternative fuel vehicle projections. ONG is an active member of the Clean Cities coalitions of central Oklahoma and the Tulsa area.      Three New Coalitions Join Clean Cities Program    By summer 2001, more than 80 coalitions will be part of the Clean Cities network. Each new coalition is the first in its state to join the Clean Cities Program.     Triangle Clean Cities, which serves the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, was designated the 80th Clean Cities coalition on March 19. Because the event was within driving distance from Washington, DC, several members of DOE's Clean Cities team showed their support for the coalition and for AFVs by driving the more than 250 miles to North Carolina in a natural gas vehicle and a propane vehicle. The Triangle Clean Cities Coalition's designation celebration, held at North Carolina State University, was part of an event staged to help advance fuel choices in the area. With flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) making up a majority of the region's more than 1,700 vehicles, the coalition remains active in promoting the increased use of E85. Last year, then-Governor Jim Hunt issued a proclamation announcing his support for the Triangle Clean Cities effort and mandating E85 use in state fleets whenever possible.     The Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition (TC4) will become the 81st member of the program on May 31, 2001. The TC4, in conjunction with the Minnesota E85 team, has been successful in building an alternative fuel infrastructure network, and last year celebrated the opening of the region's 50th publicly accessible E85 station. With its partners, the TC4 has also initiated a large-scale educational and outreach effort to promote E85 use by the public, and has set specific fuel use and fuel sales goals to help target its efforts.    The Vermont Clean Vehicles Coalition is planning a designation ceremony for this summer. The coalition serves one of the most rural Clean Cities regions of the country. It has promoted alternative fuels for several years, and has received significant media attention for having placed AFVs in fleets throughout the state. The coalition is also unique in terms of active participation by government leaders, including both of Vermont's U.S. Senators, its congressional representative, and its governor.     F ederal News     DOE Names Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Project Recipients    DOE's Federal AFV USER Program recently awarded funds for three separate projects, designed to increase the availability of alternative fuels such as E85 and compressed natural gas (CNG). The successful entries were chosen from proposals submitted in response to a solicitation in June 2000.     The Federal AFV USER Program supports the expansion of alternative fuel infrastructure by encouraging the placement and use of federally owned AFVs in six specific cities: San Francisco; Denver; Albuquerque; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Salt Lake City; and Melbourne-Titusville, Fla.    Roughly $266,000 in federal funding was awarded for the three projects, which have a combined total value of $812,000 including the cost share contributed by non-federal partners. Each partner's contribution was at least 50%. Generally, the projects will support fleet managers and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) buyers. They include:    The Twin Cities AFV USER project, ""Using the Federal Fleet to Model the E85 Way,"" a customer education and marketing project that promotes the use of E85 fuel, $214,000;  Pinnacle CNG Co.'s DOE/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) CNG Refueling Station, for the installation and operation of a CNG fueling station at LLNL, $465,000; and   The Technological Research and Development Authority's deployment of ethanol fuel infrastructure for federal fleets in Melbourne-Titusville, for the installation and operation of an E85 fueling station at the Kennedy Space Center, $184,000.   Because federal fleets are required by Executive Order 13149 to reduce petroleum consumption, DOE is targeting infrastructure and promotion projects to benefit them. Although the primary intent of the projects is to support the federal fleet, they were also evaluated by their potential to provide alternative fuel to state and local government fleets, commercial fleets, and the public.

Second-round Rebate Funding Now Available     Coalitions that received rebates from Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) program in 2000 may be eligible for a second wave of funding. To qualify, coalitions have to have exhausted the money granted in the first round of rebates.    Formed to help coalitions reduce the cost of AFVs, the program offers rebates of $2,000 per vehicle to coalition stakeholders who purchase AFVs. Under the terms of the deal, the funding must be used to buy dedicated original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alternative fuel vehicles.    For more information, contact your Department of Energy (DOE) Regional Clean Cities manager.     Fleet Buyer's Guide Adds Electric Bikes, Hybrids, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles     Electric bikes, hybrid cars, and neighborhood electric vehicles were recently added to DOE's Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide. The site walks fleet managers through a step-by-step process that helps them identify whether Energy Policy Act (EPAct) regulations apply to them, and, if so, helps them make informed alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase decisions.     Although electric bikes, HEVs, and neighborhood electric vehicles don't qualify for EPAct credit, they were added to the Web site because many fleets are interested in purchasing them. Currently the Buyer's Guide has specifications and information on two HEVs, eight neighborhood electric vehicles, and more than a dozen electric bikes. Although the site was developed to assist fleets, the public is welcome to use it.    Visit  www.fleets.doe.gov , and click on the link for Advanced Technology Vehicles.      Where in the World are Alternative Fuels?    The redesigned Clean Cities International Web site answers that and many other questions about Clean Cities around the world. The site, which features a special section in Spanish, is packed with detailed information about the program, the countries and cities involved, new publications, upcoming international events, and much more. Modeled after DOE's Clean Cities Program, Clean Cities International works with governments, non-governmental organizations, and the U.S. alternative fuel industry to help establish foundations for viable alternative fuel markets in other interested countries.

We reflected how the disruption in our nation's petroleum supply upset the lives of many Americans. Now we look forward to our nation's progress as we face a new year, a new century, a new millennium, and the bright promise that clean energy technologies hold for our future.  The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) leads the research, development, and deployment of clean, efficient, and renewable energy technologies. These technologies play a big role in meeting our nation's energy needs, enhancing our natural environment, and strengthening our national competitiveness in the production of sustainable energy. The results of this leadership are dramatic; the United States now has a more efficient industrial base, a robust energy technology industry, and significant energy savings in our homes, vehicles, offices, and government buildings. Clean energy also requires clean vehicles and clean alternative fuels, such as those being promoted by the nationwide Clean Cities network. Clean fuels provide lower emissions, use less petroleum, and are often renewable, paving the way to a sustainable transportation future. As we enter the new millennium, the clean energy technologies supported and promoted by DOE will continue to play a key role in providing Clean Energy for the 21st Century.  ""Clean Energy for the 21st Century"" is the theme EERE has adopted to promote events and activities leading up to Earth Day 2000. This theme describes the goals and objectives of EERE programs, like Clean Cities, Building America, and Million Solar Roofs, and also coincides with the Earth Day Network's Earth Day 2000 theme of ""New Energy for a New Era."" The Earth Day Network, a non-profit organization established by Earth Day founding father Denis Hayes, is planning a series of events leading to Earth Day 2000, the 30th anniversary of the first Earth Day. The network hopes to raise awareness of global warming and climate change issues, and promote a ""rapid transition from outdated, polluting, wasteful energy systems to efficient systems built on clean, safe, renewable energy sources."" For more information about the Earth Day Network, check out http://www.earthday.net. For more information about DOE's energy efficiency programs, including Building America, Million Solar Roofs, and others, go to http://www.eren.doe.gov/millionroofs. DOE's ""Clean Energy for the 21st Century"" campaign kicks off during October, which has traditionally been celebrated as Energy Awareness Month, and will culminate on Earth Day 2000. Many transportation-related activities and events are planned throughout October. The Model Year 2000 Fuel Economy Guide, although not available in hard copy until late in November, was also posted on the Web. The guide is an interagency effort between DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It will help consumers compare the fuel economy of Model Year (MY) 2000 vehicles, including cars, light trucks, minivans, sport utility vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). ""Our goal was to make the 2000 guide more readable and used by more people,"" said David Rodgers, Director of DOE's Office of Technology Utilization. ""We're also proud of the dramatically redesigned Web site that showcases alternative fuel and advanced technologies, allows side-by-side comparison of vehicles, and highlights other environmental attributes of MY2000 vehicles,"" he said. To view the MY2000 Fuel Economy Guide online, or to search the database of previous model year Fuel Economy Guides, check out: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg.  3   There is much anticipation about the new model year.

The vehicles include two hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)-- the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius--and Ford's electric vehicle (EV), the TH!NK. Honda's Insight and Toyota's Prius will be the first HEVs ever available to U.S. consumers. The introduction of the HEVs will help spur competition among all automakers in pursuit of early market entry for advanced, highly efficient vehicles. To increase fuel economy and lower emissions, HEVs employ both a gasoline-powered engine and an electric motor to power the vehicle. The battery pack for the motor is recharged by the engine, which acts as a generator, and also from the electricity generated by braking. This hybrid technology, which results in better fuel economy, means the batteries never have to be recharged from an outside source. Honda's Insight will go on sale this December. The Insight will be certified to meet California's ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) standards, and is powered by Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. The hybrid technology, along with a lightweight aluminum body structure and aerodynamic design, enables the two-passenger Insight to average more than 70 miles per gallon on the highway, according to Honda. Honda showcased the Insight at a reception in Washington, D.C., September 23-24, 1999. The event, held for White House, DOE, EPA staff, and the press at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, included a ride-and-drive opportunity for attendees. A one-hour briefing was also held at DOE the next day to promote staff exposure to the new technology. Following this briefing, five Insights were available to test drive. Although Toyota's four-door sedan, the Prius, will arrive in the United States after Honda's HEV, it won't be far behind, with an expected entrance in early 2000. The Prius has the distinction of being the world's first production HEV, demonstrating impressive sales and getting great reviews in Japan since it was introduced there in December 1997. The Toyota Hybrid System (THS) also employs advanced technology, making use of both an electric motor and a gasoline engine to increase fuel economy and lower emissions. The Prius, a four-door sedan, uses a 1.5liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a permanent magnet motor powered by a sealed nickel-metal hydride battery to give it an estimated fuel economy of 66 miles per gallon (based on actual city test driving in Japan). The all-electric TH!NK, a two-seater measuring only 10 feet in length, is manufactured by Pivco Industries Ltd., a Norwegian subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Ford plans to market vehicles in the U.S. next year, after its introduction in Norway. TH!NK is constructed with a Wieck Photo Database  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07326  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07325  Pictured top to bottom: A look under the hood of the Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle; Honda Insight; Ford Th!nk electric city vehicle; Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle  Wieck Photo Database  combination of aluminum and thermoplastics, providing body strength and light weight. According to Ford, the battery pack gives the vehicle a ""real world"" range of about 50 miles between charges, and its 27 kW alternating current (AC) induction motor gives it a top speed of 55 mph. The plant in Oslo, Norway, is scheduled to produce 1,500 vehicles in 2000. The Insight, Prius, and TH!NK offer exciting glimpses into the automotive technologies of the near future. Although electric vehicles are already in production in the United States, the TH!NK shows that automakers are dedicated to developing and promoting EVs. The advanced vehicle technology that has been the ""talk of the industry"" is almost here!

DOE's Dan Reicher, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, welcomed the Florida Space Coast Clean Cities Coalition in a ceremony held at the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cocoa, Florida. The designation kicked off Energy Awareness Month, and also provided an opportunity to inaugurate the MelbourneTitusville-Kennedy Space Center area as one of the six selected locations for the new Federal AFV USER Program (see p. 10 for more on the USER program). The Florida Space Coast Clean Cities Coalition serves a nine county area in eastcentral Florida, including Brevard, Indian River, Lake, Seminole, St. Lucie, Osceola, Orange, Okeechobee, and Volusia Counties. Prominent stakeholders include the Florida Solar Energy Center, NASA-Kennedy Space Center, Walt Disney World, City Gas Company, People's Gas, and the United States Postal Service. #76  Manhattan, Kansas On October 4, the ""Little Apple"" was officially designated into the Clean Cities Program. DOE's Richard Moorer, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technologies, joined Manhattan Mayor Roger Reitz to celebrate Manhattan as the 76th Clean Cities Coalition. The ceremony, which was held outside the downtown shopping mall, included a vehicle display and vendor booths, and was held at 5:00 p.m. to maximize public attendance. Earlier that day, the Manhattan coalition celebrated the opening of a publicly accessible natural gas refueling station. Manhattan stakeholders include the city of Manhattan, Kansas; Kansas State University; Fort Riley; and Transportation Design and Manufacturing, a local AFV conversion company.  The 17th National Natural Gas Vehicle Conference and Exhibition was also held during Energy Awareness Month, October 3-5, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The agenda featured special ""tracks"" tailor-made for fleet managers. Topics included: how to get started with NGVs, emissions issues, refueling infrastructure, regulations, and a special session on partnerships among original equipment manufacturers and their customers.  Ford Excursion to Roam the Rockies Kids at the Boys and Girls Club in Denver now have a new, spacious, CLEAN ride ready to transport them to their next outdoor adventure. On October 14th, after announcing the availability of its dedicated propane-powered Excursion in MY20 0 0, representatives from Ford Motor Company presented the keys to one of the new propane, super-ultra-low emission vehicles to Denver 's Mayor Wellington Webb. Mayor Webb then passed the keys, along with camping gear also donated by Ford, to the local Boys and Girls Club. Now they had the vehicle to get to the campsite and the gear to camp, but what about the fuel? That's when Amerigas stepped in. In addition to announcing the development of a new public propane station in Denver, Amerigas donated 50 0 gallons of the fuel to the Boys and Girls Club to help them power their new Ford Excursion.  The 2nd Annual Riverside Clean Cities/ICTC Fleet Operator Workshop The Northwest Riverside County Clean Cities Coalition will celebrate its second anniversary as a designated member of the Clean Cities Program on October 27th. Similar to the coalition's anniversary celebration last year, the event will be held in conjunction with the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC) Fleet Operator Workshop. The focus will be on heavy-duty vehicle use in California, Nevada, and Arizona, and will include panel presentations and table talk sessions with alternative fuel fleet operators.  6  Ford Motor Company/PIX 07369  NGV Conference and Exhibition   Spotlight on Niche Markets  The Sky's the Limit for Airport AFVs  When most people think of the airport, airplanes--obviously-- come to mind. But what about all the ground services that transport people, baggage, airline equipment, and food service to make everything run smoothly? Airports across the nation have been looking at the pollution caused by these ground transportation services as a perfect opportunity to use alternative fuels and vehicles to improve the air quality in and around the airports.  Los Angeles, California Serving 61.2 million passengers each year provides Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) with a great opportunity to expose travelers to AFVs. LAX leads the introduction of AFVs into airports by working with local agencies, which include the city of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) and the Southern California Gas Company. More than 300 airline, hotel, motel, and rental car operators experience AFVs firsthand, and many are considering them for their own fleets. Currently, LAX is scheduled to have 35% of its fleet running on alternative fuels by the end of this year, with the goal of a 50% alternative fuel fleet by the year 2003. LAX has demonstrated its early commitment to the AFV program by actively pursuing the use of AFVs since 1993. The airport's alternative fuel infrastructure consists of LNG, CNG, and electric refueling/charging stations. LAX operates 43 LNG transit buses, each able to transport 45 passengers. Six additional LNG buses have been ordered; delivery is expected in 2000. LAX's vehicle replacement program will continue to substitute diesel buses with LNG buses until the entire fleet of 52 is converted to natural gas, which is expected by the year 2001. CNG vehicles, including a street sweeper and recycling collection vehicle, are used primarily by the LAX daily maintenance crews in and around the airport. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) also has CNG dedicated and bifuel vehicles, which are used by airport police, airfield operations, landside operations, and other bureaus. LAX has ordered CNG sedans and pickups, and has gotten approval to purchase more CNG vehicles for fiscal year 19992000. LAWA has partnered with DWP to introduce 10 public electric vehicle charging stations, and 20 more are on the way.  And now you can rent an AFV... Planes are not the only vehicles taking off at airports in California. The popularity of alternative fuel rental cars is soaring. Budget EV Rental Cars offers EVs for rent at LAX, and has recently expanded its selection to include the dedicated CNG Honda Civic GX. The electric vehicles available include the Honda EV Plus, Ford Ranger, GM EV1, Toyota RAV-4, DaimlerChrysler EPIC minivan, and the Nissan Altra. Electric recharging stations are available to EV renters through a partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and natural gas vehicle renters receive fueling cards from Pickens Fuel and Southern California Gas Company that give them access to the many natural gas refueling stations in the Los Angeles area. Budget EV Rental Cars is also expanding its service locations. An EV Rental Center is now open at the Sacramento airport. The rental fleet includes 20 EVs, which are being offered for rental at rates as low as $44 per day, and charging is free at the 10 0 electric charging stations in the Sacramento area. With the support of Senators Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Congressman Ron Packard (R-CA), plans are underway to add additional centers at the airports in Burbank, Orange County, and Ontario.

Nan Miller, DFW Clean Cities  Sacramento, California In northern California, the capital city of Sacramento has actively reduced total air emissions by 15% since 1985, while doubling their passenger activities. Among the many partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies, Sacramento International Airport (SMF) has developed a comprehensive program to reduce air pollutant emissions from ground transportation sources. Sacramento County's Department of Airports has heavily invested in low emission AFVs and the associated fueling infrastructure. The airport fleet of CNG shuttle buses, trucks, and vans rely on a public access CNG refueling station built at the airport. SuperShuttle uses the CNG station every day to refuel its growing fleet of CNG-powered vans. In addition, special electric vehicle recharging stations have been installed in the parking lots. And finally, AFV rental vehicles are also available at the airport. In addition to alternative fuels, the Sacramento airport supports other efforts to reduce emissions from ground transportation by offering public transit, trip reduction, rideshare matches, incentive programs, and improved parking facilities.  American Airlines uses electric powered baggage tractors and belt loaders at DFW  approximately 200 gasoline-powered vehicles at the airport in the past year, and plans to replace another 100. According to Greg Rivera, Ground Equipment Specialist, ""American Airlines is committed to purchasing all electric baggage tractors and belt loaders."" In conjunction with state and regional officials, DFW is close to completing a study on the potential government uses for AFVs, which will show different ways for governments to blend their buying power and encourage research. The study should be completed this fall. Also, a new state plan developed by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission will assess where emissions can be reduced, which may include airports. This study is expected out in early 2000.  Denver, Colorado Denver International Airport (DIA) in Colorado serves as an environmental model for other airports across the country. Among the many environmental initiatives the airport has undertaken to reduce pollution since it opened in 1995, one of the most exciting and visible is its AFV program. According to Terry Henry, DIA's Assistant Deputy Manager of Aviation for Fleet Maintenance, the airport and its tenants (including the airlines and concessionaires) have about 1,000 electric and natural gas vehicles in their combined fleet. The AFVs at the airport include baggage tractors, police sedans, pickup trucks, cargo and passenger vans, transit buses, and rental cars. Paul Nelson, Vice President of Natural Fuels Company, noted that the forklifts and enginelifts in the airplane hangars run on natural gas. ""Three-anda-half years ago [when the airport opened], there were fewer than 400 [natural gas] vehicles; now there are over 500. So in that time more than 100 [natural gas] vehicles have been added,"" explains Nelson, who has been involved with DIA's alternative fuels program since it began. Most of the AFVs at the airport run on natural gas. According to Nelson, the city and county of Denver (owner of the airport) has the largest natural gas vehicle (NGV) fleet with 220 vehicles. United Airlines, which uses DIA as a major hub, has 120 NGVs in their large alternative fuel fleet. To keep these DIA-based AFVs fueled and charged, the airport has eight natural gas refueling stations, several electric recharging facilities, and one liquefied-petroleum gas (LPG) station on the premises. Six of the natural gas stations are ""airside,"" meaning they are in a secure area for  Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas Dallas has taken big steps toward reducing air pollution emissions from the Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) airport. The DFW Airport Board has a long-term goal of converting 50% of its fleet to operate on alternative fuels. Efforts to support the Airport Board's commitment have been boosted by the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which is developing an implementation plan to incorporate alternative fuels at the airport. This process will entail surveying fleets near airport facilities, conducting cost evaluations, and creating public outreach materials. DFW has also adopted a policy requiring half of all taxis and shuttle service vans to run on clean-burning fuels within 5 years. Most of the funding for the new AFVs will come from a $632,000 state grant. Jim Crites, DFW Deputy Executive Director of Airport Operations, said ""the goals of DFW include plans to have 289 AFVs by 2005 and 344 by 2010."" In an attempt to meet these goals, the board recently agreed to purchase 54 CNG vehicles, which will include buses, alternative fuel police patrol sedans, and pickups. American Airlines, one of DFW's major tenants, committed $20 million for the purchase of more than 300 electric-powered baggage tractors and belt loaders for use in airside operations. To aid American's effort, DFW approved the installation of electric power recharging stations at airport gates. American Airlines has replaced  8   Denver International Airport  growing area with air quality concerns. Finally, the airport and community have demonstrated their strong commitment to energy efficiency and environmental programs, which includes an active alternative fuels industry. Future plans are expansive and include incorporating maximum energy efficiency into the new airport buildings and AFVs. GAI stakeholders conducted five working group meetings, which included participants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state agencies, Salt Lake City Mayor Corradini's office, the Airport Authority, the Olympic Committee, and others. The AFV working group was successful, in part due to Delta Airlines' interest in making the new airport capable of providing electric power to support charging facilities for electric airside vehicles. Other ideas that took shape include refinements to the existing state AFV incentive legislation, exploring AFV mandates for city-owned fleets, and concessionaire agreements with airport tenants to increase the use of AFVs. Potential advanced technology vehicles (ATVs) and AFV use at the airport may include:  Shuttle buses and transit vehicles  Baggage tractors and belt loaders  Rental cars  Refueling and recharging stations  Retrofitting existing engines. Many federal programs can indirectly support the GAI. For example, the Clean Cities Program often provides financial support to offset the capital costs of AFVs and their infrastructure. State and local governments can also play an important role in supporting the GAI through tax waivers, loan programs incentives, and more. Individuals can help, too. Programs are available to provide products at discounted rates in exchange for promotional opportunities; innovative financing--such as that from fueling companies that defrays capital investments through long-term fuel contracts--can be had; low interest loan programs are obtainable for community projects through local financial institutions.

Two natural gas refueling stations have been placed ""landside,"" meaning they are accessible by rental cars, passenger vans, transit buses, and the public. According to Denver 's Clean Cities Coordinator Deborah Kielian, ""Denver Clean Cities is looking to initiate the 'Clean Tents Program,' which will help provide information to airport passengers regarding the great strides that DIA is making with AFVs."" The Clean Tents name was created to reflect the architecture of the airport terminal. Denver has been a leader in the use of AFVs in airport fleets to combat air pollution for several years. The outlook is bright for DIA fleets to incorporate more AFVs. Nelson said that United Airlines just put 40 dedicated natural gas baggage tractors into service last summer, and added that ""the AFV effort at the airport is strongly supported by the airlines, the city of Denver, and the concessionaires, so it will continue to grow.""  Salt Lake City, Utah The ""Green Airport Initiative"" (GAI) is well under way at the Salt Lake International Airport (SLA). Earlier this year, the Clean Airport Partnership, the Salt Lake City Clean Cities Coalition, and the Airport Authority met to strategize on expanding the use of AFVs at the airport. They discussed many opportunities for illustrating how innovative technology, energy efficient design and planning, and alternative fuels can work together to breed smart growth and development, and the GAI was born. Why is Salt Lake City the ideal place to implement the GAI? With the 2002 Winter Olympics approaching, the eyes of the world will be on Salt Lake, giving the city and the airport maximum exposure. Salt Lake City is also a fast  Clean Cities Program Awards Rebates to Coalition Stakeholders Over the past two years, the Clean Cities Program has targeted efforts toward ""Advancing the AFV Choice,"" or making it easier for fleets across the country to choose alternative fuels. The strategy behind Advancing the AFV Choice includes computer-based tools, such as the AFV Fleet Buyer 's Guide and Preferred Fleets Database. Another critical piece of the strategy is the AFV rebate program, which helps offset the incremental cost of coalition stakeholder AFV purchases. Last spring, many Clean Cities coalitions submitted proposals requesting funds to help support stakeholder vehicle purchases--to facilitate their ""AFV Choice."" The rebates were recently awarded and have since contributed to the purchase of more than 530 AFVs in Clean Cities across the country. In addition, many coalitions that received rebate funds integrated the money into their own established rebate programs. They plan to offer their stakeholder fleets rebates to buy down the cost of their AFVs with these funds. A second round of rebate funding is anticipated to be available by the end of calendar year 1999. Stay tuned to AFN for details.  9   Federal News Clinton Clears the Way for Biomass On August 12, 1999, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13134 that will help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil, improve air quality, and meet environmental challenges such as global warming. This comprehensive national strategy aims to triple the use of biomass products by 2010. The order, ""Developing and Promoting Biobased Products and Bioenergy,"" will expand the production of clean fuels--such as ethanol-- as well as other bioenergy products. According to the White House press release, bioenergy and bioproducts can dramatically reduce global warming ""by reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by up to 100 million tonsthe What exactly is a equivalent of taking more than biobased product? 70 million cars off the road.""

Order discusses the ""potential to expand the use of biobased products and bioenergy by federal agencies,"" which includes the use of biofuels in federal vehicles. The order specifies that federal efforts must be coordinated to speed the development of 21st century biobased industries that use trees, crops, agricultural, and forestry wastes to make fuels, chemicals, and electricity. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, along with other agencies, are directed to prepare a report within 120 days from issuance of the order that contains options for modifying existing agency programs to promote the order. Many factors should be considered, such as the impact of greenhouse gases, biobased products manufactured from fossil fuels, and emissions of criteria pollutants of biobased products. The report will describe outreach efforts to raise the nation's awareness of the useful applications, benefits, and costs of producing biobased products. Federal leadership is required to aid in the progress of these technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace. The new ""research management team,"" as referred by the White House, will focus on the following goals:  Establishing the Interagency Council on Biobased Products to develop a detailed biomass research program to be presented annually as part of the federal budget;  Directing the Council to review major agency regulations, incentives, and programs to ensure that they effectively promote the use of bioproducts and bioenergy; and  Creating an outside Advisory Committee on Biobased Products and Bioenergy with representatives from biobased industries, farm and forestry sectors, universities, and environmental groups. Following the President's Executive Order on bioenergy, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson announced more than $13 million in funds will be dedicated to promoting the development of the biomass industry. DOE will fund 18 projects to further the development of technologies that can reduce the cost of using biomass to create new energy, fuels, and products. How can this new national strategy be implemented most effectively? The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's John Sheehan presented his views to the Environmental Vehicle Conference last June.

For more information on the Executive Order, visit the White House Web site at http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/retrieve-documents.html  Federal Fleet Concentrates AFVs in Selected Cities Why are the operators of many federal fleet vehicles that are built to use alternative fuels (flex-fuel or bi-fuel vehicles) opting to use conventional fuels instead? To all those frustrated with this situation, rest assured that federal operators will soon be filling tanks with alternative fuels, at least in six major metropolitan areas. In a proactive step to address the issue of low alternative fuel use in federal fleets, an interagency task force, led by the Department of Energy (DOE) and General Services Administration (GSA), has developed the Federal AFV USER Program (USER is actually an acronym that stands for Utilization Supporting Expansion of Refueling--try that in your next trivia game!). The USER Program's goal is to support the expansion of the alternative fuel infrastructure by concentrating large quantities of federal AFVs--and substantially increasing their use of alternative fuel--in six selected cities. All AFVs purchased through the program are required to operate on alternative fuel. By focusing efforts to build the federal AFV fleet in specific areas, the government encourages market development by increasing local alternative fuel station throughput and building a foundation for confident investments in additional refueling infrastructure  10   development. The cities were selected according to specific criteria, including the number of leased GSA and U.S. Postal Service vehicles in the area, as well as the level of support and demonstrated commitment to AFV use from local GSA representatives, federal fleets, automobile manufacturers, and alternative fuel providers. The selected cities were announced at the program's national kick-off meeting held during the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in May 1999 (see box for cities).

However, the money is not intended to cover the entire incremental cost of the vehicles; local fleets must contribute as well, as part of their demonstrated commitexclude other cities or restrict those with federal fleets interested in acquiring AFVs from doing so. ""We welcome and strongly encourage AFV use in all federal fleets operating in cities all across the country,"" said Slezak.

We expect the federal fleets to be leaders in the use of AFVs.""  Nuts and Bolts Have You Called the Clean Cities or Alternative Fuels Hotline Lately?

It preys upon the vulnerable in communities across the country. Suburban neighborhoods are no longer a safe haven, as it sweeps beyond city limits, wreaking havoc wherever it goes. It's not Godzilla...it's...it's...SMOGZILLA! Smogzilla is just one of the innovations developed by the Norwich Clean Cities Coalition to raise awareness of clean air issues in its community. ""We knew grade school kids would need something a little more active and engaging to help them understand the importance of AFVs,"" said Norwich Clean Cities Consultant Carol Butler. That's what prompted the coalition to work with the National Children's Theater to develop a play about pollution, AFVs, and clean ecosystems, featuring the big smog monster. Smogzilla stomped its way though elementary schools in the Norwich community, teaching children about air pollution issues and how alternative fuel vehicles, like the natural gas buses they ride to school every day, can help clean the air they breathe. Two versions of the play were developed: one for fourth through sixth grade students, and a modified, simpler version for kids in kindergarten through third grade. Both were a big hit with the students. ""The kids were enthralled...when it came time for audience participation, every hand went up,"" said Butler. It was also a hit with the press, as the effort was highlighted in the local newspaper. The coalition followed up its Smogzilla tour by making books and videos about AFVs and clean air available to the schools' libraries. Stakeholders are now looking into ways to bring the Smogzilla play to schools across the state. The city of Norwich was designated the 32nd member of DOE's Clean Cities Program on November 21, 1994. Serving a community of just 35,000 people in southeastern Connecticut, the coalition is one of the smallest in the country, but, despite its size, it has taken big steps to promote alternative fuels and AFVs. ""The progress the coalition has made in advancing AFV technology throughout John Kubesh/PIX 04152 City of Norwich Dept. of Public Utilities  DOE's Mike Scarpino visits with Smogzilla after a performance at a Norwich elementary school  the community is amazing,"" said DOE's Mike Scarpino, Clean Cities Program Manager for the Boston Region. According to Norwich Clean Cities Coordinator, Peter Polubiatko of the Norwich Department of Public Utilities, it's all a matter of getting the community involved. The coalition holds monthly meetings, and stakeholders are given responsibilities for management and coordination of coalition activities, including public outreach and education. ""Their outreach program is the best in the region, hands down,"" said Scarpino. The coalition has worked closely with the Board of Education and the Norwich Public School System to take every opportunity to incorporate AFVs into school activities. Kids who pre-registered for kindergarten last spring were treated to a ride in a CNG school bus (a preview of the excitement to come on their first official day of school), and the Norwich Planetarium, the only school planetarium in the state, also featured an AFV presentation. Coalition stakeholders made presentations to the Parent Teacher Organizations of every school in the district. With the help of the fire chief, they held training sessions on AFVs and their safety for both parents and students throughout the entire school system to allay fears over the decision to purchase CNG buses for the school system's fleet. ""The educational component of our program is very important,"" said Polubiatko. ""Having the fire chief as our advocate for CNG vehicles really helped increase public acceptance,"" he said. And the fire chief stands behind his word. He not only promotes the safety of CNG vehicles, he also operates them in his fleet. In fact, in addition to the school district (see box below), the fire department, police department, and public works department all operate AFVs. According to Polubiatko, it's that kind of involvement that has been the key to Norwich Clean Cities success. ""My best advice  Not only has the Norwich school system been a centerpiece for the coalition's public education effort, it is the first and only school system in Connecticut to operate alternative fuel buses. The coalition was awarded a 1999 DOE State Energy Program (SEP) grant to help cover the cost of its most recent CNG bus purchase and to help support a vehicle prototype project in partnership with John Deere. Norwich Schools had wanted to convert its entire small bus fleet to CNG, but learned that the conversions were not consistent with Connecticut's Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) standards. In an attempt to tackle this problem head on, Norwich Clean Cities will be working with the local John Deere distributor and the DMV.  12   to coalitions in smaller cities is to keep all of the community involved,"" he said. ""It's all a matter of community inclusion and involvement."" Essential to that level of community involvement and the driving force behind the Norwich Clean Cities effort is the Norwich Department of Public Utilities (NDPU), which was chosen by the city to coordinate the coalition, and hosts its monthly meetings. NDPU provides natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer services to the city, and in addition to operating a fleet of natural gas and electric vehicles (the largest electric utility fleet in the state), owns and operates the only public CNG station in southeastern Connecticut. ""We're looking to add infrastructure,"" said  Polubiatko. The coalition plans to work with the state to help bring state fleet vehicles to Norwich, a move which Polubiatko thinks will help drive further infrastructure development. ""We work very closely with the state. State agencies have been a real asset to our program."" Looking ahead to its fifth anniversary and its renewal of the memorandum of understanding signed at its designation, the coalition plans to keep moving forward, maintaining the enthusiasm for AFVs. Strategic infrastructure development is a top priority, as are fleet recruitment and planning the coalition's Advancing the AFV Choice event. With all the AFV activity in Norwich, Smogzilla may soon be an endangered species.  From the Hill alternative fuel vehicles in high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.  Congress Still Working Hard for Alternative Fuels As predicted in the Alternative Fuel News, Vol. 3, No. 1, West Virginia's U.S. Senator John Rockefeller (D) officially introduced the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act (S1003). The bill was created to ""level the playing field,"" for the various alternative fuels, as well as between alternative and conventional fuel vehicles. According to Rockefeller, ""We can break this [chicken-and-egg] cycle by creating tax incentives that keep alternative fuels affordable and help develop the necessary infrastructure."" The bill allows for the full complement of alternative fuels to compete in the marketplace through limited federal tax incentives that would be available during the early, critical years of market development. Specifically, the legislation would:  Extend the current electric vehicle (EV) tax credit and increase the credit for advanced technology electric vehicles. The current EV tax credit is 10% of the vehicle purchase price, up to $4,000. This bill would extend the sunset date until 2010, and give an additional $5,000 credit to any EV that would meet 100-mile range requirements. This should encourage technological innovation for advanced batteries.  Give a tax deduction (not credit) for the cost of installation of alternative fueling stations, up to $30,000.  Offer a 50-cent a gasoline-gallon-equivalent tax credit to the sellers of clean burning alternative fuels used in alternative fuel vehicles, to help them compete with the price of traditional fuels. This would allow alternative fuels to become more economically favorable to the consumer. Clean burning alternative fuels include: compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and any liquid made of at least 85% methanol.  Provide states the authority to allow single occupant,  Rockefeller stated, ""Tax incentives have traditionally been very effective in developing new infrastructure, and encouraging consumers to try new things. While changing consumers' behavior is not easy, I am confident that if people begin to see that alternative fuels are available, they will soon begin to use them."" U.S. Representative Dave Camp (R-MI) introduced similar alternative fuel tax credit legislation (HR 2252). The bill is virtually identical to the Rockefeller legislation, except for the provision regarding alternative fuel vehicles in HOV lanes. Regarding the bill, Rep. Camp said, ""It improves air quality, and by increasing the use of alternative fuels, it decreases our reliance on foreign oil."" Currently, HR 2252 has 18 co-sponsors, which demonstrates support for alternative fuels tax measures. Also, it is expected that Senator John Chafee (R-RI) will introduce another alternative fuel tax credit bill shortly. This proposal will provide a seller 's fuel tax credit of 25 cents for each gasoline-gallon-equivalent of alternative fuel sold in non-attainment areas; and a purchaser 's vehicle tax credit to defray the incremental cost of an alternative fuel vehicle. The vehicle credit, which will apply to light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, is tiered; cleaner vehicles receive larger credits. During the Senate floor debate on the tax bill, a colloquy took place among Senators Chafee, Hatch (R-UT) and William Roth (R-DE). In the colloquy, Roth, Chairman of the Finance Committee, agreed to work with Senators Chafee and Hatch to include an alternative fuel tax credit measure in a future tax package. Prospects for a tax package in FY2000 are now dimming. Stay tuned for more information on the Chafee legislation and prospects for tax incentives next year.

DOE's Brian Castelli, Chief of Staff for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, joined Tucson Mayor George Miller in signing a coalition's Memorandum of Understanding, officially designating the coalition. Stakeholders currently operate more than 580 AFVs, including CNG, propane, and electric vehicles, and have committed to additional vehicle purchases over the next 4 years that will add nearly 1,000 AFVs to the road by 2003. The Tucson coalition is coordinated by the Pima Association of Governments, and serves Tucson, as well as Pima County. The coalition maintains a diversity of stakeholders: utilities; local and federal governments (including an Air Force base); universities; and several niche market fleets, which encompass a transit bus company and local landscaping group. #74  Northeast Ohio Northeast Ohio became the 74th member of the Clean Cities Program on Tuesday, September 14. DOE's David Leiter, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, made his debut as a designating official at the ceremony, which was held at the Great Lakes Science Center in downtown Cleveland. The Northeast Ohio Clean Cities Coalition serves the city of Cleveland and the surrounding area, including Cuyahoga, Lorain, Summit, Medina, Portage, Geauga, Lake, and Ashtabula counties. More than 1,400 AFVs already operate throughout Northeast Ohio, and Clean Cities stakeholders plan to have more than 1,700 on the road by the year 2004.

Alternative Fuels Turn Vogue The New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) created an exhibition to examine a new generation of cars: alternative fuel vehicles. The intention of the exhibit ""Different Roads: Automobiles for the Next Century,"" is to survey the current generation of automobiles and outline different paths to the future. The exhibit illustrates the scope and direction of the  rethinking in automotive design, and notes that AFVs ""represent an important and growing aspect of the market that caters to a consumer who is more attentive to thrift, and thus more attracted to the improved economy of these vehicles."" The exhibit examines new power plants and fuels, such as electric and hybrid engines that allow for a more fuel-efficient car. The New Structures and New Materials covered by the exhibit include DaimlerChrysler 's MCC Smart and CCV, Audi's AL2, Ford's Ka, and BMW/Rover Group Mini concept car. The Power Plants displayed include the Fiat Multipia, GM EV1, Honda VV (now called the Insight), and Toyota Prius. A forum created on the Web site allows the public to  14   At the Pump Biodiesel ""B20"" Workshops Held Across the Country In the wake of recently passed Energy Policy Act (EPAct) legislation, a series of biodiesel workshops were held across the country to increase awareness of biodiesel as a transportation fuel. More specifically, the workshops were geared toward educating people about biodiesel and the new option of using biodiesel to fulfill AFV acquisition requirements under EPAct. ""The original goal of the workshop was to expand the public's awareness of biodiesel through education and outreach. After the [EPAct] legislation passed, the National Biodiesel Board and NREL [National Renewable Energy Laboratory] agreed to join resources to expand the scope and number of workshops,"" said Shaine Tyson, NREL's Biodiesel Project Manager. Sponsors of the workshops included the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), NREL, the National Biodiesel Board, and various local partnerships. The workshops took place in five cities across the country from May to September this year. The cities included Bloomington, Minnesota; College Park, Maryland; Diamond Bar, California; Warwick, Rhode Island; and Chicago, Illinois. ""The target audience included all the groups that potentially have an impact on a fleet's decision to use alternative fuels. That can include federal, state, and local fleet managers and administrators, air quality regulators, city managers, etc.,"" Tyson explained. The free workshops provided a wide array of information on biodiesel, such as characteristics and properties of the fuel, contracting and purchasing issues, and issues fleet managers should consider when evaluating it for their fleets. Tyson also noted that ""the workshops have expanded competition in the biodiesel market as well."" Cincinnati, Ohio transit bus powered by soy diesel  ""The workshops have been successful in airing issues regarding biodiesel. They have been a conduit for answering questions regarding biodiesel, which is important due to recent attention given to biodiesel blends regarding EPAct legislation,"" said Mike Voorhies, manager, Regional Biomass Energy Program, Department of Energy. The EPAct regulation that has renewed attention to biodiesel is the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Interim Final Rule issued by DOE in May. The Final Rule allows fleets required to purchase certain percentages of AFVs under EPAct to meet up to 50% of their acquisition requirements through the use of biodiesel blends, such as B20, in vehicles weighing 8,500 lbs. gross vehicle weight or greater. B20 is a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel. With the new option, a fleet can get credit for one AFV purchase by using 450 gallons of 100% biodiesel. Joe Jobe, Executive Director of the National Biodiesel Board, was very pleased with the turnout at the workshops. ""The feedback and response we received was great. We utilized survey forms to fine tune the workshops and make information more in-line with what the participants wanted."" Although sponsors would like to continue with more workshops, no more are scheduled at this time. To learn more about biodiesel, visit the National Biodiesel Board Web site at http://www.biodiesel.org. The Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule can be found on their Web site at http://www.biodiesel.org/fueluselang.htm  comment on various topics related to the vehicles, such as ""Would you change your big car (SUV) for one of the cars in the exhibition?"" The comments submitted via the interactive Web site will be forwarded to the auto manufacturers. According to the exhibit's assistant curator in the Department of Architecture and Design, Christopher Mount, ""The show is really about efficient, responsible automobiles being likeable, appealing, and charming in their own way. In a sense, a good design can be affordable."" This exhibit was the first automobile exhibition to be held in the Sculpture Garden since the landmark exhibition, Ten Automobiles, in 1952. An indoor gallery space with explanatory text and  computer terminals was also available for the public to view the Web site. The Web site was created especially for the exhibit, and allows the public to gain a better understanding of the complex technology behind the design of these automobiles. The site provides photos and automotive information, including vehicle dimensions, construction, speed, engine type, etc. Internet links are also provided to many different locations to find new power plants and fuels, new materials, new structures and designs, and federal government agencies (which, of course, includes DOE).

Stakeholders and partners in cities across the country have done much to ensure that alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are available and the refueling and maintenance infrastructure is in place to support AFV use. Coalition members continue to reach out to local fleets, providing information about alternative fuel options and facilitating the AFV choice. The growing number of fleets using AFVs fosters the continued development of alternative refueling infrastructure, such that in many cities, fleets can now make a relatively seamless transition to alternative fuels. Individual Clean Cities serve as centers of AFV activity, but what happens when business stretches beyond those ""City Limits"" signs? For many fleets, business is not limited to a particular city. Delivery service vehicles may have multiple stops in several cities within a region. Airports frequently service many metropolitan areas; shuttle customers need transportation to or from the airport to neighboring towns. So how does Clean Cities facilitate travel between various Clean Cities? Many coalitions now work together to identify those fleets that use the interstate highways, so they can seek funding for shared refueling infrastructure projects along routes and further develop corridor links. Using Clean Cities as hubs, clean corridors can be created by enabling interstate and regional AFV travel to use a shared alternative fuel infrastructure. Clean corridors permit fleets that serve multiple cities to purchase AFVs with confidence, knowing that fueling convenience and supply will not be a problem. One of the most successful corridors to date is the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC). Coordinated by Clean Cities consultants at Gladstein & Associates, the ICTC connects multiple Clean Cities in the West, including Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco in California; and Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. The ICTC focuses primarily on the commercial trucking industry, targeting heavy-duty truck fleets that use Interstate Highways 80, 5, 10, and 15, and CA-99, and promoting liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to diesel fuel. Over the past several years, the ICTC has been successful in offsetting the incremental costs for LNG trucks throughout the region and in developing a network of refueling stations along the highways that make up the corridor.  3   The ICTC has received considerable acclaim. When faced with the challenge of mitigating the environmental impacts of increased border traffic due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Texas General Land Office (GLO) looked to the ICTC as a model for clean corridor development. NAFTA relies heavily on trade routes between the United States and its neighbors, Mexico and Canada. These routes have dramatically increased the volume of traffic--particularly heavy-duty truck traffic--along the highways connecting the three countries. The increase of heavy-duty trucks has brought goods and also higher levels of emissions and air pollution. The GLO recognized the air quality impact NAFTA traffic was having on the state (which includes major border crossing points for trucks transporting goods to and from Mexico), and looked to alternative fuel use as a solution. The GLO began working with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Lone Star Energy's alternative fuels division, the U. S. Postal Service, local Clean Cities Coalitions, and the Environmental Protection Agency to identify opportunities to reduce emissions through the use of natural gas. Through this partnership, and working in conjunction with Gladstein & Associates, the International Clean Transportation Corridor-3 (ICTC-3) was born. ""The marriage of the Land Office corridor effort and the ICTC was a good one,"" said Elizabeth Munger, Director of the ICTC-3. ""We learned from the ICTC effort and took advantage of their experience."" The ICTC-3 serves all three countries (hence the name ICTC-3) and focuses specifically on the cities intersected by north-south routes I-35 and I-29, and eventually I-94 (see map). The long term goals for the corridor include linking I-35 with east-west route I-10, enabling AFV travel from Houston, Texas, to Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. Connections with I-40, and the cities of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are also in the long term plan. When this effort is finished, the new corridor will link the ICTC-3 with its ""sister"" corridor in the west, the ICTC. But for now, according to Munger, the primary objective of the ICTC-3 is education and outreach. ""We are facilitating a two-way exchange of information, so everyone involved knows what's going on in the cities along the corridor and can take advantage of the opportunities to work together,"" she said. The group, which includes Clean Cities coordinators and stakeholders from the Laredo, Houston, Alamo Area, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Omaha, Red River Valley, and Winnipeg coalitions, meets regularly to discuss their current projects and progress. Clean Cities members are currently focusing their corridor efforts to strengthen their locales as hubs for mediumand heavy-duty vehicles. They are partnering on refueling infrastructure development projects and working to identify target fleets along corridor routes. ""The Clean Cities Program is the backbone of this effort,"" said Munger. ""So far, in each of the participating cities, a well-developed infrastructure for light-duty vehicles is beginning, but  Manitoba  CANADA  Winnipeg  North Dakota 94 29  Grand Forks  South Dakota  Minnesota  Nebraska 29  Iowa  Kansas  35  Kansas City Missouri  Oklahoma  Tulsa Oklahoma City  Arkansas  35  Ft.

With ready access to major transportation routes, Monterrey is home to a large number of U.S.-operated plants, U.S. companies, and local companies, all of which depend on trucks to transport their goods. The purpose of the trade mission, which is sponsored by DOE, is to promote U.S. alternative fuel technologies to medium- and heavy-duty truck fleets. For more information, call Elizabeth Munger, Director, ICTC-3, at 512-447-3595, or e-mail her at elizabeth@gladstein.org. PDNCCC/PIX 06149  there hasn't been much of a concerted effort on the nonmandated vehicles. If we can strengthen the hubs, we can connect them with stations in between and build a corridor to support increased medium- and heavy-duty AFV traffic,"" she said. The corridor partnerships have sparked new ideas and facilitated progress in many corridor hubs. According to coordinator Benjamin Watson, the Kansas City Regional Clean Cities Coalition (KCRCCC) reaped great benefits from the information exchange among the corridor cities. ""Last year we replicated work that was done in Oklahoma and were successful in getting alternative fuels legislation in Kansas and Missouri. This year we will be replicating the Dallas rebate project,"" he said. The ICTC-3 also serves as the alternative fuels working group of North America's Superhighway Coalition (NASCO), an advocacy group promoting Interstate Highways 35, 29, and 94 as North America's International Trade Corridor. NASCO works to leverage funding to improve the highways and their infrastructure, and to add critical technologies along the corridor to facilitate trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Part of NASCO's mission is to mitigate the environmental impact of the increasing truck traffic along the highways as a result of NAFTA. In her role as director of the ICTC-3 and chair of the alternative fuels working group, Munger shares corridor project progress and success stories with NASCO. ""The most important thing we do is disperse information and help educate NASCO and the fleets that use the corridor, by showing them that alternative fuels are a real option, which provide both economic and environmental benefits,"" she said. As more partnerships develop among Clean Cities coalitions, the network of alternative fuel infrastructure will expand. Clean corridors are making regional AFV travel a reality, and under the leadership of members from the ICTC, ICTC-3, and other corridor efforts, a closely knit national AFV network is on the way. For more information on clean corridors, please call the Clean Cities Hotline at 1-800-CCITIES.  Trucks waiting in line at a U.S./Mexico border crossing.  The ICTC corridor family is an example of a handful of corridor efforts, each in a different stage of development. The Northeast Corridor runs along the East Coast, connecting Richmond, Virginia, with Boston, Massachusetts, along I-95. The I-79 Corridor connects Charleston, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Clean Crossroads effort links several Midwestern Clean Cities, including Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana. The Colorado Front Range Corridor is another formalized effort among the Denver, Weld/Larimer/Rocky Mountain National Park, and Colorado Springs Clean Cities Coalitions, which is also working to connect with Clean Cities in Kansas and Missouri along I-70. The Northwest Corridor serves I-5, connecting the Rogue Valley Clean Cities Coalition in Oregon with the Puget Sound Coalition based in Seattle, Washington. It extends north into Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The I-90 Corridor links several New York Clean Cities Coalitions, including Western New York, Genesee Region, Central New York, and Capital District.  5   Federal News DOE Supports USPS Commitments to Electric Vehicles The United States Postal Service (USPS) recently ordered 500 electric delivery vehicles--the single largest purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) in U. S. history. Purchased through a competitive bid process from the Ford Motor Company, production will begin this fall. The vehicles will be assembled in Rome, New York. California will receive 480 of the vehicles, and the remainder will be located in Maryland. ""The acquisition of these new vehicles once again reminds us of the pioneering role the Postal Service has played for over 200 years, utilizing innovation and technology in binding the nation together. Adopting this world-class technology benefits the Postal Service and the American people,"" said Postmaster General William J. Henderson. ""We deliver clean air along with the nation's mail. We're proud to be a good, environmental neighbor in every community we serve.""  USPS Long Life Vehicle on display at the Clean Cities Conference in Louisville, Kentucky.  acid battery-powered EVs can be driven between 50 and 80 pollution-free miles before recharging. Acceleration is similar to their gasoline-powered counterparts, with the ability to go from 0-50 mph in 12.5 seconds. The deployment of the first 500 vehicles will mean an annual reduction in tailpipe emissions of nearly 143,000 pounds of carbon monoxide, 11,000 pounds of hydrocarbons, and 16,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides. Since these vehicles run virtually pollution-free, the 500 vehicles, with an average of 500 deliveries per route, add up to more than a quarter million of pollution-free deliveries per day. The USPS currently has the nation's largest compressed natural gas delivery fleet, with more than 7,500 vehicles. It recently purchased more than 21,000 flexible-fuel vehicles, which run on either gasoline or ethanol. By 2002, the USPS fleet of AFVs is expected to exceed 30,000. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson offered his congratulations to the Postal Service, saying the acquisition is ""... a watershed for the use of electric vehicles in the United States.""  . . .these vehicles cost the USPS no more than the gasoline vehicles the USPS normally employs. Thanks to partnering efforts with the U. S. Department of Energy, the states of California and New York, the California Energy Commission, and several other environmental groups, these vehicles cost the USPS no more than the gasoline vehicles the USPS normally employs. The lead  GAO Releases ""Glass Half-empty"" Transit Bus Report In December 1999, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the status of alternative fuel use in transit bus fleets across the country. The report, which was mandated by the Transportation Equity Act of 1998 (TEA), was to review the types of alternative fuel bus technologies now in service and discuss the environmental and economic implications of their use. A casual reader of the GAO report would conclude that alternative fuel buses are costly and not worth the effort. This is looking at the glass as ""half empty."" The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and many transit agencies look at the same data in a more positive light. With many of the early technical problems now solved, natural gas and other alternative fuel buses have a promising future.  6  John Nation/PIX 07873   The report contains some useful information and data within its charts and appendices; however, most of the discussion material is loosely based on informal conversations and interviews that the GAO had with a small industry group. Staff from only 12 transit agencies (out of hundreds in the country) were interviewed, and some of those agencies had only a few alternative fuel buses in their fleet (see table below). The GAO cited no specific scientific studies or in-depth analyses as the basis of the report, saying only that they had reviewed information from a variety of sources. Not surprisingly, the report reveals that natural gas buses make up the majority of alternative fuel buses now in operation. Despite extensive communication with DOE and other industry groups, the report discloses little recent information. It also fails to address several critical issues that now drive the increased demand for alternative fuel buses. Much of the report dwells on poor fleet experiences with early generation equipment from the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the findings do not reflect current market conditions. Despite the ""glass half empty"" write up, an overview of the report's charts and appendices does show some positive alternative fuel trends that were not revealed in the GAO findings (see box at right). Most of the people interviewed for this report believe that environmental concerns are the main reason more alternative fuel buses are being used; the report states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ""receives  more complaints from the public about emissions from transit buses than all other environmental issues combined."" Furthermore, the report claims that diesel buses have become significantly cleaner over the past 11 years, based on progressive tightening of emissions standards over that same period.  Alternative Fuel Trends  The number of new alternative fuel transit buses being purchased by agencies across the country continues to grow. Nearly 20% of all new bus orders are now alternative fuel vehicles (primarily natural gas).  Half of all the agencies contacted by the GAO plan to continue buying alternative fuel buses; of those, all but one are buying 100% alternative fuel buses (i.e., not ordering any diesel buses).  Half of the CNG transit operators that were interviewed reported their fuel costs for CNG were equal to or less than their diesel costs would have been for the same period. (Note that this was before the steady price increases that diesel and gasoline are experiencing.) No mention was made of the anticipated price increases for low-sulfur diesel fuel necessary to achieve future emissions reductions in diesel engines.

The subsequent consent decree settlement (more than a billion dollars) clearly demonstrates that the engines on the road did not meet the published standards. According to an EPA spokesperson, ""The seven companies sold 1.3 million heavy-duty diesel engines containing illegal `defeat devices,' which allow an engine to pass the EPA emissions test, but then turn off emission controls during highway driving. As a result, these engines emit up to three times the current (allowable) level for NOx, a harmful air pollutant."" These heavy-duty diesel engines emitted 1.3 million tons of excess NOx in 1998 alone, equivalent to the NOx emissions from an additional 65 million cars being on the road, and representing 6% of the total NOx emissions across the nation.  In addition, the report makes no mention of numerous recent studies and scientific findings concerning the health effects of exposure to diesel particulate matter. Such exposure is often worse in communities that rely heavily on public transit. Nor does the report address the impact that new regulations currently under consideration in California could have on the demand for alternative fuel buses. On the capital expenditure side, there is no question that alternative fuel buses continue to carry a premium. However, based on the large number of new orders for natural gas buses, many transit agencies and their local communities apparently believe that the added expense is justified by the environmental and societal benefits that the alternative fuel buses offer. Check out www.afdc.doe.gov/afv/buses.html for the latest documentation on alternative fuel buses.  DOE Makes Progress with State and Fuel Provider Enforcement The State and Fuel Provider (S&FP) regulation went into effect in April 1996 (effective with the 1997 reporting year), in accordance with the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Under this program, which is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), state fleets and alternative fuel provider fleets are mandated to acquire a specific percentage of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as part of their regular annual light-duty vehicle acquisitions. The S&FP Program requires fleets to report on the number of light-duty vehicle and AFV acquisitions for the year. Fleets earn credits for AFVs acquired in excess of their requirements, which can then be traded or sold to other fleets that were unable to meet their requirements through AFV purchases. This process provides key flexibility in the program and promotes both AFVs and sound business practices. For model year between 50% and tions are required depending on the 2000, which began September 1, 1999, 90% of new light-duty vehicle acquisito be AFVs (the percentages vary type of fleet). EPAct that do not comply with the S&FP regulation are subject to fines violation per day. As of January 2000, fleets had complied.  Pictured in front of the Minnesota State Capitol Building are Wally Lysle and Jan Reak with a Ford Taurus FFV, part of a fleet used by the Minnesota Department of Public Service.  Fleets covered by requirements of the of up to $50,000 per almost 90% of these  from sedans and pickup trucks, to vans and minivans. Furthermore, due in part to this program, more refueling sites are available nationwide for fuels such as ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These options provide AFV users more flexibility and freedom. For example, ethanol stations have increased from two nationwide in 1992 to 49 in 1999. The network of CNG stations has grown from 349 to 1,267, and LPG refueling stations have increased from 3,297 to 4,153 over the same period. Since the regulation passed, DOE's program team has spent most of its time organizing the implementation. Now that procedures and processes are in place, it will focus on increased outreach and enforcement. For more information regarding the S&FP Program, log on to the Alternative Fuel Data Center Web site at www.afdc.doe.gov/fleet.html, call the regulatory information line at 202-586-9171, or send an e-mail to regulatory_info@afdc.nrel.gov.  Fleets reporting to DOE now have more than 35,000 AFVs on the road, with annual demand of at least 6,500 AFVs. Dana O'Hara, DOE's EPAct Team Leader, has high hopes for the program. ""We expect the number of AFVs in state and fuel provider fleets to keep increasing, in part because our enforcement strategy is flexible and fair,"" he said. Today more than 30 different models of AFVs are available from original equipment manufacturers, ranging  8  Warren Gretz, NREL/PIX 05039   Focus On Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  AFN Focus on the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  SLCCC has niche market projects (including several 100% alternative fuel fleets), airport initiatives, a technical training program, a renowned legislative effort, and a recognized public outreach program. The coalition recently received non-profit status. How do they do it all? Miller says it's a combination of the right environment and stakeholder support that helps make it happen in Salt Lake City. ""Ultimately, every Clean Cities coalition is concerned with increasing the number of AFVs on the road and adding more refueling infrastructure,"" she added. ""We are fortunate to have wonderful fleets and strong support from our stakeholders."" In addition to tactical project support, the Utah Office of Energy Services has made the full-time coordinator position possible through funding support, and the Salt Lake City Mayor 's office provides Miller with a workplace and other amenities, including a computer, phone, and mailing services. ""The availability of a full-time coordinator has been a vital element to their success,"" said DOE's Ernie Oakes, Clean Cities Program Manager for the Denver Region. Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition successes include more than 2,230 AFVs, already surpassing their original program plan goal for 2000. Many of these vehicles operate in niche market fleets that are highly visible to the community. The Newspaper Agency, responsible for delivering the area's two major newspapers--the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News--is a classic example of a successful niche market AFV fleet. According to Miller, after researching its options, The Newspaper Agency staff decided AFVs would be a good way to give something back to the community. Today it operates a nearly 100% alternative fuel  Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  Increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on the road and developing a network of refueling sites to support their use is no mean feat. It requires well-rounded coalitions that are effective in all aspects of the Clean Cities arena, including public outreach, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and legislative advocacy. Any of these tasks may seem formidable, but the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition (SLCCC) and coordinator Beverly Miller makes it all look easy.

All 230 of its vans, which travel six million miles a year, run on CNG and are saving the company thousands of dollars in fuel costs. ""The Newspaper Agency is absolutely committed,"" said Miller. ""It's their passion for alternative fuels that has made them so successful."" Another delivery fleet, Flower Patch, Inc., a floral delivery service, is also operating its entire fleet (18 vehicles) on natural gas. The Jordan School District added seven natural gas buses in 1999, bringing its total AFV fleet to almost 30. The city-owned airport, whose fleet includes many heavy-duty snow removal vehicles and buses, is 26% alternative fueled, and that percentage is steadily climbing. The coalition, which intends to make Salt Lake International Airport ""the greenest airport in the country,"" has developed an AFV strategic plan to be implemented this year. SLCCC is also working with independently owned shuttle companies that service the airport to facilitate their transition to alternative fuels. Among the stakeholders at the helm of SLCCC's niche market effort is a local vehicle dealership. A representative from Hinckley Dodge is working with several area shuttles that serve handicapped and disabled people to transition their vehicles to AFVs. ""It's been the most focused and  9   The thousands of AFVs traveling the area's roads would not be possible, however, without the strong support of fuel providers like Utah's Questar Gas. Miller calls Questar Gas ""simply fantastic."" Not only does its fleet include more than 800 AFVs, but the company has also helped develop an extensive refueling infrastructure network that includes more than 60 natural gas stations. In partnership with the state of Utah, most of the region's refueling sites are now publicly accessible with a common gas credit card. ""GasCard expanded the number of publicly accessible sites from 20 to 32,"" said Miller. ""The stations are easily accessible and near interstate highways, which helps create an environment attractive to fleets,"" she said.

Pictured (left to right, top): Beverly Miller, Ellen Stone, and Robin Erickson; (left to right, bottom): Gordon Larsen, John Bennett, Wendell Combs, Lynne Nichols, Jim Brande, Jim Jeffries, and Richard Valentine.  The coalition, which recently received non-profit status, also assists area fleets with fund-raising to support AFV purchases. Last year, SLCCC was awarded three DOE State Energy Program Special Projects grants totaling $314,421. The funds will support the school bus fleet, a delivery fleet, and a publicly accessible refueling station at the airport. The coalition also received $25,000 through DOE's Clean Cities Rebate Program to create an AFV reimbursement fund for coalition stakeholders. The Propane Education and Research Council also awarded the coalition a grant to support The Newspaper Agency's purchase. SLCCC is active in public outreach as well. The Newspaper Agency, which co-chairs the coalition's public awareness committee, helped develop several projects. In partnership with the National Energy Foundation, they created two newspaper supplements. The first insert was a resource guide with information on alternative fuels and Clean Cities for the elementary and middle school students participating in Utah's ninth annual energy debate. More than 375,000 copies were printed; half were distributed to schools in response to specific requests. The second newspaper insert corresponded to the opening of TRAX, the area's new light rail system, and featured information on alternative transportation systems, as well as the Clean Cities Program. The coalition is currently planning a third supplement on land use issues, which will highlight AFVs and transportation planning. Also included in Salt Lake's outreach activities is its technician-training program. The coalition developed a program that is offered without charge to technicians representing local entities with AFVs. It might seem the vehicle, station, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and public outreach activities would be enough to keep the Salt Lake coalition busy. However,  Miller and other stakeholders have also developed a legislative plan. ""I feel strongly about the importance of people directly involving themselves in the political process,"" said Miller. ""There isn't anything more American than calling your legislator and voicing your opinion."" The coalition has developed a relationship with local and national legislators and regularly informs them of its activities and successes. While in Washington, D.C., at the Fourth National Clean Cities Conference, Miller and several other SLCCC stakeholders made a trip to Capitol Hill and visited with staff members of every congressional representative for the state of Utah. ""It's important to work with the staff,"" said Miller. ""They can help you, or they can shut you out."" Perhaps it is no coincidence that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was a cosponsor of The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act (S. 1003), introduced in 1999, and has announced his support for alternative fuels in numerous forums. Utah legislators are also helping the SLCCC. As a result of the relationships SLCCC stakeholders have developed, staffers now seek their opinion. ""Voters don't typically make phone calls, but when you make yourself known, others will follow,"" Miller said. The coalition's legislative momentum will continue through the 2000 legislative session. Stakeholders have drafted AFV legislation they hope will be introduced. In the spirit of what Miller calls ""grassroots advocacy,"" several private sector coalition members are working with a lobbyist to help them with the information--and the courage--they need to call their elected officials and put in a good word. According to Miller, effective outreach and constant customer interaction help create a favorable environment for AFVs. ""If you do something long enough, if you have a constant presence and never forget your message, you'll begin to see some activity,"" she said. A strong core of support is also essential for success. ""I really believe this is a full-time job,"" said Miller. ""At the least, you have to get people involved. I am deeply indebted to about a halfdozen, results-oriented people. You don't need many, but with a core group you can really make things  10  Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition  most aggressive effort I've ever seen,"" said Miller.   happen...just find two or three things that you can feel good about so you can advertise your success,"" she said. The SLCCC Board of Trustees meets regularly, as do most of the coalition's working groups. In addition to stakeholder involvement, remembering ""the basics"" is also critical to maintaining coalition support. ""It's also important to thank people,"" Miller added. ""You  have to bring people in, make them feel good about what they're doing, and let them know you appreciate their efforts."" Salt Lake Clean Cities continues to be a leader in all aspects of alternative fuel market development. Thank you, Beverly Miller and the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition, for setting an outstanding example.  Clean Cities Roundup Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition Celebrates Purchase of 40 AFVs Before kicking off its millennium festivities, the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition (GLICCC) hosted a different kind of celebration. Together with the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Boston Regional Office, coalition stakeholders, including KeySpan Energy, DOE's Clean Cities Program, Suffolk County, and Ford Motor Company, celebrated the purchase of 40 natural gas vehicles by Arrow Security, a private security firm based on Long Island. The purchase, recognized as the largest single acquisition of natural gas vehicles by a private fleet in New York state, was made possible by funding and technical assistance from the GLICCC, KeySpan Energy, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and the DOE Clean Cities Rebate program. GLICCC and KeySpan Energy leveraged $275,000 in public and private financing to help offset the capital costs of the project. For more information, call Mike Scarpino, U.S. DOE, Boston Regional Office, at 617-565-9716.

Connecticut Subway Restaurants Now Offer More than Just Sandwiches Now many Connecticut residents can do more than get a sandwich and chips at the local Subway. The Subway shops of Fairfield County have committed to a partnership with Clean Cities Energy Alternatives of Southwestern Connecticut (formerly Norwalk Clean Cities). Subway has positioned itself as the ""Smart Alternative,"" to fast food, a strategy that the company sees as a perfect fit with the local Clean Cities effort.  In the spirit of healthy living, Subway management has offered its locations as designated sign-up spots for individuals or companies. People who are interested in joining the local Clean Cities coalition can sign up while they lunch at a Fairfield County Subway shop, using coalition membership applications that are available at each cash register. In turn, Subway will have an ad on the application directing companies and /or individuals to the coalition's Web site www.pls.org/ccea.htm. Visitors to the Web site can download a coupon for Subway sandwiches, which is valid at a participating store in the Fairfield County area. Depending on the success of the pilot program, local board chairman James Hansen will present the idea to Subway's national board to implement nationwide.  11   From the Automakers Wieck Photo Database  Auto Show Attendees Get a Glimpse of Future Concept Cars Winter isn't only a season of cold weather, snow, and holiday fun. For many in the transportation industry, it's also the auto show season. In Tokyo and Detroit, automakers impressed audiences, who were anxious to catch a glimpse of the vehicles for the new millennium. Hybrid electric and fuel cell concept vehicles drew much of the attention, as environmentally friendly transportation is a growing concern among consumers. Ford and General Motors (GM) unveiled their hybrid vehicles developed with the help of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). The new energy efficient hybrids, still under development, boast fuel economies of 80, 90, and even 100 miles per gallon (mpg). Below are a few of the vehicles showcased last fall in Tokyo and at the North American International Auto Show held in January 2000. Although most are still concepts and do not compete directly with today's alternative fuel vehicles, these hybrid-electric and fuel cell technologies forecast an exciting future for drivers everywhere.  Ford Prodigy On the outside, the Ford Prodigy looks very similar to the conventional model year 2000 vehicles. What's on the inside, however, is a much different story. The Prodigy, a hybrid-electric concept vehicle designed to be a family sedan, uses a propulsion system with drive units on both axles. An experimental four-cylinder, 1.2 liter diesel engine, and an electric drive motor enable fuel economy of 80 mpg with diesel fuel (the equivalent of 70 mpg in a gasoline vehicle). Made almost entirely of aluminum, the Prodigy is extremely light and aerodynamic; rear-facing cameras replace traditional side view mirrors to reduce drag. But even though Ford uses the latest technology, it has not lost its focus on practicality. Unlike many other hybrid-electric concepts, the Prodigy has a usable trunk.  Honda Insight and FCX Honda's hybrid-electric Insight needed no introduction, as it was among the first hybrid vehicles to be officially unveiled last year (and it was also showcased at the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in June 1999). In addition to highlighting the Insight, Honda unveiled its latest advanced technology concept vehicle, the FCX, at the auto show in Detroit. The FCX is a fuel cell prototype sedan that Honda plans to have on the road by 2003. The prototype models include both hydrogen- and methanolbased systems.  Pictured top to bottom: Ford Prodigy, hybrid-electric concept vehicle; Honda Insight, hybrid-electric vehicle already in production; Honda FCX, fuel cell prototype vehicle.  12  Wieck Photo Database  American Honda Motor Company/PIX 07324   GM's Precept and Chevrolet Triax Wieck Photo Database Wieck Photo Database Toyota Motor Sales  General Motors (GM) is also working on two new hybrid concepts--the GM Precept and the Chevrolet Triax. The Precept is among the world's most energy efficient vehicles; it can attain 90 miles per diesel gallon (80 mpg gasoline) equivalent. GM unveiled the sleek, aerodynamic hybrid-electric concept vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Precept features a dual-axle regenerative hybrid propulsion system that combines electric and either gasoline or diesel engine systems. The fuel cell version of the Precept also made its debut in Detroit. It uses a hydrogen hydride storage system, which GM boasts will attain 108-mpg equivalent and up to 500 miles in range. The Chevrolet Triax, featured at the Tokyo and North American International Auto Shows, is a sharply angled and highly versatile hybrid vehicle that can be produced with one of three powertrains--4WD electric, 2WD gasoline, or 4WD gasoline-electric hybrid. Customers will be able to select the type of powertrain that best meets their needs. In its hybrid form, the Triax has an electric motor that powers the front wheels and captures regenerative braking energy to recharge the battery. A gasoline engine drives the rear wheels, and a second electric motor captures the regenerative braking energy from the rear wheels and starts the engine.  Toyota's HV-M4 Although Toyota showcased its highly popular hybrid, the Prius, in Detroit, the company unveiled its newest hybrid concept vehicle--the HV-M4-- at the Tokyo Auto Show last fall. The HV-M4, the world's first hybrid-electric 4WD minivan, is powered by a 2.4 liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the back wheels. The HV-M4 is reported to meet Japan's soon-to-be toughest emissions standards, J-ULEV. With room for six and its own mobile power station (internal and external electric sockets that can power a microwave or television without extra charging), the HV-M4 will be an exciting entry into the hybrid world. Look for coverage of DaimlerChrysler's new hybrid, the Dodge ESX3, in upcoming issues of AFN.

These awards are the first for the Green Energy Parks Program. Thirty-three national parks will benefit from the grants, made possible through DOE funds. The money will support the enhanced use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in the National Park System. Anticipated projects include building new refueling stations, buying more AFVs, and evaluating emerging engine and fuel system technologies for use in the parks. The Green Energy Parks Program continues this year, with another round of project developments already under way. Check out www.doe.gov/news/releases99/decpr/ pr99319.htm for information about the types of AFVs and fuels being used in the National Park System.  NAFTC Names New Executive Director The National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) recently announced the appointment of Al Ebron as its new executive director. Ebron, formerly Alternative Fuels Program Manager for the state of North Carolina, brings extensive experience in alternative fuels to this position at NAFTC. The consortium, headquartered in Morgantown, West Virginia at West Virginia University, is the nation's leading supplier of alternative fuels systems training and education.

S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Technology Utilization has recently issued the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) Section 506 report. The report evaluates progress made in achieving the fuel displacement goals described in EPAct, the actual and potential role of replacement fuels and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in significantly reducing U.S. reliance on imported oil, and the actual and potential availability of various domestic replacement fuels and AFVs. The considerable experience gained from vehicle operation that was mandated by EPAct and related DOE research and development efforts helped determine the following conclusions about transportation replacement fuels:  The technical barriers to the use of alternative and replacement fuels can be overcome.  Many people who own vehicles find the performance of flexible and alternative fuel vehicles acceptable.  The 10/30 replacement fuel goals cannot be met, given today's petroleum product prices and the limited federal authority to promote or require the use of replacement fuels. DOE, as part of its EPAct rulemaking to determine if private and local fleets should be required to purchase AFVs, will determine whether the goals should be modified, given the current market conditions.  The public policy goals served by the increased use of alternative and replacement fuels remain strong in terms of reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil price shocks, decreasing emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing criteria pollutants, and promoting the development of the domestic economy.  It would be prudent for DOE and interested committees of Congress to begin discussions now on additional programs and authorities that would contribute to reaching EPAct goals. The report, entitled ""Replacement Fuel and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Technical and Policy Analysis,"" was finalized in April 2000 and transmitted to the President and Congress. Copies of the report can be viewed and printed from the ""Regulations and Legislative Activities"" section of DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies Web site at www.ott.doe.gov as soon as it is available. Printed copies will also be available by calling the Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1363.  On the Web Information about Alternatives The Natural Resources Defense Council recently launched a Web site intended to educate the public about alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Once educated, the council hopes more people will make the change to environmentally friendly cars. Visit the Web site www.nrdc.org/. The site www.edf.org/pubs/EDFLetter/1999/ Dec/h_green.html offers information about how to save money, energy, and clean air. This site is also linked through the government site www.fueleconomy.gov.  Ford's Envirodrive www.fordenvirodrive.com Ford Motor Company has a new Web site for its environmentally concerned customers. Unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show, www.fordenvirodrive.com offers the latest information on U.S. fuel economy, emission certification, and manufacturing plant environmental standards information, as well as a glossary of terms. The site also features ""E-labeling,"" which allows visitors to learn about the fuel economy, emissions, and recyclability of various Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury models.

It's an ambitious goal, but coalitions have a variety of new tools, services, and behind-the-scenes support mechanisms to help. Washington Day 2001 provided a forum for Clean Cities staff and industry partners to discuss strategies to achieve the three Clean Cities goals, as well as future plans. The strategies are grouped into five main program areas: 1. 2. 3. 4. Strong existing coalitions, Self-sustaining niche markets, Increased funding for AFV and infrastructure projects, Legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development, 5. Mandates and/or alternatives to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Of the five program areas, the first two offer greatest opportunities for influence by the Clean Cities Program. Success in the other three depends largely on legislative action, policy, and the hard work of Clean Cities' industry partners (see box, page 5). At Washington Day 2001, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey unveiled the program's new strategic plan, which outlines DOE's efforts to help strengthen coalitions and build self-sustaining niche markets.  Stronger Coalitions The desire for strong existing coalitions clearly extends from the Clean Cities goal to see 75% of coalitions ""self-sustaining by 2005."" According to the Clean Cities plan, one key to coalition strength is effective leadership from its coordinator. The coordinator is a person who is usually asked to wear many hats. Various roles can include facilitator, marketer, motivator, grant writer, organizer, researcher, liaison, mediator, public affairs specialist, manager, and fundraiser. Those responsibilities are difficult enough for any full-time person, but especially for a coordinator who works only part-time. Of the 80 Clean Cities coalitions nationwide, only about 15 percent have full-time coordinators. Another source of strength is a diverse base of stakeholders. Coalitions should seek the active involvement of fuel providers, local and state governments, private fleet operators, and auto dealers. Other potential participants might be metropolitan planning organizations, large corporations, public relations firms, nonprofit organizations, airport management, universities, and local fire departments. A thriving board of directors, composed of individuals with diverse backgrounds beyond alternative fuels, can make an enormous difference in building a sustainable coalition. Board members often donate money, actively promote the organization, and solicit funds on its behalf. Strong boards have members who tend to stay longer than one term and provide organizational continuity. They take an active part in setting goals and objectives and evaluating coalition progress. Clean Cities will offer new training workshops to educate state and local policymakers and incorporate as a non-profit organization. Additional strategies under the ""strong existing coalitions"" heading include building fleet  National Clean Cities Program Director Shelley Launey addresses the Washington Day audience.  T  he Clean Cities' vision of the future is one of strong, vibrant, self-sustaining coalitions and niche markets in which alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) fleets operate 100% of the time on alternative fuel. It's a vision that includes 1 million AFVs on the road, using 1 billion gasoline gallon equivalents of alternative fuel. It is also a vision that could become reality. At Clean Cities Washington Day 2001, program staff and industry partners unveiled the specific strategies designed to help local coalitions build a viable national alternative fuels market. The strategies presented at Washington Day 2001 are a result of stakeholder input at the first-ever Clean Cities Washington Day, held on March 15, 2000. At that meeting, Clean Cities Program staff announced three new long-term goals, designed to advance the most fundamental purpose behind Clean Cities--to promote AFVs and increase alternative fuel use:  1 million AFVs on the road (using alternative fuel) by 2010,  1 billion gallons of alternative fuel used in AFVs annually by 2010,  75% of Clean Cities coalitions self-sustaining by 2005. To reach these goals, each Clean Cities coalition must increase AFVs in its region by 17 percent annually, with an  4  Photodisc   Filling a Niche  Niche market fleets, which often travel contained routes and are fueled at a central location, Airport vehicles make up one niche market, along with offer an enormous opportunity for government, transit, and cargo/delivery fleets. The plan includes a host of alternative fuels. And highnew numerical data on fuel use mileage fleets can benefit from and the numbers of vehicles that comprise all four targeted considerable cost savings using alternative fuel. Clean niche markets (see table, page 6). Gathered from various Cities coalitions have already identified several potentially sources including the U.S. Environmental Protection successful niche markets, including airports, transit agenAgency, U.S. Census Bureau, trade publications, and studcies, cargo and delivery companies, and government fleets. ies by consulting firms, the information will be extremely Although a wide variety of vehicle types can comprise a useful for gauging market potential within individual single niche, those vehicles can share an infrastructure, which helps ensure the success and longevity of the market. coalition regions.  Washington Day 2001 Highlights the Latest AFV Market Strategies In addition to the Clean Cities strategic plan, Washington Day attendees learned about the activities that DOE's alternative fuel industry partners have initiated to address Clean Cities priorities and drive the program closer to its goals. Kateri Callahan of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas and Paul Kerkhoven of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition tackled legislative incentives for AFV purchases and infrastructure development. They discussed recent events on Capitol Hill and reviewed potential upcoming legislation to encourage AFV and fuel-efficient vehicle purchases as well as alternative fuel infrastructure investments. For their presentations and more on possible legislation, check out the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml. To address increased funding for AFVs and infrastructure projects, Doug Howell of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute and Jake Plante of the Federal Aviation AdministraRuth Horton, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority; Greg tion (FAA) discussed Zilberfarb, Ford Motor Company; Amy Engel, two of the largest Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition grant programs availCoordinator able--DOT's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program (CMAQ) grants and FAA's AIR 21 grants for airport projects. Coalitions must work closely with their local metropolitan planning organizations to ensure CMAQ funds are used to support alternative fuel projects, said Howell. An open-microphone ""mini-town hall meeting,"" held in the afternoon, prompted an informal dialogue among all participants about topics such as the state of the natural gas industry, public access vs. niche market infrastructure, upgrading aging fuel stations, alternative fuels used as blends, and administrative expenses in DOE State Energy Program grants. For more information on any of the topics discussed at Washington Day 2001, please call the Clean Cities Hotline at 800-CCITIES.  Michael Klinkner of East Bay Clean Cities talks with Carol Butler, Executive Director, National Clean Cities, Inc.  Warren Gretz, NREL/PIX 00091  customer prospects, developing markets for alternative fuels, grant writing, and using existing outreach services such as the Clean Cities Hotline. All are described in the plan. The Clean Cities Program will offer training workshops in some of these areas in all six DOE regions, in 2001-02.  In the Clean Cities strategic plan, the term ""self-sustaining niche markets"" implies economic interdependence in a given area. The prevalence of AFVs should help ensure local demand for trained technicians and a fueling infrastructure. The availability of those services, in turn, makes the purchase of AFVs more attractive. When it works, the market becomes economically self-sustaining, with little or no government involvement.  5   Clean Cities coalitions will probably recognize some of the specific niche market strategies contained in the plan. But these ""tried and true"" activities, such as Advancing the AFV Choice events, coupled with new tools and strategies will help ensure sustainable AFV niche markets. Other niche market development strategies include Tiger Teams, largescale project funding, and a renewed focus on fleets required to purchase AFVs by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Clean Cities Tiger Teams are teams of experts, assembled by DOE, to assist coalitions with technical problems. Their expertise includes vehicle operations issues such as performance, safety, technician training, and driver acceptance; and fueling infrastructure issues such as station design and siting, and working with fuel providers. Tiger Teams can also help evaluate potential market opportunities and determine project feasibility. Coalitions are expected to exhaust other resources before applying for Tiger Team assistance. More information is available at www. ccities.doe.gov/tiger.html. Coalitions are encouraged to pursue large-scale AFVrelated projects, with the support of certain public sources of funding. One source is the federal government's new AIR 21 Program, which will provide as much as $2 million each to 10 airports, for AFV projects. Another, larger source is the U.S. Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which has provided more than $270 million to more than 200 AFV projects since 1991. Working with EPAct-mandated fleets, such as federal and state governments, is not a new concept for Clean Cities. Federal agencies, however, must comply with a new executive order, signed last year, which requires federal fleets to use alternative fuel in their AFVs more than 50 percent of the time by 2005. And although EPAct does not require state fleets to actually use alternative fuel in their AFVs, many states have authorized alternative fuel  refueling policies or have taken the initiative to mandate alternative fuel refueling policies. As stated in the Clean Cities plan, these mandated fleets offer coalitions an opportunity to build a refueling infrastructure network in which stations are ensured significant throughput. And although local governments are not covered by EPAct mandates, as school buses are often an effective AFV application. The Clean Cities plan encourages coalitions to identify all government fleet operators, but especially those affected by federal legislation, and hold a niche-specific Advancing the AFV Choice event to help them choose vehicles and to develop a fueling infrastructure. Among the new tools to assist coalitions in obtaining funds is a national database of CMAQ-funded alternative fuel projects. With support from a DOE grant, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute is analyzing national trends and creating the database help Clean Cities coalitions determine how CMAQ funds are allocated. Current data is more difficult to use due to the different reporting styles of state and local governments. The Clean Cities plan also highlights the products and tools for cultivating niche markets, which resemble the ones available in the ""strong existing coalitions"" program area (described earlier). Educational workshops, for example, will offer training in specific niches, such as airports. Other new tools include educational software on alternative fuel school buses and a shuttle bus took kit for coalitions interested in airport shuttle projects. Communications resources such as fact sheets and case studies are also available in print and via the Clean Cities Web site, www. ccities.doe.gov. The Clean Cities strategic plan was distributed to all Washington Day 2001 participants and was mailed to coalition coordinators who were unable to attend. An electronic copy of the plan is posted on the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/whats_new.shtml.

But neither commodity--nor thousands of others--would be possible without long-haul trucks. Nationwide, about 480,000 long-haul, heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7 and 8) deliver goods from one place to another. Many travel hundreds of miles daily and frequently stop overnight. Sleeper cabs provide drivers with spacious and comfortable accommodations, but to keep the engine warm in the winter and maintain the cab's climate control conditions, most drivers leave the engine idling. According to Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) estimates, the average truck sits idling for up to 1,800 hours each year--an equivalent of 75 straight days. Just one hour of idling burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year, ANL says. Idling reduces fuel economy and wears the engine, requiring operators to invest more in maintenance and repair. It also pollutes the air. ANL estimates that each year, long haul heavyduty trucks produce 10 million tons of carbon dioxide, about 60,000 tons of nitrogen oxides, and nearly 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide just by idling. only 10% to 15% of the fuel a diesel truck engine uses to heat the engine or run cab heating and air conditioning. They are commercially available, easy to install, efficient, and relatively inexpensive to operate.  Just one burns a gallon of diesel fuel. Collectively, that's more than 800 million gallons of diesel lost each year.  By burning less fuel, cab comfort units dramatically reduce harmful emissions and, perhaps more important to cost-conscious drivers, they can save the average long-haul truck operator as much as $1,900 each year in fuel costs alone. Less time idling also means less wear on the engine, which enables operators to save on preventative maintehour of idling nance and repair costs as well. Despite the benefits, truck operators are still reluctant to pay the initial cost of cab comfort units, which are typically about $3,000. But ANL estimates that the significant fuel and maintenance savings will help operators see a return on their investment after just one year of use.  Truck operators must stay warm in the winter and cool during the summer, but now there is an alternative to idling. ""Anti-idling devices"" include direct-fired burners for cab and engine block heating; thermal storage devices for heating and cooling; and auxiliary power units for heating, cooling, and electrical power. These devices use  DOE has launched a program to promote the use of cab comfort units. The message: Don't Idle Your Profits Away! DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) created an exhibit booth to showcase cab comfort technology and communicate the anti-idling message to truck operators at truck shows. ""Some truck drivers think our efforts are designed to make them suffer in unheated or uncooled cabs,"" said OHVT's Sid Diamond. ""That is not at all our intent. Our goal is to show drivers that they really don't need a 600horsepower diesel engine to run their trucks' climate control units and appliances. Today there are a number of options that provide more energy efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solutions to control cab comfort and safety.""

FutureTruck Students Rise to the Challenge Sport utility vehicles (SUVs) have emerged as the most popular single vehicle class in the United States. But they generally use more fuel and produce greater exhaust emissions than passenger cars. They're big, and getting bigger, in terms of both popularity and physical size. There's no doubt that SUVs are here to stay. The challenge is to create an SUV that meets the needs of the future, with better fuel efficiency and lower emissions, while retaining the comfort and performance that consumers have grown to expect. Fifteen teams of university students are rising to meet the challenge through FutureTruck, a four-year competition sponsored by DOE and General Motors (GM). Through FutureTruck, university students are building the SUV of the future, using advanced technologies such as fuel cells, light-weight materials, innovative powertrain strategies, and alternative fuels. GM is supplying seed money, prize money, vehicles (Chevrolet Suburbans), and facilities for testing and evaluation. Ford Motor Company will become the automotive sponsor in 2002 and 2003. FutureTruck student teams compete in a series of performance events including acceleration, trailer tow performance, off-road handling, and on-road fuel economy; as well as static design events, such as consumer acceptability and engineering design. The vehicles are tested for full fuel cycle analysis, and each team must also prepare a written and oral technical presentation. Last year marked the start of the four-year FutureTruck competition. With less than five months to modify their vehicles, students managed to increase on-road fuel efficiency of their Chevrolet Suburbans by 13%, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% (compared to stock vehicles).

""It's inspiring,"" said Steve Gurski, team leader for Virginia Tech. ""In FutureTruck there's always a new challenge that no one has ever met before."" According to Gurski, undergraduate students and their team leaders spend as many as 30 hours per week on their vehicles. Team leaders--typically graduate students--spend even more time. They also help leverage funds and support for the project, write reports and waivers, and direct resources to help solve problems when necessary. Team leaders ensure that the team, and the vehicle, are ready for the June competition. For many students, FutureTruck is a life-changing experience. ""I got involved because of the toys, not realizing what a difference it would make in my career,"" said Michael Ogburn, last year 's team leader for Virginia Tech. ""Three years of playing with cars and trucks left me so aware of my passion to make a difference in the struggle to save the planet, that it makes my head spin to imagine doing anything else,"" he said. The FutureTruck 2001 competition will be held June 4-13. Events will be held at the GM Proving Ground in Milford, Mich. Teams will then travel to Washington D.C. for an awards ceremony and vehicle display on Capitol Hill.  Facilitating the Next Generation of Natural Gas Trucks The new Next Generation Natural Gas Vehicle (NGNGV) Program, sponsored by DOE and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, will develop natural gas-powered trucks with significantly lowered exhaust emissions, for commercial development in the next several years. The NGNGV Program vision is to build one new medium-duty (Class 3-6) CNG truck, and one new heavy-duty (Class 7-8) LNG truck by 2004, using technologies to reduce emissions of particulate matter as well as oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Typical NOx levels for today's low-emission natural gas trucks are in the range of 2-2.5 grams per brake-horsepower. The program has targeted NOx emissions of roughly one quarter of that level, at .5 grams. Specific technological advances may take the form of improved engine-combustion designs, new dual-fuel systems, and better catalytic treatment of exhaust. The program is expected to draw interest from original equipment manufacturers as well as suppliers of sensors, engine-control systems, and fuel-air delivery systems. Information is available from Kevin Walkowicz at 303-275-4492, or at www.ctts.nrel.gov/ngngv.  Virginia Tech engineering students have equipped their Suburban with hydrogen fuel cell power.

The vehicles began their journeys at various locations throughout the West and Midwest, traveling along major interstates and stopping at propane refueling stations along the way. At each stop, drivers gave out information about the road rally and propane vehicles, and had a chance to interact with the public. They also collected signatures from the people they met during the rally into a logbook. Rally drivers traveled a combined total of more than 4600 miles and passed through 11 states and Monterrey, Mexico. Approximately 27 government entities, associations, and companies worked together to make the road rally and propane conference a success. Sponsors included several Clean Cities coalitions, propane associations, propane distributors, and vehicle manufacturers. Ernie Oakes, the Regional Clean Cities Program Manager for the Department of Energy/Denver Regional Office applauded the venture and said, ""The rally showed local communities that the propane industry and automobile manufacturers Photos from Ferrellgas Inc., NREL/PIX 09938  RALLY are working together to bring a cleaner auto fuel to the general public for use in their everyday lives."" Participating in the event were representatives of both government and private industry, from Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, and Monterrey, Mexico. The rally was the first event of its kind featuring dedicated propane vehicles. On Monday, February 5, the rally participants arrived in Kansas City just in time for the Propane Vehicle Conference and Exposition. The conference featured displays from the major auto manufacturers, propane distributors, and propane associations. Lead vehicles from each leg of the rally were driven onto the conference floor, where they remained on display throughout the conference. The signatures that were collected at the road rally stops were also on display during the conference.  Below: Ivan Jacques of Salt Lake City refuels a Ford Excursion.

Twenty-five of the company's delivery vans (or 80% of its entire fleet) run on compressed natural gas (CNG). The vans refuel at local public stations, and owner Bruce McShan offers creative incentives to encourage drivers to fuel with CNG. McShan decided to start using CNG 10 years ago, and has enjoyed significant savings associated with CNG. Connie's Pizza, Chicago: Since 1997, Connie's Pizza has been delivering pizza throughout the Chicago area, using CNG vehicles. Of the company's 50 vehicles, 18 are CNG Chevy S-10 pickups. Connie's also owns slow-fill compreseducation, providing training in refueling and vehicle operations. Vehicles are refueled at the 600 Schwan's depots located across the country. According to Macht, the drivers have been pleased with vehicle performance. Because Schwan's truck operators are commissioned sales people, they have a higher stake in the vehicles. If their trucks don't function, drivers don't make money. As for expanding its AFV fleet, Macht said the company will first focus on larger urban, non-attainment areas.

From the Automakers  Hybrids are Big at Detroit's Auto Show Hybrid sport utility vehicles (SUVs) took to the stage at the North American International Auto Show, held in Detroit in January. With the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius already on the streets and interest in energy efficiency on the rise, several automakers used the auto show as a forum to showcase their upcoming plans to bring advanced technology vehicles to market. Ford Motor Company announced its plans for a hybrid Explorer, which will debut sometime after the Escape hybrid is introduced in 2003. Ford showcased the hybrid Escape at the Los Angeles International Auto Show a week before the show in Detroit. The Escape, expected to get 40 miles per gallon, will use an electric motor for propulsion and a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Explorer will use a six-cylinder engine with electric assist. Both models will feature integrated starter-generator technology that automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops, such as at a traffic light. The Explorer hybrid will also employ a regenerative braking system for its 42-volt battery used to provide an acceleration boost at start up. A smaller 12-volt battery will supplement power to run devices such as DaimlerChrysler PowerBox hybrid-electric concept SUV  lamps and radios. For more information, check out Ford's hybrid Web site: www.hybridford.com. Among the newest concepts DaimlerChrysler unveiled at the Detroit auto show was the Dodge PowerBox, a hybrid-electric SUV. Unlike other hybrid SUVs, the PowerBox combines a supercharged V-6 engine that uses compressed natural gas (CNG) and an electric motor to supplement power and increase efficiency. A large SUV, the PowerBox concept has room for eight passengers, comparable in size to the gasoline-powered Dodge Durango, but with 60% better fuel economy. And because it's pow-  12  DaimlerChrysler   ered primarily by CNG, the PowerBox runs cleaner, with near zero emissions. For more information, visit www. daimlerchrysler.com. Building on last year 's Precept hybrid concept vehicle, General Motors unveiled its new hybrid propulsion system, the ParadiGM, which the company will be able to apply to a variety of vehicles, from passenger sedans to SUVs and trucks to commercial vehicles. The ParadiGM system combines a conventional V-6 or an inline fourcylinder engine with two electric motors and a battery pack to provide increased efficiency. The first hybrid application will be a mid-size SUV with fuel economy 20% better than its conventionally powered counterparts. GM's hybrid SUV is expected to debut in 2004; the company announced that at least 7,000 vehicles will be produced in the first year. More hybrids may follow, depending on market demand.

An AT-PZEV gets distinct recognition and greater credits because it has a reduced ""full cycle"" emissions impact. ""Being the first to receive AT-PZEV status is nice for Honda and the near-zero emission Civic GX. It also proves the value of natural gas as a long-term alternative to gasoline,"" Ellis says. Approved in January, CARB's new ZEV rule will require the sale of an estimated 4,650 full-size model year 2003 electric cars in California, and a comparable number of other super-clean and advanced technology vehicles as well. The ZEV minimums will rise to about 22,000 vehicles in 2010, and 50,000 in 2018. The SULEV provision allows car manufacturers to receive partial credits with PZEVs, including AT-PZEVs such as the Civic GX.  Honda Civic GX receives California's AT-PZEV certification The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in late December granted American Honda Motor Company partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV) certification for its natural-gas-powered Civic GX. The rating came just weeks before the 2001 model car, described by the manufacturer as ""cleanest on earth,"" hit the U.S. market. The standard, which falls under the super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) provision of CARB's recently released ZEV mandate, requires vehicles to support 15year, 150,000 mile emission system durability. They must also have zero evaporative emissions. Under this stringent SULEV requirement, the Civic GX is now the first advanced-technology, partial-zero emission vehicle (ATPZEV) says Stephen Ellis, American Honda's Manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicles. DaimlerChrysler 4-passenger NEV  DaimlerChrysler Adds Neighborhood Electric Vehicles to Its Portfolio DaimlerChrysler announced its acquisition of Global Electric MotorCars (GEM), becoming the first major automaker to sell neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) in the United States. GEM, based in North Dakota, produces two- and fourpassenger NEVs that can be licensed for use on public roads. The vehicles recharge in about eight hours using 110-volt household alterative current. NEVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are well suited for niche applications including local governments, parking enforcement, university and business campuses, and planned communities. The city of Denver, for example, through its ""Take Charge"" program, provides three NEVs for city employees to use for business downtown. American Honda Motor Co., NREL/PIX 09965  ""DaimlerChrysler is excited about the emerging market of neighborhood electric vehicles and the opportunities that GEM affords,"" said Mike Clement, Director of Alternative Fuel Sales and Marketing.

The zoo uses two electric Ford Rangers and three electric ""trikes"" (bicycles with three wheels) to travel from building to building. The pickups are also used in daily grounds-keeping activities. The Tulsa Zoo is a division of Tulsa Parks, a member of the Tulsa Area Clean Cities Coalition. Triangle Clean Cities, which serves the Raleigh-DurhamChapel Hill region of North Carolina, was designated the 80th Clean Cities coalition on March 19. Because the event was within driving distance from Washington, DC, several members of DOE's Clean Cities team showed their support for the coalition and for AFVs by driving the more than 250 miles to North Carolina in a natural gas vehicle and a propane vehicle. The Triangle Clean Cities Coalition's designation celebration, held at North Carolina State University, was part of an event staged to help advance fuel choices in the area. With flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) making up a majority of the region's more than 1,700 vehicles, the coalition remains active in promoting the increased use of E85. Last year, then-Governor Jim Hunt issued a proclamation announcing his support for the Triangle Clean Cities effort and mandating E85 use in state fleets whenever possible.  Birmingham Boasts Natural Gas Buses The Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) has joined a growing number of transit agencies across the country in a commitment to use compressed natural gas (CNG) buses. The BJCTA is 57% alternativefueled; of its 77 buses, 43 use CNG. According to Mark Bond, Director of Fleet Operations for City Transit (a BJCTA contractor), drivers are particularly pleased with the new buses' power and acceleration. Each of the CNG buses is clearly marked as a clean fuel vehicle, to help inform Birmingham residents of their transportation choices. The city of Birmingham is working towards a Clean Cities designation.  Photodisc  Oklahoma Utility Nears 100% Alternative Fuel Use Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) is closing in on 100% alternative fuel use. Of the utility's 1,120 vehicles, more than 800 (or 71.4%) run on natural gas. According to ONG's John Siska, last year the fleet used approximately 500,000 gallons of natural gas, and it plans to use more. ""Our goal is to reach 100% of our fleet,"" said Siska. ""Any vehicle that can possibly be converted and is close to refueling will either be converted or replaced with an original equipment vehicle,"" he said. Last year, Natural Gas Fuels ranked ONG third on its list of the top utility natural gas fleets, and the utility tied for first in alternative fuel vehicle projections. ONG is an active member of the Clean Cities coalitions of central Oklahoma and the Tulsa area.

The Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition (TC4) will become the 81st member of the program on May 31, 2001. The TC4, in conjunction with the Minnesota E85 team, has been successful in building an alternative fuel infrastructure network, and last year celebrated the opening of the region's 50th publicly accessible E85 station. With its partners, the TC4 has also initiated a large-scale educational and outreach effort to promote E85 use by the public, and has set specific fuel use and fuel sales goals to help target its efforts. The Vermont Clean Vehicles Coalition is planning a designation ceremony for this summer. The coalition serves one of the most rural Clean Cities regions of the country. It has promoted alternative fuels for several years, and has received significant media attention for having placed AFVs in fleets throughout the state. The coalition is also unique in terms of active participation by government leaders, including both of Vermont's U.S. Senators, its congressional representative, and its governor.  Three New Coalitions Join Clean Cities Program By summer 2001, more than 80 coalitions will be part of the Clean Cities network. Each new coalition is the first in its state to join the Clean Cities Program.  14  John Farley, NREL/PIX 09972   Federal News DOE Names Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Project Recipients DOE's Federal AFV USER Program recently awarded funds for three separate projects, designed to increase the availability of alternative fuels such as E85 and compressed natural gas (CNG). The successful entries were chosen from proposals submitted in response to a solicitation in June 2000. The Federal AFV USER Program supports the expansion of alternative fuel infrastructure by encouraging the placement and use of federally owned AFVs in six specific cities: San Francisco; Denver; Albuquerque; MinneapolisSt. Paul; Salt Lake City; and Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. Roughly $266,000 in federal funding was awarded for the three projects, which have a combined total value of $812,000 including the cost share contributed by non-federal partners. Each partner 's contribution was at least 50%. Generally, the projects will support fleet managers and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) buyers. They include:  The Twin Cities AFV USER project, ""Using the Federal Fleet to Model the E85 Way,"" a customer education and marketing project that promotes the use of E85 fuel, $214,000;  Pinnacle CNG Co.'s DOE/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) CNG Refueling Station, for the installation and operation of a CNG fueling station at LLNL, $465,000; and  The Technological Research and Development Authority's deployment of ethanol fuel infrastructure for federal fleets in Melbourne-Titusville, for the installation and operation of an E85 fueling station at the Kennedy Space Center, $184,000. Because federal fleets are required by Executive Order 13149 to reduce petroleum consumption, DOE is targeting infrastructure and promotion projects to benefit them. Although the primary intent of the projects is to support the federal fleet, they were also evaluated by their potential to provide alternative fuel to state and local government fleets, commercial fleets, and the public.

Formed to help coalitions reduce the cost of AFVs, the program offers rebates of $2,000 per vehicle to coalition stakeholders who purchase AFVs. Under the terms of the deal, the funding must be used to buy dedicated original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alternative fuel vehicles. For more information, contact your Department of Energy (DOE) Regional Clean Cities manager.  Fleet Buyer's Guide Adds Electric Bikes, Hybrids, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles Electric bikes, hybrid cars, and neighborhood electric vehicles were recently added to DOE's Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer 's Guide. The site walks fleet managers through a step-by-step process that helps them identify whether Energy Policy Act (EPAct) regulations apply to them, and, if so, helps them make informed alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchase decisions. Although electric bikes, HEVs, and neighborhood electric vehicles don't qualify for EPAct credit, they were added to the Web site because many fleets are interested in purchasing them. Currently the Buyer 's Guide has specifications and information on two HEVs, eight neighborhood electric vehicles, and more than a dozen electric bikes. Although the site was developed to assist fleets, the public is welcome to use it. Visit www.fleets.doe.gov, and click on the link for Advanced Technology Vehicles.  Where in the World are Alternative Fuels? The redesigned Clean Cities International Web site answers that and many other questions about Clean Cities around the world. The site, which features a special section in Spanish, is packed with detailed information about the program, the countries and cities involved, new publications, upcoming international events, and much more. Modeled after DOE's Clean Cities Program, Clean Cities International works with governments, non-governmental organizations, and the U.S. alternative fuel industry to help establish foundations for viable alternative fuel markets in other interested countries.

Building on the hybrid technology developed for the Insight, the new sedan features an improved version of the Honda Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) System, which enables the vehicle to achieve an ultra-high fuel economy of 29.5km/L. Environmentally friendly, this Civic hybrid sedan has been certified as an Ultra Low-Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. Details on the release of the hybrid Civic sedan in the United States are still pending.  Full Story .    Toyota Announces Sale of RAV4-EV to California Retail Customers  Beginning in February 2002, California retail customers will be able to purchase Toyota's zero-emissions RAV4 electric vehicle (EV) at local car dealerships. This zero-emission version of Toyota's popular compact sport utility vehicle is powered by a rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery and permanent magnet motor that enables it to travel up to 78 mph with a maximum range of 80 to 100 miles per charge. It will be the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electric vehicle to be sold to retail customers.      The decision to sell the RAV4-EV to the general public in California resulted from the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2001 passage of the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate. This legislation requires 10% of all new vehicle sold in the state to meet low emissions standards and 2% of the new vehicle purchases to be zero emission cars.      Toyota began leasing the RAV4-EV to select corporations and utilities in 1997. Today, there are approximately 900 electric RAV4s in service nationwide, including 700 on California roads. The RAV4-EV will have a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $42,000 but a $9,000 CARB incentive and $3,000 IRS credit should bring the price of the vehicle and in-home charging device down to about $31,000.

Ford and Toyota Engage in Talks to Produce Joint Hybrid Vehicle  America's Ford Motor Company and Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation are discussing plans to develop a new hybrid electric gasoline vehicle that would be produced in North America. Both companies would benefit from the increased economies of scale that joint production would bring, because developing hybrid technology is extremely expensive. For example, Toyota began producing the hybrid-electric Prius subcompact in June of 2000, but continues to loose money on the sale of these vehicles despite record demand for them.     Both companies share a commitment to increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. Ford is a key industry participant in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and has pledged to improve the fuel economy of its sport-utility vehicles up to 25% by 2005. Toyota's experience developing fuel-efficient hybrid technology for the Prius could help Ford to achieve this goal.    Talks between Toyota and Ford started in July of 2000 when former chief executive, Jacques Nasser met with Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. Dialog continues between the two companies with William Clay Ford Jr. now at the helm of the American automobile manufacturer. Both companies hope to clinch a deal on the joint hybrid-electric venture by the end of the year.        November 2001     Hyundai Fuel Cell Vehicle Wins Gold at Michelin Challenge Bibendum   The Hyundai Santa Fe fuel cell-powered sport utility vehicle took home two gold medals and two silver medals at the 2001  Michelin Challenge Bibendum  held at the California Speedway in Fontana, California on October 26th -29th. This four-day event has traditionally been an excellent opportunity for motor vehicle manufacturers to showcase the performance of near-term and long-range environmentally innovative automobiles and demonstrate their compatibility with driving performance, comfort, and safety. Competing automobiles were judged in nine individual categories including design, acceleration, braking, handling, slalom, fuel economy, range, noise level, and emissions. Participating as a member of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership , the Santa Fe fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) faired extremely well in its first North American vehicle competition, earning gold medals in the emissions and noise tests and silver medals in the slalom and fuel efficiency trials. A total of six hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles from various manufacturers were entered in the competition.           GM Announces Production of Full-Size Ethanol Pickups   To meet the increasing U.S. demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), General Motors (GM) announced it would begin production of a full-sized flex-fuel pickup truck that can run on E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), regular gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels. The flex-fuel option will now be available on 1,500 series Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks that have 5,300 Vortec engines. The new pickups will increase GM's existing line of ethanol vehicles, which includes sport-utility vehicles such as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, and Chevy Suburban, as well as smaller pickups like the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma. For more information, visit  GM's Alternative Fuels  Web site.       OTT Releases 2002 Quality Metrics Report    Interested in how light- and heavy-duty alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicle programs will impact the future of our country? The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technology (OTT) has just released its  2002 Quality Metric Report (PDF 1.6 MB) . The report discusses the potential emissions benefits, petroleum reductions, and economic impacts that 41 OTT-funded programs will have on the United States from 2001 until 2030. Light-duty vehicle technologies were evaluated for passenger automobiles and class 1 and 2 ""light"" trucks. These technologies included flexible fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends), electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas, and stratified charge direct injection. Hybrid, natural gas, and advanced diesel technologies were evaluated for heavy-duty vehicles. Various analytical tools were used to develop the results. Each separate technology was analyzed according to when and how quickly the new technology could potentially enter the marketplace.         Maryland Opens First Ethanol Station   Many were on hand November 14 to celebrate the opening of Maryland's first public access ethanol fueling station. Located at 3240 Fort Meade Road (Rt. 198) in Laurel, Md., the Chevron station will dispense E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Construction of the new station was made possible through a U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded to the Maryland Energy Administration.    An alternative fuel made from renewable resources, such as corn or biomass, ethanol has significant emissions benefits versus reformulated gasoline. Its use in flexible fuel vehicles can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increase our nation's energy security.       QUANTUM and ProCon Begin Production of Dedicated Propane Vans   QUANTUM Technologies WorldWide, Inc., and the Propane Promotion Consortium, Inc., (ProCon) announced that they will begin production on two models of dedicated propane vans. The only dedicated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vans available on the market, the G2500 passenger van and the G3500 cargo van will be certified ULEV (California ultra low emission vehicle) and ILEV (federal inherently low emission vehicle) and have a maximum range of about 250 miles. Production will begin immediately but there will be a two-month waiting period after orders are placed. Vans will be available through selected General Motors dealers nationwide. For more information, visit the  QUANTUM  Web site.     DOE's Regional Biomass Energy Program recently completed eight new  success story fact sheets  that are available on the RBEP Web site.

September 2001     New EPRI Study Indicates Consumers Favor Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles   A recent study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California shows that consumers favor potential plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology because it offers savings on fuel and maintenance, use of an existing 120-volt infrastructure, and increased range over current gas electric hybrid vehicles.     Conventional HEVs such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius have fuel economies close to 42 mpg and rely on a gasoline engine to generate the electricity used to recharge the hybrid system's battery. The gasoline engine of the plug-in hybrid would be used more as a ""power-assist"" for long trips or on steep hills, and give the vehicle a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg. When fully charged, a plug-in HEV would act as a pure electric vehicle (EV) capable of traveling up to 60 miles daily in EV mode.    30 to 50 percent of the participants surveyed indicated that they would choose a plug-in HEV or non-plug HEV even if the car were priced 25 percent higher than a conventionally powered vehicle costing $19,000. 63 percent of those surveyed said they preferred plugging in an HEV at home because they could make use of a nearby 120-volt outlet.    Although there are no plug-in HEV models currently in production, the environmental and petroleum reduction benefits associated with these vehicles, along with the fact that they can be deployed with little to no change to the fueling infrastructure make them very attractive to both consumers and automakers.  Full Story .    Electric Trolleys to Grace Connecticut Streets  The city of New Haven recently unveiled its plan to create a new downtown shuttle service using four electric trolleys that will help shoppers get around the fragmented retail district.  According to Lee Grannis, a coordinator with the Greater New Haven Clean Cities Coalition, most of the $1 million price tag for the four trolleys will be offset by federal grants. New Haven will pay about $200,000.  Manufactured by California-based Ebus, each air-conditioned trolley can carry 27 people and travel between 75 and 100 miles between charges.        August 2001     Water Taxi Launches Hybrid ""Water Bus""   Water Taxi  in southern Florida recently launched its first hybrid electric ""water bus""— The Clay Shaw  (named after the Florida congressman).

July 2001      Honda Opens Hydrogen Refueling Station in L.A.   American Honda Motors Corporation took a step into the future of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles by opening the first hydrogen refueling station in Los Angeles this week.  The state-of-the-art refueling station is completely self-sufficient and uses solar power to produce enough hydrogen to power a single fuel cell vehicle for a year. Photovoltaic cells located at the station collect energy from the sun, which is then converted into electricity for extracting hydrogen from water. Extracted hydrogen is then pumped into storage tanks for use by hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Honda fuel cell vehicles have been on the road since 1999 as part of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership (CAFCP) .     GTI to Hold Metropolitan Energy Design Competition   Do you think you have a solution for meeting the future energy needs of our nation's expanding cities? The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) is looking for your unique ideas on how to solve future problems such as energy shortages, unreliable delivery of electricity, highway gridlock, air and water pollution, and urban sprawl. Based on the theme  Energizing America's Cities , the U.S. Competition on Metropolitan Energy Design ( PDF 130 KB ) is sponsored by GTI in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy and the energy industry. The top eight designs will be presented at the  Energizing America's Cities  conference in Chicago on May 30-31, 2002.

RFA Vice President Confirms Ethanol Supply During Senate Energy Hearing   Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) Vice President Bob Dinneen met with members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week to assure committee members that the ethanol industry would be able to meet the oxygenate demand for reformulated gasoline in California. Early this year the state of California petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be waived from the gasoline oxygenate requirement mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. The EPA later denied California's waiver request. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), currently used as an oxygenate additive in reformulated gasoline, is contaminating ground water supplies in California, as well as several other states. Using Ethanol instead of MTBE as an oxygenate blend in reformulated gasoline has many favorable benefits. Like MTBE, ethanol will increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline, however ethanol is not harmful to the environment and is a renewable fuel. Blending ethanol with reformulated gasoline will also help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. During the meeting with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dinneen told members that 34 existing ethanol plants are undergoing expansion and eleven new plants are under construction. As a result, the ethanol industry expects to have an additional 300 million gallons of production capacity on line by the end of this year.       June 2001      Propane Education & Research Council Recognizes Six Fleets with ""Exceptional Energy"" Awards   Six vehicle fleets were recognized for their outstanding leadership in implementing propane as a motor fuel at 7th National Clean Cities Conference and Exposition on May 16, 2001.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Develops New Clean Emissions Technology   Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed an emissions technology capable of reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines by 50%. This new technology employs the use of an electrically charged gas called plasma, along with a class of zeolite catalyst to reduce harmful vehicle exhaust emissions. NOx produced by cars running on gasoline and diesel fuel is a leading contributor to ground-level ozone and smog, which has been linked to lung damage, asthma, cancer, and premature death. New hybrid electric diesel engines developed by the big three automakers are already capable of meeting the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goal of 80 miles per gallon. As researchers continue to refine this process, use of the plasma reactor concept with a catalyst could help achieve the other PNGV target of 90% reduction in NOx emissions.  Full Story .

Ford and Toyota Engage in Talks to Produce Joint Hybrid Vehicle  America's Ford Motor Company and Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation are discussing plans to develop a new hybrid electric gasoline vehicle that would be produced in North America. Both companies would benefit from the increased economies of scale that joint production would bring, because developing hybrid technology is extremely expensive. For example, Toyota began producing the hybrid-electric Prius subcompact in June of 2000, but continues to loose money on the sale of these vehicles despite record demand for them.     Both companies share a commitment to increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. Ford is a key industry participant in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and has pledged to improve the fuel economy of its sport-utility vehicles up to 25% by 2005. Toyota's experience developing fuel-efficient hybrid technology for the Prius could help Ford to achieve this goal.    Talks between Toyota and Ford started in July of 2000 when former chief executive, Jacques Nasser met with Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. Dialog continues between the two companies with William Clay Ford Jr. now at the helm of the American automobile manufacturer. Both companies hope to clinch a deal on the joint hybrid-electric venture by the end of the year.        November 2001     Hyundai Fuel Cell Vehicle Wins Gold at Michelin Challenge Bibendum   The Hyundai Santa Fe fuel cell-powered sport utility vehicle took home two gold medals and two silver medals at the 2001  Michelin Challenge Bibendum  held at the California Speedway in Fontana, California on October 26th -29th. This four-day event has traditionally been an excellent opportunity for motor vehicle manufacturers to showcase the performance of near-term and long-range environmentally innovative automobiles and demonstrate their compatibility with driving performance, comfort, and safety. Competing automobiles were judged in nine individual categories including design, acceleration, braking, handling, slalom, fuel economy, range, noise level, and emissions. Participating as a member of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership , the Santa Fe fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) faired extremely well in its first North American vehicle competition, earning gold medals in the emissions and noise tests and silver medals in the slalom and fuel efficiency trials. A total of six hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles from various manufacturers were entered in the competition.           GM Announces Production of Full-Size Ethanol Pickups   To meet the increasing U.S. demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), General Motors (GM) announced it would begin production of a full-sized flex-fuel pickup truck that can run on E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), regular gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels. The flex-fuel option will now be available on 1,500 series Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks that have 5,300 Vortec engines. The new pickups will increase GM's existing line of ethanol vehicles, which includes sport-utility vehicles such as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, and Chevy Suburban, as well as smaller pickups like the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma.

OTT Releases 2002 Quality Metrics Report    Interested in how light- and heavy-duty alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicle programs will impact the future of our country? The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technology (OTT) has just released its  2002 Quality Metric Report (PDF 1.6 MB) . The report discusses the potential emissions benefits, petroleum reductions, and economic impacts that 41 OTT-funded programs will have on the United States from 2001 until 2030. Light-duty vehicle technologies were evaluated for passenger automobiles and class 1 and 2 ""light"" trucks. These technologies included flexible fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends), electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas, and stratified charge direct injection. Hybrid, natural gas, and advanced diesel technologies were evaluated for heavy-duty vehicles. Various analytical tools were used to develop the results. Each separate technology was analyzed according to when and how quickly the new technology could potentially enter the marketplace.         Maryland Opens First Ethanol Station   Many were on hand November 14 to celebrate the opening of Maryland's first public access ethanol fueling station. Located at 3240 Fort Meade Road (Rt. 198) in Laurel, Md., the Chevron station will dispense E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Construction of the new station was made possible through a U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded to the Maryland Energy Administration.    An alternative fuel made from renewable resources, such as corn or biomass, ethanol has significant emissions benefits versus reformulated gasoline. Its use in flexible fuel vehicles can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increase our nation's energy security.

September 2001     New EPRI Study Indicates Consumers Favor Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles   A recent study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California shows that consumers favor potential plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology because it offers savings on fuel and maintenance, use of an existing 120-volt infrastructure, and increased range over current gas electric hybrid vehicles.     Conventional HEVs such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius have fuel economies close to 42 mpg and rely on a gasoline engine to generate the electricity used to recharge the hybrid system's battery. The gasoline engine of the plug-in hybrid would be used more as a ""power-assist"" for long trips or on steep hills, and give the vehicle a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg. When fully charged, a plug-in HEV would act as a pure electric vehicle (EV) capable of traveling up to 60 miles daily in EV mode.    30 to 50 percent of the participants surveyed indicated that they would choose a plug-in HEV or non-plug HEV even if the car were priced 25 percent higher than a conventionally powered vehicle costing $19,000. 63 percent of those surveyed said they preferred plugging in an HEV at home because they could make use of a nearby 120-volt outlet.    Although there are no plug-in HEV models currently in production, the environmental and petroleum reduction benefits associated with these vehicles, along with the fact that they can be deployed with little to no change to the fueling infrastructure make them very attractive to both consumers and automakers.

RFA Vice President Confirms Ethanol Supply During Senate Energy Hearing   Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) Vice President Bob Dinneen met with members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week to assure committee members that the ethanol industry would be able to meet the oxygenate demand for reformulated gasoline in California. Early this year the state of California petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be waived from the gasoline oxygenate requirement mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. The EPA later denied California's waiver request. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), currently used as an oxygenate additive in reformulated gasoline, is contaminating ground water supplies in California, as well as several other states. Using Ethanol instead of MTBE as an oxygenate blend in reformulated gasoline has many favorable benefits. Like MTBE, ethanol will increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline, however ethanol is not harmful to the environment and is a renewable fuel. Blending ethanol with reformulated gasoline will also help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. During the meeting with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dinneen told members that 34 existing ethanol plants are undergoing expansion and eleven new plants are under construction. As a result, the ethanol industry expects to have an additional 300 million gallons of production capacity on line by the end of this year.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Develops New Clean Emissions Technology   Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed an emissions technology capable of reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines by 50%. This new technology employs the use of an electrically charged gas called plasma, along with a class of zeolite catalyst to reduce harmful vehicle exhaust emissions. NOx produced by cars running on gasoline and diesel fuel is a leading contributor to ground-level ozone and smog, which has been linked to lung damage, asthma, cancer, and premature death. New hybrid electric diesel engines developed by the big three automakers are already capable of meeting the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goal of 80 miles per gallon. As researchers continue to refine this process, use of the plasma reactor concept with a catalyst could help achieve the other PNGV target of 90% reduction in NOx emissions.  Full Story .

April 2001       Transit Authority of Cedar Rapids Fuels Buses with Biodiesel   In March, the transit authority of Cedar Rapids Iowa made the decision to begin using biodiesel to fuel their fleet of over 60 buses. Officials said that the decision to begin using B20 (a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) was made because the environmentally friendly soy-based fuel will produce less air pollution then conventional diesel fuel. The use of biodiesel made from soybean oil (soy-diesel) will also help to promoted agriculture in the region.  Biodiesel is non-toxic, biodegradable, and produces significantly fewer EPA targeted emissions then conventional diesel. No modifications are required to diesel engines when switching to B20, and there is no loss of vehicle performance.

The document was intended to give a ""snapshot"" of current vehicle technologies and trends. DOE program managers use the document to plan test and evaluation activities that focus resources where they have the greatest impact. In 2001, an update to the original document was published. This document is the update for CY 2002. All of these publications are available at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog _info.html. The information in this document is based on several sources, which are listed in the Appendix. Most of the statistics came from the following sources: - The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Review, Monthly Energy Review, and Alternatives to Traditional Transportation Fuels; - Transportation Energy Data Book (edition 21), published by DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Air Pollution Emissions Trends Web site, www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/trends/index.html. These publications are usually produced annually. We used the most recent volumes available. The information on advanced technology vehicles in development came from various sources, including vehicle manufacturers and news services. Because this information changes daily, we set February 1, 2002, as the cut-off date for inclusion in this document. However, the vehicle tables will be updated on a quarterly basis and posted as separate documents on the Internet at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog_info.html.  Transportation Energy Use The transportation sector in the United States is a major consumer of energy. Figure 1 shows the total U.S. energy consumption from 1950 to 2000, categorized by transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial consumption. During 2000, transportation accounted for approximately 27% of the total energy consumption of 98.5 quadrillion Btu/year (source: EIA's Annual Energy Review). This is a 1.7% increase over total energy use for 1999.  1   Fi gure 1.

Figure 2 shows the dramatic difference between consumption and production. Although the gap only increased by 0.07% from 1999 to 2000, the average increase since 1985 was 4.5% per year. The balance of petroleum consumed by the U.S. is imported. According to EIA's Monthly Energy Review, nearly 59% of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. during 2000 (19.5 million barrels per day) was imported. In 2000, 45.4% of the total U.S. petroleum imports came from OPEC countries. (Table A in the Appendix lists U.S. petroleum imports by country.) Fi gure 2. U. S.

This is a slight decrease from the previous year. Figure 4 gives the breakdown of highway energy use by mode for 1999. The mix of vehicle types hasn't significantly changed since 1998. In 2001, an estimated 164 billion gallons of fuel were consumed in the U. S.--an increase of 1.5% over the previous year. Figure 5 shows the breakdown of fuel use by fuel type. Gasoline continues to make up approximately 77% of the fuel consumed. This percentage includes oxygenated fuels (methyl tertiary butyl ether [MTBE] and ethanol), which make up about 3% of the gasoline total. Diesel fuel comprises 22.9% of total vehicle fuel consumption during 2001. Fi gure 5. Estim a te d Consum pti on of Fue l s in the US (2001) Dies el 22.9% Alt. Fuel 0.2%  Fi gure 6.

Although alternative fuel makes up only 0.2% of the total fuel consumed in the United States, alternative fuel use has increased by about 4% per year during the past four years. Table 1 shows the percent difference in alternative fuel use for the past four years by  3   fuel type. Use of natural gas has increased steadily since 1997. Ethanol use continues to climb mainly because of the production of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) vehicles that are E85 compatible as standard and an increase in fueling stations offering E85. The majority of these new E85 stations are located in the Midwest. Electric vehicle use is also growing, especially in California where more than 16% of the total U.S. alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) reside. Table 1.

The majority of these vehicles were used for personal transportation, while only 6% were fleet vehicles. Figures 7a and b show the annual sales of vehicles for 1999 through 2001. Sales of automobiles and light trucks in 1999 broke the previous record set in 1986. Sales for 2000 were 2.7% higher than 1999. Despite predictions of low sales in 2001, light-duty vehicle sales were only 1.3% lower than in 2000. Automobiles as a group lost sales by nearly 4%, while light-duty trucks gained by 1.4%. The percentage of automobile verses light-duty trucks was nearly equal: 50.4% automobiles, 49.6% light-duty trucks. Sales of heavy-duty trucks (class 4 -8) declined by 25% in 2001, with the class 8 sector being hardest hit at 34% lower than 2000 figures. Figure 7a .

In 2000, an estimated 432,344 AFVs were in use in the U.S., representing an average 7% increase per year since 1992. Table 2 lists the 4   number of AFVs in the U.S. by fuel type and census region for 2000. Figure 8 breaks down the percentages of AFVs in use in 2000 by fuel type. Propane (or LPG) vehicles make up the bulk of AFVs at 62%. This includes original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products as well as aftermarket conversions. The second most common fuel used is natural gas, including compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which makes up 23.7% of the total. Alcohol-fueled vehicles that run on methanol and ethanol make up a combined 10.3% of the total AFVs, and electric vehicles (EVs) make up only 2%. According to EIA, the number of E85 compatible vehicles is around 34,700, a number that is deceptively low. Since 1998, most of the major OEMs have been producing certain models with an E85 engine as standard. The EIA counts include only vehicles that are intended to be used as flex-fuel vehicles. The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition estimates that more than 2 million E85 vehicles will be on the road by the end of the 2002 model year. Table 2.

Table 3 shows the number of alternative fueling stations in the U.S. by fuel and census region. According to DOE's Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), 5,443 fueling stations offered alternative fuels as of January 28, 2002. Stations offering E85 and electric charging stations saw an increase of nearly 31%. Methanol as a vehicular fuel has been decreasing over the past few years as a result of M85 products no longer being available. There are no longer any stations in the U.S. offering M85 fuel. Biodiesel is a fuel that has increased in popularity, mainly because the 20% blend of the fuel (B20) can be used in unmodified diesel engines.  5   Table 3.

These models operate on a variety of fuels, including CNG, LPG, electricity, and ethanol. Manufacturers are producing AFVs in all body styles to meet various fleet needs, from small two-seaters to full-size trucks and vans. For a list of AFVs available in the U.S. for model year 2002, see Table B in the Appendix. Alternative fuel and advanced technology heavy-duty vehicles are also available. The major engine manufacturers currently offer 20 alternative fuel engines (see Table C in the Appendix). This number includes natural gas and LPG fueled engines. Bus and heavy-duty truck manufacturers use these engines in a wide variety of vehicles.  Emissions As shown in Table 4, the transportation sector accounts for a large share of the national emissions of criteria pollutants. Highway vehicle emissions are somewhat less but still make up a significant portion of the overall contribution. These percentages are similar to the previous year. Table 4.

The tables contain an update to those provided in the original document and concentrate on the vehicles most likely to be available in the U.S. market. For a more complete listing of ATVs around the world, refer to the companion tables on the Internet at www. ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog _info.html. Definitions of the terms used to describe the development stage of a given vehicle vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply:      Research  In the early stages of development (drawings or models). Concept  An actual vehicle, usually operational, used by the manufacturer as a display or show vehicle. Prototype  A working vehicle, very close to a production model. Demonstration  Limited production of the vehicle being tested by the manufacturer in a real-world application. Production  Available to the public.  7   Hybrid Electric Technology Light-Duty Vehicles Automotive manufacturers continue to work on hybrid technology, especially for the light-duty market. Second year sales of the two hybrids introduced in the U.S. market, the Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight, were higher than in 2000. Sales of the Toyota Prius increased by 40% versus 2000. Sales of the Prius passed 14,000 units since its introduction in July 2000. Sales of the Honda Insight were up 25% versus 2000 totals, totaling 4,726 during 2001. Table 5 lists the hybrid vehicles in production, as well as the most recent vehicles introduced in the past few years. (For more information on these and other light-duty hybrid vehicles introduced around the world, refer to the companion tables on the Internet.) Several new hybrid vehicles have been developed and introduced in the past year and more are reaching the market. The Honda Civic HEV is planned to go on sale in spring of 2002. As Honda's second hybrid vehicle to market, the Civic is expected to do well. Ford's hybrid version of their popular Escape SUV is expected to hit the market in early 2003. Notable examples of hybrids announced in the past year include the General Motors (GM) Silverado/Sierra pickup, the Daihatsu UFE, and the Toyota ES3. GM's HEV Sierra is expected to be the first hybrid available as a full size truck. Designed with the full power and towing capacity of a typical truck, the HEV Sierra is expected to have approximately 20% better fuel economy. GM plans to produce the truck for the 2004 model year (MY). Daihatsu introduced its UFE (Ultra Fuel Economy) at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2001. This ultra-light four-seat coupe uses a direct injection gasoline engine and achieves 129 mpg. Toyota introduced the ES3 sedan at the Frankfort Auto Show in September of 2001. The ES3 (Eco Spirit Cubic) uses a 1.4 liter, direct injection, turbo diesel engine that achieves 88 mpg. The vehicle runs on ultra low sulfur diesel and employs the latest catalytic converter technology to reduce both NOx and PM. The hybrid system on this vehicle uses ultracaps to capture braking energy. Table 5.

The past two years has seen an increase in numbers of heavy-duty vehicles on order. According to the APTA 2001 Vehicle Databook, there were 42 hybrid buses in active service as of January 1, 2001, with more than 400 on order and a potential for approximately 100 more. Table 6 lists some of the more significant heavy vehicle projects. DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies and the Field Operations Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) are conducting an evaluation of New York City Transit's hybrid buses. The results are expected to be released in early 2002 through the AFDC Web site at www.afdc.doe.gov, or by calling 1800-423-1DOE.  9   Table 6.

The majority of fuel cell projects to date use transit buses. Table 8 lists projects involving fuel cell heavy vehicles, including projects underway in Europe. For a more complete list of heavy-duty fuel cell projects, see the companion tables at www.ott.doe.gov/otu/field_ops/prog_info.html. Several U.S. transit agencies are in the process of procuring fuel cell buses for demonstration programs required by the California Air Resources Board. AC Transit of Oakland, Calif., and SunLine Transit Agency of Thousand Palms, Calif., are finalizing plans to order several fuel cell buses for this demonstration. DOE through NREL is working with both agencies to evaluate this new technology. Table 8.

Of note are: California Air Resources Board (CARB) Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate  In January 2001, CARB adopted a credit program to provide OEMs extra credit for placing ZEVs before the required date of the ruling. This was to encourage early placement of EVs into the market. The credit program would give an automaker multiple credits for selling small neighborhood electric vehicles prior to the start of the ruling. Concerns were made that these credits would allow an OEM to meet their mandate without selling a fullscale EV. In December of 2001, CARB modified the ruling to limit how auto manufacturers use advance credits to offset actual ZEV sales. CARB also announced that SUV, minivan, and pickup sales would count toward the baseline calculation of each OEMs vehicle sales. This means that the total number of EVs required by the mandate will be larger that previously expected. Studies Link Pollution to Birth Defects and Asthma  Several studies released in 2001 show evidence of health effects of vehicular pollution. A study released by University of California-Los Angeles in December showed a link between air quality and infant birth defects. This article was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. Results from another study by the University of California-Davis supports the idea that asthma in children and adults might be related to living in areas with poor air quality. Studies such as these could lead to increased air quality legislation. CLEAR ACT Introduced  A bill was introduced to Congress to spur the use of vehicles that operate on alternative fuels as well as efficient advanced automotive technology. The Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies or CLEAR ACT would give credits to purchase efficient automobiles, such as fuel cell and hybrids; credits for AFVs; credits for alternative fuel use; and credits for installation of residential or retail fueling infrastructure.  Summary The focus, direction, and funding of transportation programs and the marketplace for advanced technologies is continually changing and developing. Understanding these trends within the context of today's marketplace is critical to focusing public and private resources where they can have the most impact. Key points from this document include:        The gap between U.S. consumption and production of petroleum is widening at the rate of 4.5% per year (average from 1985 through 2001). Light-duty trucks and automobiles continue to be the major consumer with respect to transportation energy use. Alternative fuel use continues to increase by 4% each year. This is insignificant compared to the increasing gap between production and consumption of petroleum. The number of alternative fuel stations increased by 4.4% versus the previous year. There is significantly more development in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle markets. Fuel cells and hydrogen appear to be the vision of the future from the auto industry perspective.  12   13   Appendix  14   Table A.

In this guest letter, she explains the purpose behind Clean Cities International. Dear Readers: I will never forget the first time I landed in Delhi, air was foggy and oppressive. I'm not often bothered as we loaded my luggage into a taxi. As we made our children living on the streets with very little shelter; greenery; and streets congested by noisy three-wheel India in July of 2000. It was late, and the by allergies, but my throat and eyes burned way to the hotel, I could see women and cows eating what seemed to be the last bit of rickshaws.  My first thought was, ""What am I doing here? These people still need the basics--food, shelter, and clean water."" Their plight seemed overwhelming, and my mission inconsequential. But soon I realized that everyone, irrespective of caste or station in life, needs clean air. And yes, the Clean Cities Program can play a part in improving life in the developing world. Since then, I've returned to Delhi on several occasions, often accompanied by trainers and technical experts from the United States. Our mission has been to help establish a safe, clean fueling infrastructure in India, and much progress has been made. Delhi itself has taken bold steps toward that end, such as converting its own bus fleet to CNG. The city has announced plans to join us as an international partner. Clean recently, extreme tionship Cities International has made inroads in other developing nations including, most Bangladesh. India's neighbor to the east is similarly poor, crowded, and burdened by levels of air pollution. We've conducted CNG training in Dhaka, and a partnering relawith that city is set to begin this year (see page 10 for details.)  We've conducted reverse trade missions in this country, welcoming foreign delegates to educational and networking events such as the World NGV Conference and our own annual convention. We've established valuable relationships with developed nations as well. (Read the latest about our relationship with CIVITAS, the bold environmental initiative of the European Union, on page 15.) We recently hosted a conference Upcoming on LPG for vehicular use in Mexico City.  Conferences and Events 9th Annual National Ethanol Conference February 3-6, 2004 Washington, D.C.

In the Philippines, for example, an interagency agreement between USAID and DOE is crafted in part to help develop ways to make biodiesel from domestic coconut oil. Why do we do it? The second most important reason, perhaps, is business development. Cultivating interest in alterative fuels abroad generates business for countless U.S. companies. Providers of fuel, dispensers, pipelines, and engineering services have already benefited from our efforts. To my knowledge, there is no other program to help the developing world systematically build safe and effective alternative fuel vehicle programs. The most important reason for our international efforts is more fundamental. We are all part of this beautiful planet, connected in so many ways. Developing nations need not just technical and financial support. They need friends. Gandhi said, ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" I am grateful that this notion is embraced by so many people connected with the Clean Cities Program, both here and throughout the world.  10th National Clean Cities Conference May 25, 2004 Ft.

The opening of public alternative fueling stations used to be big news. Unveiling new sites called for ribbon-cutting, balloons, and speeches, as supporters turned out to cheer the first fill-up with any non-petroleum fuel. Even adding E85 or biodiesel pumps at gasoline stations was often a cause for celebration. In what can only be considered a success for alternative fuels, it's no longer that way. Grand openings don't always accompany expansion of the local infrastructure, says Yvonne Anderson, coordinator of the Central Oklahoma Clean Cities coalition. ""It has become more commonplace,"" she says. The coalition still deploys PR tactics when new stations open around Oklahoma City. But often they're merely a hook to solicit media coverage of alternative fuels in general. Growth in alternative fuels is evident to users of DOE's Alternative Fuel Station Locator (visit the Alternative Fuel Data Center at www.afdc.doe.gov and click on Refueling Sites). Its database is updated regularly. Most fuel types logged net gains in the 12-month period ending on October 31, 2003. Sellers of natural gas (especially CNG) were the exception, showing net declines during the 12-month period. While natural gas volume has risen steadily, the number of stations nationwide has fallen due to industry consolidation (more on page 6). PIX 12827  The Dakota Ridge RV Center can supply propane for vehicle use as well as camping, says attendant Garland Wright. Top: Amigo Oil's Phillips 66 station in Santa Fe, New Mexico celebrated the addition of E85 fueling with a grand opening in July.

Because vehicle fueling is often a smaller portion of their business, these propane stations have sometimes been difficult to identify through the years. In the past year, special attention has been given to identifying all LPG vendors, resulting in many newly identified stations. More than 4,000 propane vendors are now listed the station locator database.  *Includes both new stations and stations newly identified  4   A small but growing part of the LPG business offers modern, convenient, credit card-enabled fuel dispensers at major brand service stations. Many are part of the CleanFUEL USA Network, which includes stations in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Montana. A key player in that network is Clean Fueling Technologies, a dispenser manufacturer headed by Curtis Donaldson. With help from a grant from the state of Texas, the company plans to build six LPG stations along the 80-mile corridor between Austin and San Antonio. Austin is also the site of a new, modern LPG station serving the city's airport. The state-of-the-art station was financed with grants from the city of Austin and the Propane Education and Research Council. It is used both by private motorists and airport vehicles, including a fleet of 29 shuttle buses. The station will dispense 1.3 million gallons of fuel per year, including 300,000 gallons of new sales. It is expected to be open by January 2004.  HELP WANTED Updating the Database It's a big job maintaining the database that serves the Alternative Fuel Station Locator and Route Mapper. Existing data is verified annually, but many stations open, and some close, every day. Information about new sites comes from a variety sources including fuel trade associations, station owners and operators, press releases, and media coverage. Our best allies in the quest, however, are private individuals who use alternative fuels. The Clean Cities Program urges AFV drivers to let us know when a new station opens or an old one closes, or when you spot inaccuracies in our data. Call the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE. For new stations, fill out the Refueling Stations Submission Form at www.afdc.doe.gov/refuel/stations_add.html.  Biodiesel The nation's biodiesel infrastructure expanded considerably during the 12-month period, adding a net total of 93 stations. Of those 93, thirteen are private sites operated by a single entity--the North Carolina Department of Transportation, which has prioritized biodiesel use in recent years. Biodiesel is growing rapidly both among consumers and in EPAct-regulated fleets. In the nation's State & Alternative Fuel Provider fleets alone, biodiesel use rose from less than 1 million gallons in 2001 to 2.66 million gallons in 2002. Kelly Feil operates Click's Kicks 66, a modern Phillips station, in Boise, Idaho. Feil was asked by the state's Department of Water Resources to participate in a one-year biodiesel pilot program. The station hadn't sold diesel before, but it designated one tank and dispenser for B20. Now it sells 400-500 gallons per day. Waste management company BFI is an excellent customer, using the fuel in trash trucks. Several individuals buy it too. ""People think it's great,"" says Feil. The interest of private motorists rises noticeably when prices drop. Feil's station has one big advantage, he says. It is Idaho's only retail seller of biodiesel. Twenty miles from Boulder, Colorado is the town of Rollinsville. Barely a wide spot in the road, it has one restaurant, a post office, and the Rollinsville Country Store. Sold along with food and fishing tackle are five-gallon containers of B100 biodiesel fuel. The price is $13.75. Customers may borrow a funnel and fill up on-site, or take the jug home. ""We make three or four sales a week,"" says Christine Gellatly, who owns and operates the store with her husband. Customers include construction workers driving diesel pickup trucks and locals commuting to Boulder in passenger cars. ""They buy it for environmental reasons, and they usually say something about reducing imported oil,"" says Gellatly. The store's fuel comes from Boulder Biodiesel, a member-owned cooperative that obtains the fuel from a distributor for Iowa-based West Central Soy.  Government agencies such as the National Park Service, with diesel buses serving Yellowstone, aren't the only consumers of biodiesel fuel. A growing grassroots movement of motorists is served by small sellers such as Christine Gellatly at the Rollinsville Country Store. National Park Service/PIX 12854  5  PIX 12847   Station Stories E85 The nation's corn belt is best known for ethanol production and E85 fueling. But E85 has established roots in at least 26 states, thanks in part to grants from the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition (NEVC). Nationwide, stations selling E85 experienced a net gain of 30 in the one-year period ending in October.  - continued  In its first few weeks, E85 sales were modest--fewer than 200 gallons per week. But public interest in the fuel was quite strong, says Richard Mason of Renewable Energy Partners. ""People in Santa Fe are environmentally conscious,"" he says. Signage on the dispensers is so attractive, says Mason, that it has drawn much interest from motorists, including those driving gasoline-only vehicles. The station has had to devise ways to discourage people from buying E85 if their cars can't handle it. Mason's organization is working with car dealers in Santa Fe to expand sales of used flexible-fuel vehicles, with an online marketplace at www.renewableenergypartners.org. A second E85 station in Santa Fe, at a more central location, will also sell B20. NEVC grants also helped pay for E85 fueling at several Acorn Fuel Store sites in Colorado. ""Most of the people buying E85 are repeat customers,"" says company operations manager Tom Mousaw. ""I know there are a lot of other people who have flexible fuel vehicles and don't know it,"" he says.  Natural Gas While other fuels move toward more diversified forms of distribution, natural gas sites seem to be moving toward ownership by fewer, stronger operators. The number of CNG and LNG stations experienced a combined net decline of 193 during the 12-month period. Many of the closed ""stations,"" however, were private, slow-fill units operated by utility companies. Some see the decline as a nationwide ""right-sizing"" of the sector. Many stations were ill fated from the start, says Jim Harger of California-based Clean Energy Fuels. Utility companies have often focused on municipal fleets  6  Alternative Fuels Vehicle Network/PIX 12856  An E85 dispenser now serves customers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at a Phillips 66 station owned by Amigo Oil. E85 fueling was added as part of a complete overhaul of the site, which was celebrated with a grand opening in July. An NEVC grant for the E85 dispenser was secured by Renewable Energy Partners, a nonprofit organization that also engineered the installation. The fuel is blended in Albuquerque with ethanol from Archer Daniels Midland, which delivers it by truck from the Midwest.  A net reduction in the number of CNG facilities nationwide stems from industry consolidation. Fewer, bigger sites--such as this Clean Energy Fuels station in Phoenix--have replaced many smaller ones. Below: At Amigo Oil's modern Phillips station in Santa Fe, attractive signage helps create a mainstream image for E85.  Clean Energy Fuels/PIX 12855   Of the 90 Costco stores in California, approximately 68 offer EV charging. That state has adopted conductive charging as a standard, but Costco still provides paddle-type inductive chargers as well, for cars such as GM's EV1. The service is provided to customers at ""no charge.""  or individual consumers, with disappointing sales results. Successful natural gas stations must focus on serving large ""anchor tenants"" such as waste management companies. ""Without an anchor tenant, the station doesn't make sense,"" says Harger. Station closing details from the 12-month period confirm Harger's observation. Eleven stations operated in Ohio by East Ohio Gas were confirmed closed. Northern Indiana Public Service closed 10 NiSource stations in Indiana. Consolidation of ownership is another factor in the net decline in natural gas station totals. Clean Energy Fuels has acquired certain chains of stations, including the Denverbased Natural Fuels sites. Some underperforming sites were closed in the process. Those that remain are bigger, better situated, and dispensing more fuel than ever per station and in total. Although the number of natural gas fueling sites may have dropped, sales of the fuel nationwide are rising steadily. CNG and LNG sales in 2002 reached 113 million gasoline gallons equivalent (gge). That's an increase of 1.5 percent over the previous year. The 2002 total is up 74 percent from the 1997 total of 65 million gge.  The true total is much higher than that, says Enid Joffe of the Clean Fuel Connection, a company that installs the stations. Perhaps 2,000 chargers are in California alone, without even counting residential installations, she says. Public chargers have been put in parking garages, shopping centers, and airports. Many were installed with public funds and are available for use free of charge. Non-public sites are found at schools, military bases, government agencies, and utility companies. EV charging is one of several forms of alternative fueling available to the public at San Diego's new Regional Transportation Center. (The state-of-the art RTC also sells biodiesel, natural gas, LPG, and E85 along with gasoline and low-sulfur diesel. See AFN 7-2, page 16.) Its EV chargers are free for public use, and usually all six are open, said an attendant. One regular customer has been known to settle in for a nap while fueling his Ford Ranger. A member of the San Diego Clean Fuels Coalition plugs in her Ford TH!NK City while conducting business at the RTC. EV drivers in California can charge their vehicles at approximately 68 of the 90 Costco sales warehouses in the state. Costco charging sites include both inductive and conductive chargers, with two to six plug-ins per location. EV charging is free to Costco members. ""We consider it a logical, valuable service we can offer. When people come to one of our warehouses, they usually stay a while,"" says Ed Fitzgerald, director of automobile-related sales for the company. EV charging at Costco is neither on the increase nor declining, says Fitzgerald. ""The automakers aren't offering electric vehicles any more, but there are still quite a few of them on the road in California."" Outside of that state, EV charging is available at a few Costco sites in Georgia and Arizona. ""Generally, we've put them where the vehicles are,"" he says.  EV Charging The sale of new, fully street-capable all-electric vehicles in the United States has essentially stopped, at least temporarily, with the discontinuation of Toyota's RAV4-EV and Ford's line of TH!NK cars. But many ""production"" EVs and smaller neighborhood electric vehicles remain on the road, with the highest concentration in California. The 12-month period ending in October brought a net addition of 36 EV charging sites, raising the total known nationwide to 875.  Costco/PIX 12826  7   Clubs and co-ops are focusing demand on select stations, buying fuel in bulk, and helping to reshape the market.  Biodiesel Buying Power Although fleets represent by far the biggest share of biodiesel fuel users nationwide, private motorists are a growing force in the biodiesel market. Motivated more by environmental concerns than by mandates, individuals are filling up at mainstream service stations whenever possible, and--when necessary--at more unlikely places such as industrial fuel sites, neighborhood grocery stores, and their own garages. To ensure a steady fuel supply, some biodiesel users have formed co-ops and informal buying groups. ""People are using a market mechanism to concentrate their buying power,"" says Gene Gebolys, president of the nation's largest biodiesel supplier, World Energy. Customers often promise their collective business to a single station, hoping to convince the operator it's worthwhile to dedicate a tank and dispenser to biodiesel. One such station is operated by Massachusetts-based Burke Oil. The company is engaged mainly in distributing petroleum fuel and lubricants to service stations operated by other companies. Its only proprietary station is located in Chelsea, near the headquarters of World Energy. Burke was asked both by World Energy and local owners of dieselfueled cars to consider selling biodiesel at retail. It started dispensing B20 from an unused kerosene tank in mid-2002. ""I had no idea how popular it would be,"" says Ted Burke, vice president of sales for Burke Oil. The station now has approximately 75 retail customers buying 2,500 gallons of B20 biodiesel per month. Sales are growing rapidly, he says. ""It's small compared to gasoline sales; not enough to build a business on,"" Burke admits. But demand has been strong enough for Burke Oil to install a new 2,000-gallon tank and dispenser strictly for biodiesel. The company also sells 150,000-200,000 gallons of biodiesel per year, delivered in bulk, to truck fleets.  Burke's retail customers include many enthusiast drivers of older diesel-powered Volkswagens. One is Nate Byrnes, a long-time biodiesel user who maintains a Web presence at BiodieselNow.com. Volkswagen does not endorse biodiesel use in the United States, however, and using it will void the manufacturer's new-car engine warranty. Diesel vehicles from other automakers include domestic pickup trucks and older Mercedes-Benz sedans. A comprehensive list of diesel vehicles made since 1960 is published at www.gobiodiesel.org/years.html.  Many biofueled diesel cars appeared at last year's opening of a biodiesel station in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Speakers included (from top) Gene Gebolys of World Energy, Ed Burke of Burke Oil, and biodiesel user Nate Byrnes. General Motors recently authorized blends up to B5, which is 5 percent biodiesel, for use in certain drivetrain configurations of 2004 model pickup trucks including the Chevrolet Silverado (below).  Wieck Photo Database  8  BiodieselNow.com/PIX 12857   Commercial biodiesel sales began in Boulder, Colorado with the September 2003 opening of a public B20 dispenser: From left: Bryan Flansburg and Paul Tabolt of the University of Colorado, Boulder Mayor Will Toor, and facility owner Joe Swank. The fuel comes from Blue Sun Biodiesel, a Coloradobased broker of biodiesel.  In the area around Chelsea and Boston, Byrnes says, Burke's station is the only retail site selling biodiesel. Before that facility went in, some diesel drivers were routinely taking four-hour Sunday trips to another supplier in Maine, returning with five-gallon containers filled with B100. Some still do that, he says, rather than settle for the B20 sold by Burke Oil. In areas of the country where biodiesel isn't available at retail, motorists have taken matters into their own hands by forming cooperatives. The Connecticut Biodiesel Co-op, based near Hartford, typically keeps about 300 gallons of fuel on hand for its members. The fuel is acquired from World Energy and sold to members ""at cost."" It is delivered in 30- and 55-gallon drums to locations within a two-hour driving distance. Another, similar co-op is established near Trenton, New Jersey. Home fueling and storage is a realistic option for many biodiesel users, says Dan Freeman, owner of Dr. Dan's Alternative Fuel Werks in Seattle, Washington. ""They don't have to rely on an established service station,"" he says. ""Biodiesel is not considered a hazardous material. It's no more dangerous than the vegetable oil in your kitchen."" Freeman offers 275-gallon tanks and electric pumps for sale to individuals and co-ops. (Visit www.fuelwerks.com.) He also sells biodiesel (as well as CNG) at his own location, where the primary business is auto repair. Biodiesel sales have been as high as 11,000 gallons per month, he says. ""In my first year, my customers tended to be techies who found me on the Web. Usually they came in knowing more about biodiesel than I did,"" he says. Since then, his customer base has broadened. Many are recent converts to the fuel. Some co-ops are personified more by community activists than auto enthusiasts. One is Colorado-based Boulder Biodiesel, which calls itself ""a coalition of environmental scientists, citizen activists, students and permaculture design consultants who advocate the use of biodiesel as  an alternative fuel source."" The co-op was instrumental in persuading a wholesale fuel distributor in Boulder to sell biodiesel at a public retail site, which opened for business in September 2003. Boulder Biodiesel offers education and technical assistance to its members, and is experimenting with fuel production using waste grease from local restaurants. Small producers aspiring to sell their own fuel face one important issue. Biodiesel sold commercially must meet ASTM D 6751, a quality standard defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials. To avoid the high costs of required testing, small-volume sellers usually purchase fuel for their members from larger distributors. All sellers, even small ones, are subject to motor fuel tax collection requirements. Grease Works is an Oregon-based co-op that started out with plans to make fuel from waste grease. It was later re-organized as a ""bulk buying club."" Members pay annual dues of $75, which entitles them to a discounted price on fuel purchases. Those who choose home storage get free delivery, storage drums, and hand-operated pumps. On its Web site, Grease Works bills itself as ""one of the most inspired grassroots organizations in the country."" (Visit www.greaseworks.org.) Grease Works gets its fuel from Sequential Fuels, a distributor for World Energy. To co-ops distributing biodiesel--even just to their own members--quality assurance is an important responsibility, says Linda Graham, coordinator of the Puget Sound Clean Cities Coalition. ""Ultimately we want biodiesel to seem normal to people. That won't happen unless it's handled properly by everyone in the chain."" The role of co-ops within Clean Cities is also important, she says. ""They're not for everybody, but they are definitely a step in the right direction. They're helping to expand alternative fuels beyond the realm of fleets, into the mainstream.""  9  City of Boulder/PIX 12825   Clean Cities International News BANGLADESH ASG Renaissance/PIX 12858  Clean Cities International advances CNG in Southeast Asia Clean Cities has taken steps to induct the People's Republic of Bangladesh as an international member.

But significant growth has occurred in other countries including India, Pakistan, and Egypt. Co-owner Tom Sewell, his brother, has visited Bangladesh to cultivate new business. Accompanying Rood on the year's first trip to Bangladesh, in August, were Greg Zilberfarb of ASG Renaissance; Leo Thomason of the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute; and Bill McGlinchey of AFV Consulting. One thing they noticed immediately, said Zilberfarb, was evidence of recent, rapid growth in CNG fueling. Thousands of three-wheel rickshaws and many other vehicles have been converted to CNG. Many fueling stations had already been built. ""The problem is that there are no standards,"" he said. ""It looks a lot like the U.S. in the 1980s."" The lack of standards for nozzles on fuel dispensers, for example, results in many mishaps. Generally these systems use a probe that must be held firmly in place during fueling, rather than the locking type used in developed countries. Usually the fit is sealed with an O-ring, but there is no universal diameter. Drivers have taken to carrying adapter kits to handle the array of fueling equipment they'll encounter, said Zilberfarb. ""But we witnessed many incidents where the O-ring blew right off the probe.""  stations in Bangladesh tend to be undersized and inappropriately designed, with compressors that aren't up to the task. The equipment fails frequently, and many vehicles leave the station with their tanks only partially filled. Codes and standards were the subjects of talks in August between McGlinchey and Bangladesh officials including the Chief Inspector of Explosives, charged with enforcing safety codes pertaining to fueling stations. His advice was to ""look toward the future,"" and consider adopting international standards now in development at the United Nations or ISO 9000 standards from the International Organization for Standardization. The year's second mission to Bangladesh was in October, this time with the specific purpose of training. Thomason and Zilberfarb conducted a three-day course on CNG fueling station sizing and design. Attending the course were approximately 35 entrepreneurs and public officials. What they found most interesting, said Thomason, were discussions of fueling station design options, fuel, quality, and temperature compensation. Also covered were techniques for sizing critical station components, and strategies to reduce long lines of vehicles waiting to fill up. The October training was just a start, said Thomason. ""We plan to develop and implement a long-term selfsustaining program in which trainers in Bangladesh will be able to educate designers, construction companies, mechanics, and station operators about the critical elements of fueling station sizing, design, operation, and maintenance."" Accompanying the train-the-trainer campaign will be course curriculum development to facilitate skill transfer about building and equipping appropriate CNG fueling facilities. For general information on Bangladesh, visit www.usaid.gov/bd/bangladesh.html.  Long Lines Filling stations in the country are plagued by long lines of cars. The push to increase the number of CNG stations nationwide has resulted in perhaps 2,000 permits for new stations, said Zilberfarb. Many were granted to entrepreneurs with no experience in the design, installation, and maintenance of high-pressure fueling equipment.

The annual event is a showcase for vehicles powered by advanced technology and alternative fuels, with competition in performance, emissions, noise, and crash safety. This year's event drew greater participation by large trucks such as the Freightliner Century Class Day Cab trailer (foreground), as well as buses. A pleasant surprise this year, says the sponsor, was the ability of some commercialsize vehicles to achieve excellent results with zero emissions. Michelin  Hybrids lead Fuel Economy Guide ratings All three hybrid-powered passenger cars sold in the United States rank best in their classes for fuel economy, according to the ratings published by the federal government. The figures appeared in the 2004 edition of the Fuel Economy Guide, released in October by DOE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Honda's hybrid Insight and Civic, respectively, now top the two-seater and compact car categories. The Insight earned the best fuel economy status among all cars, rated at 60 mpg in city driving and 66 on the highway. The Toyota Prius, another hybrid, ranks best among mid-size cars. BMW's gasoline-fueled Mini-Cooper takes top honors in the category of mini-compact cars. Other category leaders include the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Focus Wagon, Ford Ranger, and two diesel-fueled Volkwagens--the Jetta Wagon and New Beetle--when equipped with five-speed manual transmissions. The guide rates vehicles for all available engine and transmission configurations. AFVs are grouped together among others of the same fuel-type. A special section provides information on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and lists the Honda FCX as only fuel cell vehicle certified for emissions by EPA. Print copies of the guide will be available at auto dealerships, credit unions, and public libraries nationwide. It is available in its entirety online at www.fueleconomy.gov.  General Motors recently unveiled a new diesel-electric hybrid drivetrain for use in transit buses, and simultaneously announced the purchase of 235 buses so-equipped in transit districts serving Seattle, Washington. Using the buses will save 750,000 gallons of fuel annually, say officials of the King County and Puget Sound transit agencies. The 60-foot articulated buses are made by New Flyer, and are driven by a parallel-hybrid system from GM Allison Electric Drives. Compared to the diesel-powered buses they are replacing in Seattle, the new buses produce 90 percent lower particulate emissions and 60 percent fewer emissions of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen, GM says. The buses deliver superior torque, with dual electric motors that launch the vehicle from a stop. Using hybrid drives in buses is part of a GM strategy to focus fuel-saving technology where it is needed most. Replacing a conventional bus with a hybrid saves as much fuel as replacing 40 passenger cars with hybrids, the company says. The new GM Allison  drive system is compatible with contemporary vehicle architecture, and can be used in non-articulated buses, suburban coaches, military vehicles, and medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The system is in pilot programs in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Portland, Houston, Salt Lake City; Austin, Texas; Hartford, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; and Orange County, California.  12  General Motors/PIX 12861  Seattle adopts GM transit buses   Federal News On the Rise Trading of EPAct credits by State & Alternative Fuel Provider fleets has risen steadily along with their AFV acquisition rates A key feature of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 was the ramping up of its vehicle acquisition requirements. State & Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) fleets were mandated to gradually increase their annual AFV purchase rates, topping out at 90 percent for fuel providers and 75 percent for state fleets.  Credit Trading Activity 35 30 Number of Trades 25 20 15 10 5 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Credits Traded Trades 1,400 1,200 Credits Traded 1,000 800 600 400 200 0  EPAct also created a credit system to reward fleets that comply early or exceed their requirements. The system is designed for flexibility, allowing fleets with excess credits to sell them to others that fall short. Credit-trading has proliferated among S&FP fleets. It has ramped up in correlation with the required AFV acquisition rates. The table above outlines the steady ascent of credit trading since 1999. It would be too modest, however, to attribute the rise in credit trading strictly to escalating AFV requirements, says DOE Alternative Fuel Transportation Program regulatory manager Linda Bluestein. ""We're doing more to engage the fleet managers, to help them understand and meet their obligations."" Such help includes contacting fleets directly and publishing an annual report. Also provided are an ongoing newsletter for stakeholders, and updates to the S&FP section of the EPAct site at www.ott.doe.gov/epact/ state_fleets.shtml. Bluestein's office consults directly with fleet managers on matters of regulatory compliance. EPAct credits apply only to covered S&FP fleets, not to federal fleets. Nationwide, about 300 S&FP entities are affected. ""We get calls from corporate fleet managers and even private individuals saying, `I bought an AFV. Can I sell the credit to someone?' We tell them, `Not unless you're part of an eligible state or fuel provider fleet.'"" Independent brokers are allowed to facilitate trades if both parties are eligible. For most eligible fleets, credit selling isn't an everyday occurrence. ""Fleets that have exceeded their requirements usually bank their credits,"" says Bluestein. Credits can be saved up for use in future years, in case the fleet's AFV acquisition efforts don't make the grade in the future. Dozens of fleets have accumulated excess credits  in this fashion. Those interested in selling are listed at www.ott.doe.gov/epact/progs/public_rpt.cgi. Credit trading represents DOE's intent to be ""flexible"" in enforcing EPAct mandates, Bluestein says. ""Some fleets aren't in a position to comply as easily as others, maybe because a certain fuel isn't available locally or they can't arrive at exactly the right vehicle mix."" One fleet operator that has sold credits frequently is KeySpan Energy. The New York-based utility is one of the nation's largest distributors of natural gas. A company policy says its light-duty vehicle acquisitions must be limited to CNG vehicles. As a result, it typically accumulates hundreds of credits per year. KeySpan was involved in at least six trades in a one-year period ending in August 2003. The smallest was the sale of a single credit. The largest was the sale of a 332 credits to TXU Corporation, an investorowned, publicly traded utility based in Dallas. Credit selling is considered ""a way to help other utilities and state fleets meet their mandates,"" says Carolyn Mackin, a KeySpan employee who negotiates trades with buyers. It is also a welcome source of revenue. According to industry sources, trades have been negotiated in a range ""from the hundreds to the thousands"" of dollars per credit. Representing TXU in trades with KeySpan was John Matlack. That company has bought more than 450 credits (all from KeySpan) in the past three years. ""We've also directly acquired most types of AFVs including CNG, propane, electric vehicles, and even hybrids, and used them in our fleet where it made good sense,"" says Matlack. The company's compliance strategy also includes using biodiesel. Buying EPAct credits ""helps us meet our mandates in an economically feasible way,"" he says.  13   Clean Cities Roundup Other stakeholders include the cities of Lansing, East Lansing, St. John, and the St. John School District. Lansing leads the coalition, contracting with Wolfe, a retired mechanical engineer, to be its full-time coordinator. The September designation ceremony was attended by Douglas Faulkner, DOE Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. GLCCC/PIX 12862  Douglas Faulkner of DOE (standing, right) presents a plaque to Lansing Mayor Tony Benavides at the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition designation ceremony. Seated (from left) are Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey; Vincent Parish, Michigan Dept.of Agriculture; Bob Swanson, Michigan Dept. of Consumer and Industry Services; Doug Dittrich, General Motors; Jody Pollock, Michigan Corn Growers Association; and Jim Sygo, Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality.  Salt Lake coalition wins Clean School Bus USA grant The Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition was named one of 17 recipients of this year's Clean School Bus USA grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The $350,000 grant will help a large school district replace many of its oldest diesel-powered buses with CNG-fueled buses. The grant resulted from a community service project by students from the University of Utah. An application was drafted with guidance from coordinator Beverly Miller. Their approach was to ""tell a compelling story on the very first page of the proposal,"" says Miller. ""Give the readers a reason to want to read on, a reason to see just how you propose to do what the story says."" A CNG bus typically costs $35,000 more than a diesel bus--approximately $110,000 versus $75,000. The $350,000 grant amount will pay the incremental cost of 10 buses fueled by CNG. The buses will go to the Jordan School District, which already has 20 CNG buses obtained in large part with DOE support. Clean School Bus USA is a cost-shared grant program administered by EPA. Congress authorized $5 million of the agency's budget to assist school districts in upgrading their bus fleets. This year's grant competition drew more than 120 applications requesting nearly $60 million in funds. The chosen projects will demonstrate a variety of ways to reduce pollution from school buses, and will remove more than 200,000 pounds of diesel particulate matter from the air in the next 10 years, according to EPA.  New coalition takes root in Michigan The Clean Cities Program's newest coalition includes Michigan's capital city, Lansing, and other nearby communities. Stakeholders of the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition gathered for an official designation ceremony on the steps of the State Capitol in September. The Lansing-based group itself is not new, says coordinator Bill Wolfe. For seven years, members have worked to implement alternative fuels and AFVs in central Michigan. Approximately 135,000 gallons of non-petroleum fuels are sold annually in the area. Approximately half of the total is LPG. The other half consists mostly of biodiesel and a small amount of E85. After seeking Clean Cities status on two previous occasions, the group succeeded this year by demonstrating substantial local support for alternative fuels. Stakeholders of the coalition include car dealers, fuel suppliers, a utility company, a transit district, several state and local agencies, the American Lung Association, and Michigan State University. Lansing Community College, another stakeholder, offers an AFV technician degree program.  CNG Bookmobile Seattle's vehicle fleet includes more than 200 natural gas vehicles including, most recently, a CNG-fueled bookmobile. Operated by the Seattle Public Library, the bookmobile travels to daycare centers, retirement homes, and nursing facilities, bringing books to people who can't travel because of age, disability, or illness. Funding was provided in part by the Puget Sound Clean Cities Coalition, leveraging a grant from DOE's State Energy Program. With a John Deere natural gas engine installed on a chassis from Thomas Built Buses, the bookmobile is part of Seattle's Clean Green Fleet Action Plan, an initiative to implement alternative fuels and improve fuel economy in the city fleet.

In five years of involvement with the program, Russell-Story first helped lead Northeast Ohio's coalition to its Clean Cities designation in 1999, then became coordinator of a coalition serving the state of Vermont. As part of the honor, she was dispatched to this year's annual meeting of CIVITAS. (Europe's sweeping clean-transport initiative was profiled in the previous edition of AFN; visit http://afdcweb.nrel.gov/pdfs/afn7_2.pdf#civitas.) Following is Russell-Story's report from the October meeting, held in Graz, Austria. CIVITAS stands for CIty-VITAlity-Sustainability, and by definition it is much broader in scope than the Clean Cities Program. Partner cities in CIVITAS promote alternative fuels within larger program goals such as reducing the use of single-occupancy vehicles, expanding mass transit, and encouraging pedestrian and bicycle traffic in neighborhoods and urban centers. During my visit to Graz, that obvious difference between the two programs was pointed out to me by several CIVITAS coordinators. And in general, they expect their integrated approach to be more successful in addressing issues of air quality, petroleum dependence, and city livability. To me, the CIVITAS partner cities do seem to be experiencing tremendous success in AFV market penetrationespecially considering that the program has existed for only a few years. For example, Berlin has put more than 80 CNG taxis on the road in just two years. That's impressive progress toward a goal of 300 CNG taxis citywide. Germany already has 350 CNG fueling stations. Stockholm is the standout example in my opinion. The city has buses running on ethanol that's produced in Sweden. It also has an ambitious plan to make biogas from city wastewater. When that project is complete, the inner city ethanol buses will move to the suburbs while the new biogas buses go into use in the city center. While CIVITAS cities have some enviable successes, however, they are also experiencing challenges that may sound familiar. Rotterdam has had problems with prototype vehicles, and it now uses only more mature technologies. Rome remains committed to electric vehicles, but electric transit buses greatly outnumber privately owned EVs. Nantes and other cities have had difficulties persuading automakers to produce the kinds of vehicles that stakeholders want. Meanwhile, automakers attending the October conference expressed concerns about low AFV sales volume. Some CIVITAS participants are asking the European Commission to define alterative fuels and ""clean fuels,"" and to facilitate communication about product availability with the auto industry. Fuel neutrality is an issue within CIVITAS, as in Clean Cities. But some stakeholders believe Europe should focus on just one fuel. It was striking to see both the similarities and the differences between CIVITAS and Clean Cities. Erin Russell-Story I was equally impressed by the desire of CIVITAS partners to share their ideas, strategies, and experiences with their American counterparts. They urged me to take home the message of multi-modalism; expand Clean Cities to include all forms of transportation. But they were also very eager to learn about the use of AFVs in our country. Several CIVITAS coordinators hope to attend the 2004 Clean Cities Conference next May in Ft. Lauderdale. I urge Clean Cities stakeholders at our conference to seek out CIVITAS representatives and spend as much time with them as possible. I would also encourage DOE to remain in close contact with the European Commission, to jointly address issues facing both programs. Together, the two programs represent a much larger vehicle market. Thanks to DOE for the opportunity to represent Clean Cities abroad, and to learn more about Europe's impressive clean transportation initiative. Participants in both programs have a great deal to learn from each other. Air quality and petroleum dependence are global concerns, and creating a cross-Atlantic alliance may produce global solutions.

A demo of the vehicle was given to funding agencies and about 30 U.S. legislators. Billed as a ""low-emission shuttle bus of the future,"" it is expected to be manufactured with several optional engines. Natural gas fueling is planned, and other alternative fuels including propane, ethanol, and biodiesel are being considered. With the look and feel of traditional Yellowstone buses, the new vehicle design features ""theatre seating"" sloped downward from back to front. Seating options would accommodate 18 to 32 passengers. The floor is low for easy entry and exit, with a ramp to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A retractable roof would allow greater outdoor visibility. Snow tracks might be developed for winter mobility. Collaborating in its development are DOE's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), the Federal Transit Administration, and the National Park Service. Strong support for the project comes from the Greater Yellowstone/Teton Clean Cities Coalition, which has an equally strong interest in clean transportation, according to coordinator Sharon Roh. The coalition encompasses parts of three states, with two national parks and several cities connected by interstate highway corridors. Prospects are good for use beyond Yellowstone, says INEEL project leader Kerry Klingler. ""While the development of the prototype is the result of a need by the National Park Service for a yearround transit vehicle that could be used for park operations, market analysis indicates the vehicle will have broad application in municipal transit and privatesector transportation as well.""

Honda Releases New Civic Hybrid in Japan  Honda Motor Corporation announced the release of a new five-passenger, gasoline-electric hybrid sedan that went on sale by select Japanese Honda Primo dealers in mid December. Building on the hybrid technology developed for the Insight, the new sedan features an improved version of the Honda Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) System, which enables the vehicle to achieve an ultra-high fuel economy of 29.5km/L. Environmentally friendly, this Civic hybrid sedan has been certified as an Ultra Low-Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. Details on the release of the hybrid Civic sedan in the United States are still pending.  Full Story .    Toyota Announces Sale of RAV4-EV to California Retail Customers  Beginning in February 2002, California retail customers will be able to purchase Toyota's zero-emissions RAV4 electric vehicle (EV) at local car dealerships. This zero-emission version of Toyota's popular compact sport utility vehicle is powered by a rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery and permanent magnet motor that enables it to travel up to 78 mph with a maximum range of 80 to 100 miles per charge. It will be the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) electric vehicle to be sold to retail customers.      The decision to sell the RAV4-EV to the general public in California resulted from the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2001 passage of the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate. This legislation requires 10% of all new vehicle sold in the state to meet low emissions standards and 2% of the new vehicle purchases to be zero emission cars.      Toyota began leasing the RAV4-EV to select corporations and utilities in 1997. Today, there are approximately 900 electric RAV4s in service nationwide, including 700 on California roads. The RAV4-EV will have a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $42,000 but a $9,000 CARB incentive and $3,000 IRS credit should bring the price of the vehicle and in-home charging device down to about $31,000.

Ford and Toyota Engage in Talks to Produce Joint Hybrid Vehicle  America's Ford Motor Company and Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation are discussing plans to develop a new hybrid electric gasoline vehicle that would be produced in North America. Both companies would benefit from the increased economies of scale that joint production would bring, because developing hybrid technology is extremely expensive. For example, Toyota began producing the hybrid-electric Prius subcompact in June of 2000, but continues to loose money on the sale of these vehicles despite record demand for them.     Both companies share a commitment to increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. Ford is a key industry participant in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and has pledged to improve the fuel economy of its sport-utility vehicles up to 25% by 2005. Toyota's experience developing fuel-efficient hybrid technology for the Prius could help Ford to achieve this goal.    Talks between Toyota and Ford started in July of 2000 when former chief executive, Jacques Nasser met with Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. Dialog continues between the two companies with William Clay Ford Jr. now at the helm of the American automobile manufacturer. Both companies hope to clinch a deal on the joint hybrid-electric venture by the end of the year.        November 2001     Hyundai Fuel Cell Vehicle Wins Gold at Michelin Challenge Bibendum   The Hyundai Santa Fe fuel cell-powered sport utility vehicle took home two gold medals and two silver medals at the 2001  Michelin Challenge Bibendum  held at the California Speedway in Fontana, California on October 26th -29th. This four-day event has traditionally been an excellent opportunity for motor vehicle manufacturers to showcase the performance of near-term and long-range environmentally innovative automobiles and demonstrate their compatibility with driving performance, comfort, and safety. Competing automobiles were judged in nine individual categories including design, acceleration, braking, handling, slalom, fuel economy, range, noise level, and emissions. Participating as a member of the  California Fuel Cell Partnership , the Santa Fe fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) faired extremely well in its first North American vehicle competition, earning gold medals in the emissions and noise tests and silver medals in the slalom and fuel efficiency trials. A total of six hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles from various manufacturers were entered in the competition.           GM Announces Production of Full-Size Ethanol Pickups   To meet the increasing U.S. demand for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), General Motors (GM) announced it would begin production of a full-sized flex-fuel pickup truck that can run on E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), regular gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels. The flex-fuel option will now be available on 1,500 series Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks that have 5,300 Vortec engines. The new pickups will increase GM's existing line of ethanol vehicles, which includes sport-utility vehicles such as the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon, GMC Yukon XL, and Chevy Suburban, as well as smaller pickups like the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma.

OTT Releases 2002 Quality Metrics Report    Interested in how light- and heavy-duty alternative-fuel and advanced-technology vehicle programs will impact the future of our country? The U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technology (OTT) has just released its  2002 Quality Metric Report (PDF 1.6 MB) . The report discusses the potential emissions benefits, petroleum reductions, and economic impacts that 41 OTT-funded programs will have on the United States from 2001 until 2030. Light-duty vehicle technologies were evaluated for passenger automobiles and class 1 and 2 ""light"" trucks. These technologies included flexible fuel (ethanol/gasoline blends), electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, advanced diesel, natural gas, and stratified charge direct injection. Hybrid, natural gas, and advanced diesel technologies were evaluated for heavy-duty vehicles. Various analytical tools were used to develop the results. Each separate technology was analyzed according to when and how quickly the new technology could potentially enter the marketplace.         Maryland Opens First Ethanol Station   Many were on hand November 14 to celebrate the opening of Maryland's first public access ethanol fueling station. Located at 3240 Fort Meade Road (Rt. 198) in Laurel, Md., the Chevron station will dispense E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). Construction of the new station was made possible through a U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded to the Maryland Energy Administration.    An alternative fuel made from renewable resources, such as corn or biomass, ethanol has significant emissions benefits versus reformulated gasoline. Its use in flexible fuel vehicles can help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and increase our nation's energy security.       QUANTUM and ProCon Begin Production of Dedicated Propane Vans   QUANTUM Technologies WorldWide, Inc., and the Propane Promotion Consortium, Inc., (ProCon) announced that they will begin production on two models of dedicated propane vans. The only dedicated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vans available on the market, the G2500 passenger van and the G3500 cargo van will be certified ULEV (California ultra low emission vehicle) and ILEV (federal inherently low emission vehicle) and have a maximum range of about 250 miles. Production will begin immediately but there will be a two-month waiting period after orders are placed. Vans will be available through selected General Motors dealers nationwide. For more information, visit the  QUANTUM  Web site.     DOE's Regional Biomass Energy Program recently completed eight new  success story fact sheets  that are available on the RBEP Web site.      October 2001      Propane Truck Delivered to Bush Ranch   The  Propane Education and Research Council  recently funded the purchase and delivery of a propane-powered pickup truck to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.         The four-door, Ford F-250 truck features a liquid propane electronic fuel injection system manufactured by Bi-Phase Technologies.  Sleegers Engineering donated the truck's propane storage tank.  The propane conversion was conducted by Northwest      Propane.  Corken Pump, Manchester Tank, Marconi      Commerce Systems, and Star Tex plan to install a propane storage      facility and dispensing station on the Bush ranch.  Details .       U.S. Government Increases Commitment to American-Made Fuel  In a move designed to reduce America's dependence on imported petroleum, the Defense Energy Support Center recently awarded  World Energy  with the government's first-ever long-term contracts for biodiesel, a diesel fuel replacement derived from domestically produced vegetable oils.  World Energy's Envirodiesel will power vehicles and equipment in multiple fleets from different branches of the U.S. government, including the Postal Service, the Marines, the Air Force, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Agriculture.  Many municipalities, school systems, transit systems, and construction companies nationwide already use the fuel.      Announcing National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day Odyssey  April 11, 2002, is an exciting date for everyone in the clean air and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) arena. On that one day, an event held in multiple locations nationwide will be conducted to showcase cleaner choices in transportation--the National AFV Day Odyssey. Fleet managers, decision-makers, government officials, the automotive workforce, consumers, and others interested in AFVs will learn how AFVs are a positive choice in transportation.  For more information, go to the  National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day Odyssey Web site.     September 2001     New EPRI Study Indicates Consumers Favor Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles   A recent study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, California shows that consumers favor potential plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology because it offers savings on fuel and maintenance, use of an existing 120-volt infrastructure, and increased range over current gas electric hybrid vehicles.     Conventional HEVs such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius have fuel economies close to 42 mpg and rely on a gasoline engine to generate the electricity used to recharge the hybrid system's battery. The gasoline engine of the plug-in hybrid would be used more as a ""power-assist"" for long trips or on steep hills, and give the vehicle a fuel economy of up to 80 mpg. When fully charged, a plug-in HEV would act as a pure electric vehicle (EV) capable of traveling up to 60 miles daily in EV mode.    30 to 50 percent of the participants surveyed indicated that they would choose a plug-in HEV or non-plug HEV even if the car were priced 25 percent higher than a conventionally powered vehicle costing $19,000. 63 percent of those surveyed said they preferred plugging in an HEV at home because they could make use of a nearby 120-volt outlet.    Although there are no plug-in HEV models currently in production, the environmental and petroleum reduction benefits associated with these vehicles, along with the fact that they can be deployed with little to no change to the fueling infrastructure make them very attractive to both consumers and automakers.  Full Story .    Electric Trolleys to Grace Connecticut Streets  The city of New Haven recently unveiled its plan to create a new downtown shuttle service using four electric trolleys that will help shoppers get around the fragmented retail district.

RFA Vice President Confirms Ethanol Supply During Senate Energy Hearing   Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) Vice President Bob Dinneen met with members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week to assure committee members that the ethanol industry would be able to meet the oxygenate demand for reformulated gasoline in California. Early this year the state of California petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be waived from the gasoline oxygenate requirement mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990. The EPA later denied California's waiver request. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), currently used as an oxygenate additive in reformulated gasoline, is contaminating ground water supplies in California, as well as several other states. Using Ethanol instead of MTBE as an oxygenate blend in reformulated gasoline has many favorable benefits. Like MTBE, ethanol will increase octane and improve the emissions quality of gasoline, however ethanol is not harmful to the environment and is a renewable fuel. Blending ethanol with reformulated gasoline will also help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. During the meeting with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dinneen told members that 34 existing ethanol plants are undergoing expansion and eleven new plants are under construction. As a result, the ethanol industry expects to have an additional 300 million gallons of production capacity on line by the end of this year.

GX228-98-6365621	"III.3  MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE FUEL CELL PROGRAMS Perhaps the most encouraging observation about the ongoing efforts to develop automotive fuel  cell technology is that promising programs are being undertaken -- many of them collaboratively -- by four different types of organizations: industrial developers of fuel cell power plants with exclusive or major focus on PEM technology; a substantial number of generally smaller technical groups (in smaller and large companies) developing PEM fuel cell component, subsystem and system technologies; many of the leading automobile manufacturers; and key government agencies responsible for PEM fuel cell R&D, including among others DOE in the United States, the European Commission Directorates General for Science, Research and Development (No. XII) and Energy (No. XVII), and MITI/NEDO in Japan. Many of the smaller industrial groups mentioned above see automotive PEM fuel cells as a potentially major business opportunity and thus are investing some of their own development capabilities and resources, both in-house and jointly with fuel cell power plant developers and automobile manufacturers. Their programs and achievements were reviewed in Sections III.A and B, above. Section III.3 summarizes the government programs, and it reports on the programs of the major fuel cell developers and automobile manufacturers in more detail because of the essential role of these organizations in PEM automotive fuel cell power plant development and vehicle integration.  A.  GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS  United States As mentioned previously, the U.S. Department of Energy has been providing substantial support for the development of fuel cells for transportation applications through DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies. Much of this 10 year program has been focused on R&D to establish enabling technologies for the critical components of PEM automotive fuel cells. This R&D is being done under contracts with fuel cell developers and through substantial programs at DOE laboratories, mainly the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). From a modest program of basic research to overcome electrode catalyst performance and life limitations and improve fuel processing reactions, DOE's program expanded to include the development of high-performance PEM stack technology. Complementing the rapid evolution of PEM component and stack technologies in private-sector programs, DOE is continuing its selective support for the development of high-performance, potentially low-cost fuel cell components. The program also   has been supporting the development of gasoline fuel processing concepts and systems (including the ADL fuel processor), as well as work on advanced turbomachinery for air management of pressurized fuel cell systems. In view of the critical importance but largely undeveloped state of fuel cell power plant systems integration, DOE in recent years began to support multi-phase PEM fuel cell system development and integration efforts. Appendix C presents summaries of current DOE-funded programs in automotive fuel cell technology; Appendix D lists the supporting R&D projects carried out at seven DOE National Laboratories. In 1997, DOE substantially expanded the systems component of its transportation fuel cell program by awarding ""PRDA"" contracts for development and delivery of integrated fuel cell power plants to several teams of organizations that, between their members, should have the capabilities required to successfully address the key technology and systems issues identified earlier in this report (see, for example, sections II.2.E and III.1.D). A summary of these new efforts is given in Appendix E. Overall, DOE's annual budget for automotive fuel cell R&D now is approximately $30 million not counting the extensive private sector cofunding. A special role in the U.S. efforts to develop fuel cell engines for automobiles is played by the previously mentioned ""Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles"" (PNGV). PNGV, formed in 1993 under a Presidential Initiative as a partnership between the domestic automobile industry and the Federal Government, is to advance U.S. automotive technology in general, improve automobile manufacturing competitiveness, and foster the development of a family car with a 80 mpg fuel efficiency. PNGV is serving as a focus and coordination agency for many federally and privately funded automotive technology development and engineering programs1. Federal funding (budgeted primarily through DOE) is concentrated on advanced technologies in pursuit of the 80 mpg fuel efficiency goal. The technical strategies being followed include vehicle weight reduction, improvement of aerodynamics, and development of advanced, high-efficiency power sources. Early in PNGV's program, PEM fuel cells were being recognized as having the best long-term potential for high efficiency and low emissions, and they were selected as one of PNGV's automotive power plant options. This selection substantially increased the interest in automotive fuel cells, and it increased support for budgeting and implementing collaborative programs to develop PEM fuel cell power plant technology. While fuel cells were not selected for near-term development of prototype  1  Besides DOE, the Departments of Commerce, Defense and Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the National Science Foundation participate in PNGV.   automotive engines under its program, PNGV recognizes the fundamental potential and the remarkable development progress of PEM automotive fuel cells. In its 4th report, the standing committee charged with review of the research program of PNGV recommend that ""U.S. government and industry investments in research and development [of fuel cells] should, therefore, be continued at current levels or even be increased for an extended period."" Equally important, virtually all PNGV-affiliated organizations active in developing the various aspects of automotive fuel cell technology have continued (in may cases, expanded) their own programs. Europe The European Commission (EC) began to support fuel cell research and technology development (RTD) for transportation applications in 1993 through the JOULE Progamme which is overseen by the EC Directorates for Science, Research and Technology and for Energy. From an early focus on compact reformers and reformer-fuel cell stack-vehicle integration, the EC transportation fuel cell program has grown to include development of advanced stack technology. Current plans include development of a metallic membrane for separating hydrogen from processed fuel, advanced stack development for PEM and for direct methanol fuel cells, and a feasibility study of hydrogen vehicles and their supporting infrastructure. At about 23 million ECU of cumulative funding through mid-1997, the EC program in PEM automotive fuel cells is still modest. However, the program has strong private-sector participation and cofunding, a clear rationale, and reasonable prospects for being expanded further. Appendix F summarizes the strategy, funding and projects of EC's automotive fuel cell program. Japan MITI has been funding a broad-based fuel cell R&D program since many years. The overall organization of this program -- which is planned and coordinated by MITI's New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) -- is shown in Appendix G which also includes the program's PEM fuel cell R&D activities and the targeted power plant characteristics. Automotive applications and technology are not the main subject of the MITI/NEDO fuel cell program: the PEM technology R&D budget is less than 10% of total fuel cell funding (about 6 billion , or approximately $46 million, per year), and only a part of the PEM fuel cell activities address automotive power source applications. The Panel obtained technical information on two key MITI/NEDO projects during its visits with Mitsubishi Electric (compact reformer) and Asahi Chemical (advanced PE membrane).   B.  FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS In the Panel's view, resolution of the performance, operability and cost issues surrounding PEM  automotive fuel cell development will depend to a large extent on the capabilities and resources that the major fuel cell power plant technology developers and automobile manufacturers will bring to bear during the next 3-5 years. Accordingly, the Panel augmented its technical questions of these organizations with inquiries about corporate strategies, plans and resource commitments for automotive fuel cell development and prospective manufacturing. Broadly speaking, the Panel encountered two different responses: articulation of strong corporate commitments and plans to achieve technical and market leadership in PEM automotive fuel cells on the one hand, and more cautious expressions of interest on the other. This interest is driven by a number of factors that include corporate involvement in government-funded development programs, awareness of the commitments made by competitors, and fuel cell technology and business advocacy positions by a minority of staff and/or management. Significantly, several organizations in the latter group were moving toward more active, committed strategies during the Panel's study. Ballard Power Systems (BPS) BPS stands out in the first group of organizations. The senior technical and business management of BPS provided the most definitive information on their business plans, the scope of these plans is the most comprehensive, and the capabilities and resources being committed by BPS and its allies are the most extensive among PEM fuel cell developers. Specifically, the BPS-Daimler Benz-Ford alliance is committing more than Can.$1 billion (about U.S. $750 million) to developing all aspects of PEM fuel cell technology to the point where mass-manufacturability is established and the key manufacturing processes are defined. Ballard management believes that the alliance now has the financial resources, facilities and key technical staff needed to reach this point over the next 2 years. Ballard anticipated these needs and has been working since mid-1996 to meet them; they now have about 200 technical staff working on automotive stack technology out of a 450 staff total. Manufacturing expertise and facilities of Daimler Benz (and, presumably, from Ford) are being integrated into the overall effort. Within that effort, BPS is responsible for PEM automotive stack technology and manufacturing. Presently, make/buy decisions on various fuel cell components are being made, and the stack design will be frozen by the end of 1998. Rough estimates have been established for the layout and costs of a pilot manufacturing plant (capacity   several thousands of fuel cell stacks per year) and the first production plant (hundreds of thousands of stacks per year). Ballard's plan calls for establishment of pilot-scale stack production by 2000, using processes representative of a commercial operation. Between now and 2002, BPS will produce a limited number of stacks for U.S., European and Japanese customers, to stimulate evaluation of the technology and development of a market. BPS expects to produce the stacks necessary for 40,000 fuel cell engines in 2004, 70,000 in 2005 and 100,000 in 2006. BPS has major although still preliminary commitments from Daimler Benz and Ford who have stated their intent to produce commercial quantities of fuel cell electric vehicles beginning in 2004, in the assumption that go-ahead decisions are made in about 2 years from now. The Panel considers these projections credible in view of Ballard's rapid progress toward its technical objectives (see e.g., Figures III-1 and -2); Ballard's comprehensive, systematic development program and the availability of the resources needed to sustain and expand it; the extensive, state-of-theart development and testing facilities; Ballard's strong focus on cost, manufacturability and manufacturing; the clear business strategy of BPS management; and the extent and quality of the collaborations BPS has established with Daimler Benz and Ford. International Fuel Cells (IFC) IFC is among the world's leaders in fuel cells on the basis of the organization's many years of experience and its extensive fuel cell development and fabrication capabilities and facilities. Previous report sections (III.1.A-D) presented information on IFC's growing involvement in PEM automotive fuel cell technology development. Until recently, however, this involvement appeared limited to the roles of a DOE contractor for PEM stack development and a member of DOE-funded teams to develop integrated PEM automotive power plants. In January 1998, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), the parent of IFC, announced the commitment of substantial corporate resources to accelerate the development of gasoline-fueled PEM fuel cell power plants/engines for automobiles. While details of the UTC commitment were not available, the reorganization of IFC for this new business orientation, and the associated increase of technical staff (reportedly, from 90 to 150) assigned to it, are considered significant by the Panel. IFC management is now discussing partnerships in the fuel cell engine business with automobile manufacturers throughout the world. The next 6-12 months should clarify how the UTC/IFC initiative is structured and whether it is likely result in a viable new competitor in the emerging fuel cell industry.   Other PEM Fuel Cell Developers As summarized in Table III-1, other competent organizations are engaged in PEM fuel cell stack and system development; their technical achievements were discussed in Section III.1.A. Several of these organizations -- in particular AlliedSignal and Siemens -- have the corporate resources and capabilities required for commercialization of automotive fuel cell technology. Both companies also have major energy conversion technology and system capabilities that reinforce their capabilities for development of fuel cell electric engines. So far, however, they have not made corporate commitments to automotive fuel cells as a potentially major new business area. Other companies such as Plug Power and DeNora are active as partners in government-funded automotive fuel cell stack and system development programs. Plug Power and DeNora do not have the large resources required for establishment of production facilities on the level of an automotive mass market and are, therefore, aiming for other PEM fuel cell markets with less demanding technical and cost targets.  C.  AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS Many examples exist of promising advanced technologies that did not make it in the marketplace  because the organizations capable of transforming the technologies into technically viable and marketable products were not involved in their development. No competitive fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is likely to materialize without the direct involvement and leadership of major automobile producers, nor is the public likely to turn to a new automotive product that does not have their backing. Just as important, and as discussed throughout this report, the prospects for cost-competitiveness of fuel cell electric engines -- and thus of FCEVs -- are tied closely to mass manufacturing on a scale that is familiar to, and feasible for, major automobile manufacturers only. In this context, the major commitment of Daimler-Benz to fuel cell electric engine and vehicle development through the joint venture with Ballard Power Systems was a milestone that signaled automobile manufacturer involvement on the necessary scale. Especially during the last 12 months, it has become clear that many of the world's largest automobile manufacturers also are, or are becoming, engaged in major programs to develop and, if possible, commercialize fuel cell electric engines and vehicles in the next decade. The Panel made a significant effort to understand not only the technical progress but the corporate strategies and commitments of these programs, as summarized in the next several sections.   Domestic Automobile Manufacturers All three major U.S. car makers are engaged in fuel cell electric engine (and vehicle) development although to different degrees and with different strategies. At first, their involvement probably was fostered by the companies' key role in PNGV which had identified fuel cells as one of the promising high-efficiency engine options for the future. Also, fuel cells held out promise to become a fundamentally new and superior response to the continuing pressures from Federal and State agencies (including prominently the California Air Resources Board) for ever-lower vehicle emissions. More recently, the awareness of vigorous fuel cell engine development programs by foreign manufacturers (especially those of Daimler-Benz and Toyota) may well have accelerated decisions to increase program scope, commit more resources, and enter into strategic alliances to develop all aspects of the technology. This awareness probably was heightened by the memory of the near-disastrous competition with foreign car manufacturers in which the industry found itself in the 1970s and 1980s. Fortuitously, U.S. automobile manufacturers at present are in the financial position to invest the resources required to resolve the many difficult issues reviewed in this report and, if justified by the progress and prospects, make the investments in production facilities. The current corporate activities, plans and commitments of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors are discussed below. 1. Chrysler Chrysler has a relatively modest program in fuel cell electric engine and vehicle development, and much of the effort is being carried out in the context of the DOE-funded PNGV program. Chrysler's corporate funding is focusing on the integration of PEM fuel cell subsystems procured from outside the corporation into fuel cell power plants and fuel cell electric vehicles. The key effort here is Chrysler's proof-of-concept battery-fuel cell hybrid vehicle which is being designed to operate on gasoline and targeted for completion in early 1999. The necessary fuel processor will be supplied by Delphi; Chrysler is the systems integrator and will supply the hybrid drive train and the control system. The hybrid battery will be large enough to handle power demand during start-up and for acceleration/hill climbing. Chrysler staff mentioned a number of technical issues and concerns requiring resolution, including sulfur level in gasoline (need for removal in the refinery or, alternatively, demonstration that the fuel cell can operate properly on sulfur-containing gasoline for at least 100,000 miles); difficulty of removing CO down to the <10 ppm level; unavailability of compact air handling turbomachinery with the needed high efficiency, adequate transient response, and low cost; lack of suitable batteries for   hybrid vehicle applications; and the cost increment likely to be added by the fuel cell power plant and the other components such as the battery since the complete hybrid power system must be costcompetitive with IC engines.) The FCEV development and commercialization schedule below was mentioned as a possibility, but to date no specific strategy and/or resource commitments to such a schedule appear to have been made by Chrysler. PNGV concept vehicle Prototype meeting PNGV goals Order of fuel cell components in quantity Limited production Full production 2002 2006 2006/2008 2008/2010 2016  Factors and issues mentioned by Chrysler staff as bearing importantly on the prospects of automotive fuel cells include the following: (1) No major changes in petroleum availability and price are expected before 2010 which is likely to limit the economic advantages of high-efficiency fuel cell power plants. (2) The power generation market may emerge as an earlier, technoeconomically easier application of PEM fuel cells, but investments in PEM fuel cell technology are driven mainly by the automobile application, at least at present. (3) A ""successful"" battery (for all-battery EVs) might negatively impact the prospects for fuel cell electric engines. (4) Fuel cell electric vehicles will need to offer advantages -- such as lower fuel consumption -- at competitive prices if consumers are to buy them. At present, Chrysler does not seem committed to be a major player in automotive fuel cell engine/vehicle development and commercialization. Consistent with this perception of the Panel, Chrysler staff stated that the company would initially buy all key fuel cell components/subsystems. If and when a mass market of 100,000 vehicles per year develops (e.g., after 2010), Chrysler will acquire fuel cell engine technology appropriate for its automobile products. (The recent merger with DaimlerBenz could provide Chrysler with a logical source of fuel cell technology and, also, increase DB's focus on gasoline.)   2.  Ford Ford has a long history of developing electric, hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles and evaluating  advanced power source technologies for vehicle propulsion. The discovery and development of sodium ion-conducting solid-electrolyte batteries, the ETX series of experimental vehicles and, currently, the Electric Ranger pickup truck are examples of advanced developments that have given Ford experience in electric vehicle power sources and drive trains much of which is relevant to fuel cell electric vehicle propulsion. As explained to the Panel, Ford's experience in marketing battery-electric and alternative fuel vehicles has been less than positive up to now, for two reasons that can be expected to become important issues also for fuel cell electric vehicles, (1) the high price, especially of battery-electric vehicles such as the Electric Ranger but also of CNG vehicles, and (2) infrastructure-related issues for EVs and CNG vehicles but also for methanol vehicles with IC engines. The high cost of installing refueling/recharging facilities, especially those permitting rapid fueling (CNG) or battery charging, is a major disincentive for service stations, and slow-filling/charging home installations are a significant financial burden for individual owners. Specific concerns articulated by Ford staff during the Panel's visit (which occurred before Ford joined the Daimler Benz-Ballard alliance) were whether consumers will buy FCEVs (""why buy"") if these do not offer substantial advantage(s) over ICE vehicles. Continued low gasoline prices might restrict the appeal of high-efficiency FCEVs to operators of high-mileage vehicle fleets. When discussing the emission benefits of FCEVs, the staff noted that Ford already has vehicles that meet SULEV standards with CNG-fueled IC engines, LEV (possibly even ULEV) standards with dual-fuel or gasoline IC engines. Despite these concerns, Ford has been engaged in fuel cell subsystem and vehicle development for several years, primarily through its participation in DOE-funded, PNGVcoordinated efforts to evaluate PEM fuel cell stack technology and, currently, assemble breadboard-level fuel cell power plants. Beyond these efforts, Ford has proposed to use its P-2000 lightweight (Taurus size) experimental ICE vehicle as a test bed to evaluate experimental fuel cell systems. Ford will likely adopt a pure fuel cell vehicle power system . However, hybrid configurations -- ranging from addition of a small battery for regenerative braking and supplementary power, to a small fuel cell used as ""range extender"" for a battery EV -- have not yet been ruled out. Also uncertain at present is the ultimate cost of FCEVs in mass production since the required in-depth cost studies have not yet been done for fuel cell-based   propulsion systems. Initially, FCEV costs will undoubtedly be high but mass production might eventually result in costs comparable to ICE vehicles. No information was provided about the extent of Ford's internal fuel cell effort but it is generally known that it has been limited to the evaluation of candidate technologies (such as stacks, hybrid batteries, etc.) through testing of technology acquired from outside the company, and extensive studies of system alternatives (including fuel infrastructure). Despite the uncertainties and concerns about the technology and cost issues, potential benefits and customer acceptance of FCEVs, Ford appears determined to be a major player if and when PEM fuel cell engines begin to emerge as a viable alternative to IC engines. This determination is attested to by Ford's investment2 of Can. $ 412.5 million in the Daimler Benz-Ballard joint venture and its additional investment of about U.S.$ 150 million in ECo, a new joint venture (with Daimler-Benz and Ballard Power Systems) for development and manufacturing of electric drive trains. Regarding possible schedules for development and commercialization of FCEVs, Ford staff noted that the time between establishment of key components and the first commercial production of a car is 2-3 years for established (ICE) technology, perhaps 5-6 years for new technologies such as fuel cells. Since major components/subsystems of FCEVs (for example, on-board hydrogen storage for hydrogen-air fuel cells; fuel processors for methanol- or gasoline-powered fuel cells) are not yet established, commercial FCEVs are probably about 10 years away. It remained unclear whether this tentative schedule already is part of Ford's strategy and plan for introduction of fuel cell electric vehicles. Assuming that the commercialization timeline discussed above (Section III.3.B) for Ballard Power Systems is maintained, the co-ownership in DBB Fuel Cell Engines would seem to provide Ford with fuel cell-based automobile power plants in time for commercialization of a fuel cell electric vehicle in -- or possibly before -- 10 years.  2  With this investment, Ford acquired a 15% ownership of Ballard Power System (BPS) and a 23.3% share of Daimler-Benz Ballard Fuel Cell Engines (DBB).   3.  General Motors GM probably has more experience with electric vehicles than any other major automobile  manufacturer and is the first one to introduce a battery-powered personal car (the EV1) to the consumer market. A second EV product (a lead acid battery-powered S10 pickup truck) is just being launched. As pointed out to the Panel during its visit with GM, to date only about 20% of the limited market projected for the EV1 has materialized, ostensibly because of the vehicle's high price, its restricted driving range, and the recharging infrastructure which is still quite limited even in the areas selected for market launch. The imminent switch from lead acid to nickel metal hydride batteries will increase the range and utility of the EV1 but also its cost; it may therefore not expand the market. GM is aggressively pursuing expansion of recharging infrastructure and increased incentives for electric vehicles through efforts with States, utilities and electric vehicle coalitions. Also, GM is proceeding with efforts to reduce the cost of next generation EV components and is committed to increase production volumes of EVs in step with anticipated cost reductions. These efforts are intended to help resolve the Catch 22 problem in which high price limits a product's market, the limited production volume precludes the major cost and price reductions possible only with mass manufacturing, and the high price/limited market situation persists as a result. Several aspects of GM's battery EV initiative are relevant for fuel cell electric vehicles, including successful development of advanced electric drivetrain technology, establishment of local/regional marketing initiatives and infrastructures, and initial experience with customer acceptance. Significantly, from proving the concept 7 years were required to move EV1 through the stages of technical feasibility and preliminary assessment of the market to launch the product in 1997. From the EV1 experience and its growing involvement in automotive fuel cell component and system development, GM has concluded that: (1) Achievement of competitive cost for a fuel cell engine ($ 3000 was mentioned as a target) will be even more difficult than for batteries because fuel cell engines are more complex systems than batteries. (2) Start-up, system control, driveability and potential for some emissions are issues for fuel cell development beyond those encountered with batteries; cold start is a particularly difficult problem since it must be accomplished in seconds, not minutes. (3) Large resources (hundreds of millions of dollars) will be required to resolve these issues and develop fuel cells into an engine technology that can be mass manufactured at the low costs   needed. Fuel processor and balance of plant may well pose more difficult cost challenges than the stack. Presently, PEM automotive fuel cell technology is in the proof-of-concept stage. In GM's view, this applies to all current programs, including GM's own fuel processor and fuel cell system laboratory ""breadboard"" systems. Several redesigns will be required before technical feasibility can be proven by demonstrating acceptable performance and safety. In subsequent phases, a number of redesigns of components, systems and, eventually, the complete fuel cell electric engine-vehicle system will be required to integrate technology advances, cost-reducing design changes, infrastructure learning, and responses to customer/market signals. Market launch can be undertaken only after reliability and durability is established, prospective costs are near targets, and an adequate infrastructure is in place. Finally, several more redesigns and establishment of volume production will be necessary before FCEVs can be commercially viable. GM did not provide a time table for this sequence because of the uncertainties associated especially with the early phases. An analogy with the EV1 schedule would suggest about 7 years to market launch, broadly consistent with the statement of GM's Board Vice Chairman (at the Automotive News World Congress, January 1998 in Detroit) that GM would have a ""production-ready fuel cell vehicle by 2004."" The current and planned commitments of GM to fuel cell electric engine and vehicle development were not revealed to the Panel. However, by GM's own estimation several hundred million dollars will be required over the relatively near term to establish a technology leadership position, and the growth and corporate consolidation of GM's fuel cell activities in a dedicated organization make clear that GM intends to be among the leaders. The corporation appears fully committed to the development and commercialization of fuel cell electric vehicles ""if it can be done."" Automobile Manufacturers in Europe and Japan During its study, the Panel became aware that as many as ten3 or more automobile manufacturers in Europe and Japan were engaged in the evaluation and development of fuel cells for automobile propulsion. In the collection and review of information, however, the Panel covered only about half of these, in the belief that it was sufficient for the purposes of this report to assess what we  3  Including at least Daimler-Benz, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen and Volvo in Europe; Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota in Japan.   believed to be the most advanced efforts. This section covers only three of these manufacturers: Daimler-Benz and Toyota who are generally believed to be leaders in the field and have announced their intent to offer FCEVs commercially within 6 years, and Honda who demonstrated its commitment to electric vehicles by launching the EV Plus and who has accelerated its fuel cell development program substantially over the last few years. 1. Daimler-Benz The long history of automotive technology leadership of Daimler Benz carried over into a broad investigation of alternate vehicle power sources and fuels during 1970s and 1980s. The involvement with battery and hybrid electric vehicles4 (cars as well as buses) has given DB extensive experience with electric drivetrains and their integration into vehicles which is directly applicable in the development of fuel cell electric vehicles. As explained to the Panel during its visit in September 1997, DB's exploration of fuel cells as possible automotive power sources began in 1990, initially with focus on hydrogen as fuel. In 1994, DB researchers completed their first experimental FCEV, the NeCar 1 van, which served as a test bed for the components and the system characteristics of a 50 kW hydrogen-air fuel cell. The NeCar 1 fuel cell stacks were supplied by Ballard; ten stacks of the type shown on the left in Figure III-1 were required to generate 50 kW. The fuel cell power plant used most of the van's passenger space and all of its cargo volume. Since then, DB working with Ballard evolved the hydrogen-air fuel PEM power plant technology to the point where the fuel cell engines used in the NeCar 2 van and NeBus vehicles no longer intrude in either cargo or passenger space. Both vehicles store hydrogen under high pressure in cylinders mounted on their roofs, and hydrogen storage now dominates the volume required by the fuel cell power plant. Daimler Benz is continuing development of hydrogen-air fuel cell power plant technology for possible commercial application in buses. They believe that, for buses, storage of compressed hydrogen on the roof of vehicles is likely to become acceptable with further advances of safety aspects and reduction of costs. If and when hydrogen production and fueling facilities of acceptable costs become 4  Daimler-Benz has been active in battery and hybrid electric vehicles for about twenty years. Since 1987, the DB subsidiary AEG has been developing the sodium-nickel chloride (""ZEBRA"") battery in a major joint venture with Anglo-American Ltd. One Panel member (FRK) was given the opportunity to test a ZEBRA battery-powered experimental EV based on the new Mercedes Benz A-Class. Installed in a number of these vehicles, ZEBRA battery prototypes are demonstrating specific energy around 100 Wh/kg, long cycle life, and good power. A decision on the establishment of a facility for production of about 30,000 battery packs per year is pending. If a go-ahead decision is made soon, ZEBRA batteries could become commercially available in 2001 at about $300/kW, with potential for further cost reductions if/as production volume increases. ZEBRA battery-powered A-Class cars are a candidate for meeting DB's ZEV obligations in 2003.   available, hydrogen-air fuel cell buses could become part of strategies to reduce urban emissions of air pollutants (with possible emission credits against ICE vehicle emissions) as well as emissions of carbon dioxide5. In DB's view, unpressurized liquid fuels are needed for smaller vehicles providing individual transport. In 1996, when DB began to consider fuel cells as a future engine for mass-produced automobiles, methanol was selected as fuel because of the greater ease and higher efficiency of processing methanol into a hydrogen-rich gas. Methanol also is considered more compatible with longer-term resource and greenhouse gas strategies. Finally, methanol offers some albeit currently rather uncertain prospects for its direct use in automotive PEM fuel cells which would greatly simplify the fuel cell engine. On the other hand, at present there is little or no ""infrastructure"" for supplying large quantities of pure methanol. DB has, therefore, initiated discussions with the methanol and oil industries to stimulate discussion and possible development of suitable methanol production and distribution infrastructures. A special organization (""Fuel Cell House"" = FCH) was formed in 1996 to lead the DB fuel cell vehicle program. Headed by a Senior Vice President who reports directly to the DB Executive Vice President for Passenger Car Development, FCH has about 30 staff members of its own, and it can call on the entire capabilities of DB including the corporate research groups and vehicle testing facilities as well as the engineering expertise and facilities of Mercedes Benz. The Daimler-Benz FCH also is empowered to enter into special arrangements. At the time of the Panel's visit, the most important of these had just become official: formation of Daimler Benz-Ballard Fuel Cell Engines (termed DBB in the following), as part of a set of transactions that included acquisition by DB of a 25% share in Ballard Power Systems (BPS). DBB, owned 2/3 by DB and 1/3 by BPS, was invested with Can.$110 million in cash from the parents as well as with all of the automotive fuel cell stack and system technologies of BPS and Daimler-Benz6. Other DB-external alliances of the Fuel Cell House cover fuel processor catalyst development and electric drive train optimization/cost reduction. DBB's business objective is to develop and commercialize automotive fuel cell engines that will be sold by Ballard Automotive (another new company, owned in equal amounts by Ballard and DBB) to 5  6  The voluntary 25% reduction of CO2 emissions from cars offered by German automobile producers between now and 2005 creates a substantial incentive for introduction of high-efficiency fuel cell engines. As noted above (see Ford), the ownerships of BPS and DBB were broadened and their resources increased when Ford joined the alliance of Daimler-Benz and Ballard.   the world's automotive industry, with first call by DB. The stacks for DBB-produced fuel cell engines will be supplied by BPS, at least for the foreseeable future. Automotive fuel cell stack development is led by BPS, development of fuel processors and complete fuel cell systems/engines by DBB. Both companies are working in parallel on product and manufacturing technology development. Management and key technical activities of the Daimler-Benz Fuel Cell House and DBB are being consolidated in one facility in Nabern near Stuttgart, Germany. About 75 technical staff are engaged primarily in methanol fuel processor development and in the integration of the required subsystems into complete fuel cell power plants. Component and subsystem development is focusing on configurations amenable to mass manufacturing and on advanced manufacturing techniques, taking advantage of the modern automotive engineering and manufacturing development expertise and techniques (such as computer-aided design and rapid prototyping) available at the various Mercedes Benz R,D&E facilities in the Stuttgart area. Daimler-Benz engineering staff believe that fuel cell technology is fundamentally better suited for very rapid, low-cost manufacturing than conventional engine production. As discussed earlier (see Section III.1.D), a major recent milestone was the completion of NeCar 3, the world's first but still experimental methanol fuel cell-powered car using the Mercedes A-Class platform. Over the next 2 years, every part of the fuel cell engine will be developed to the point where processes for mass production are established and engine performance and cost can be estimated with confidence. Subsequent generations of NeCar vehicles will represent increasingly packaged versions of the engine technology. NeCar 5, scheduled for late 1999, will approach a production prototype configuration, with room for 4 persons and luggage in the rather small A-Class vehicle. As presently envisioned, this vehicle will have customer-acceptable operating characteristics with methanol-based fuel cell power alone although DB would have the experience and technology base to go to a batteryfuel cell hybrid configuration if considered necessary. At the end of 1999, a decision will be made whether to invest in manufacturing facilities for fuel cell engines. A go-ahead decision presupposes management confidence that fuel cell engines and vehicles will be able to compete with conventional engines and vehicles on all points while being cleaner and more efficient. Daimler-Benz top management recognizes that a positive decision is not assured but is confident that DBB with its allies have the ability to engineer all aspects of fuel cell engine technology to the point of commercial viability when mass-produced -- at least 100,000 engines   and vehicles per year once full production is first established, and growing to perhaps 500,000 or more units per year eventually. Several years and investments of more than $ 1 billion will be needed from this decision point until the various manufacturing facilities are in place and operating reliably. Additional time will be required until FCEVs can be offered to the general public; even with a completely successful program, this cannot occur before 2004/5. The Daimler-Benz Management Board is prepared to support the necessary investments in the belief that the fuel cell is the potentially best alternative to the internal combustion engine given the requirements for ever cleaner engines and the emerging pressures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 2. Toyota Toyota has investigated alternate automotive power sources for several decades, seeking a leadership role in reducing the environmental impacts of the automobile. More than 25 years ago, Toyota started a battery EV program which ultimately resulted in the RAV4 EV that is now commercially available in parts of the U.S. In 1995, Toyota jointly with Matsushita committed to the construction of the world's first plant for production of nickel-metal hydride batteries developed and engineered for electric vehicles. This plant is now supplying the batteries for the RAV4 EV and the Honda EV Plus, giving these battery EVs ranges of more than 100 miles under realistic driving conditions. Toyota's ""Prius"" car is the first ICE engine-battery hybrid vehicle available commercially (at present only in Japan) from a major automobile manufacturer. Because of the publicity Toyota has been receiving for its work on fuel cell electric vehicles, the Panel made its October 1997 visit and discussion with the Toyota fuel cell team a high priority. As explained to the Panel, Toyota's efforts to develop automotive fuel cells first focused on hydrogen as fuel and on the consequent need for a compact and inexpensive technology for on-board storage of hydrogen. An advanced alloy was developed which permits storage of hydrogen as a metal hydride in 1/8 of the volume that would have been required by the same amount of gaseous hydrogen compressed to 3000 psi. Work on lower-cost hydrogen storage alloys is continuing but Toyota is now concentrating on methanol as a fuel more likely to become broadly available for fuel cell electric vehicles at an acceptable cost in the foreseeable future. Toyota's program addresses every aspect of fuel cell power plant and FCEV technology, from basic research to increase performance and reduce cost of MEAs, to the integration of key subsystems into fuel cell engines and into the RAV 4 EV platform that serves as Toyota's experimental fuel cell vehicle.   The features of Toyota's fuel processor and fuel cell stack (both developed and built in limited quantities in-house) were described in Sections III.1.A and B. Toyota technical staff stressed in the discussion and their questionnaire responses that breakthroughs (perhaps best interpreted as major technical advances) are still needed to achieve the stringent cost goals especially for the key components of the stack. The staff also noted that the need to be competitive with ICE engines and vehicles will define fuel cell power plant performance, operating characteristics and reliability requirements but detailed specifications for the various fuel cell subsystems had not yet been derived from these requirements. Because key features of a number of components and subsystems are not yet defined, their manufacturing development cannot be initiated at this time. An important aspect of Toyota's approach is that their fuel cell will be part of a hybrid vehicle power system which will use a nickel-metal hydride battery and an electric drive train much like the RAV4 EV. The hybrid battery will reduce the demand for rapid response (including cold start) and peak power of the fuel cell engine. Consistent with this, the fuel cell engine will be rated at 25kW (see Table III-15) compared to the more typical 50-60kW of other developers. The battery will be capable of about 25kW as well, for a total peak power output of 50kW. The drawbacks of hybrid drive systems -- greater system complexity and the cost of the battery -- apparently are judged acceptable by Toyota, perhaps on the basis of the experience with, and expectations for the Prius hybrid vehicle. The subsystem layout of Toyota's methanol-fueled ""FCEV"" was shown in Section III.1.D (Figure III-5); a mockup of this configuration was exhibited at the 1997 Frankfurt International Automobile Exhibition. According to Toyota, a functionally integrated but still experimental vehicle is now being operated to demonstrate technical feasibility and to serve as a test bed for improving engine and vehicle operating characteristics. Toyota's plans are to follow this with a ""feasibility prototype"" soon after the year 2000 and, assuming sufficient progress, with a production prototype. The Toyota fuel cell team was reluctant to give a timetable for these milestones because of the major uncertainties surrounding the achievement of cost reduction goals. They pointed our that the step from feasibility to production prototypes can take between 10 and 15 years7, as was the case for their battery electric and hybrid vehicles.  7  The Panel notes, however, that Toyota already has both, the fully developed electric drive train of the RAV4 EV and the hybrid technology of the PRIUS which is produced in near-commercial quantities. The availability of these technologies could considerably shorten the time to commercialize Toyota's FCEV once the fuel cell engine itself is developed to the point of economic manufacturability.   The Panel was unable to obtain estimates of the resources committed to Toyota's fuel cell and FCEV development program and was not given the opportunity to see any of the facilities dedicated to the program. The best indication that these resources and facilities are likely to be extensive comes from staff comments to the Panel that ""Toyota wants to be first with fuel cell-powered electric cars"" and from a recent statement by Toyota's President Hiroshi Okuda that, notwithstanding Daimler Benz' stated intent to put fuel cell vehicles into the market by 2004/5, ""our engineers have a strong feeling that we will be first to market."" 3. Honda Honda stresses its continued commitments to increasing the efficiency and reducing the environmental impacts of their cars. Sustained pursuit of these corporate objectives through Honda's engineering leadership has resulted in a number of important firsts that range from compliance with early emissions legislation in the U.S. with the CVCC engine, to the recent commercialization of the first cars meeting California's ULEV standards and the launching in 1998 of a 200-mile range CNGfueled fleet automobile emitting only 1/10 of ULEV standards. New technology is playing a key role in Honda's efficiency and ""environmental friendliness"" strategy, as evidenced by the EV Plus, the first purpose-built electric vehicle commercially available with a nickel-metal hydride battery. A novel light-weight ICE-ultracapacitor hybrid drive train is an important current development toward very high efficiencies. Both of these technologies contain elements that might become used in future fuel cell-powered electric vehicles. Honda's PEM fuel cell program, started in 1989, to date has not sought much publicity. However, Honda invited the Panel to visit the Wako R&D Center for a thorough briefing and a laboratory tour of Honda's PEM fuel cell development and testing facilities. In Honda's corporate view, fuel cell electric vehicles offer the best prospects for minimizing8 or, in the longer term, perhaps eliminating both, air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Other key arguments include higher fuel efficiency and the possibility to broaden Japan's fuel supply base by linking transportation to natural gas via methanol as the fuel for FCEVs. In Honda's view, the fuel cell will eventually replace the IC engine although no time frame was mentioned. Consistent with the potential importance of the fuel cell and Honda's strong engineering orientation, Honda staff believe that they must master all aspects of this new power source technology. Similar to Toyota's, Honda's fuel cell development program is therefore  8  Honda's current target for methanol fuel cell emissions is 10% of ULEV standards.   carried out in-house at this time; make-or-buy decisions will come once Honda's competitiveness can be assessed against the capabilities and costs of outside suppliers of fuel cell components and subsystems. Honda's current technical focus and some of their achievements to date were mentioned in Sections III.1.A and B, above. Honda staff emphasized that their work still is R&D to establish the core technologies for a future fuel cell engine. The currently committed staff resources and modern lab-level component fabrication and stack testing facilities are consistent with this but likely to increase in the near future. Assuming continued R&D success, Honda anticipates entering an approximately 5-year phase of subsystem integration and power plant field tests. The implication from this is that, given complete success, FCEV commercialization could begin around 2005/06 , but in Honda's view the timing of market penetration is likely to be different in the U.S., Japan, the European Community and Asia, reflecting significant socio-economic differences. The initially higher cost of FCEVs will be a challenge; for example, each EV Plus is still being sold at a loss. The platform for Honda's fuel cell electric vehicle has not yet been defined, and it is not yet clear how the costs of FCEVs will compare to those of battery EVs. In any event, the important cost comparison is the one with ICE-powered cars. Despite the anticipated challenges, Honda is committed to make the necessary investments in technology development, engineering, manufacturing development and production facilities because of the ultimate potential of FCEVs. Honda's expectation is that FCEVs and, also, CNG-fueled ICE vehicles eventually will capture market share even from high-efficiency ULEVs. Summary of Major Programs and Prospects for FCEVs In summary, major efforts are underway in the North America, Europe and Japan to develop PEM fuel cell technology and systems for automobile propulsion. They are being undertaken by the organizations whose participation and leadership is essential if a commercially viable automotive fuel cell electric engine and vehicle is to emerge: leading automobile manufactures with track records in advanced automotive technology, including the development of electric and hybrid vehicles. Equally important, the world's leaders in PEM fuel cell technology are, or will be, participating in key alliances with these manufacturers. The integrated efforts are supported by well-focused government R&D programs of significant size (especially in the United States), and they draw on the advanced technology leadership of a growing number of organizations who look to PEM automotive fuel cells as a potentially large business opportunity for their specialized products and skills.   In the Panel's estimate, the R&D investments made to date and the commitments for next few years by major fuel cell developers and automobile manufacturers already are between $1.5 and 2 billion, and additional resources -- both, financial resources and technical capabilities -- are likely to be committed as programs move increasingly from R&D into the larger and more expensive phases of engine systems integration and evaluation/testing, engineering of component, subsystem and system technologies for low cost mass production, and development of the required manufacturing processes. The efforts to date already have resulted in major technical advances, especially in PEM fuel cell stack technology but also in other critical subsystem areas, as discussed in earlier sections of this report and summarized in Figure III-7. From its discussions with fuel cell developers and automobile manufacturers engaged in automotive fuel cell engine development, the Panel tried to indicate the current status of the leading efforts in the industrial development timeline of Figure III-8, recognizing that this simplified representation of multifaceted programs reflects both subjective judgment and substantial uncertainty due to rather incomplete information on some of the programs. Probably more important than any comparisons of program status, Figure III-8 shows graphically the point made repeatedly in this report: that major steps are still ahead even for the most advanced programs before confident predictions are possible on the commercial prospects of fuel cell electric engines and vehicles, and still more time will be required until FCEVs can be launched. At this time, the most compelling arguments for the Panel's cautious optimism about these prospects are that remarkable technical advances have been achieved in a relatively short time, and that the promise of the fuel cell as a new, fundamentally cleaner and more efficient automobile engine is being pursued with an unprecedented combination of resources by powerful organizations acting in their own interest and with strong public support. The Panel, therefore, considers the statements of several major automobile manufacturers -- that they expect to have production-ready fuel cell electric vehicles by the year 2004 -- as bona fide expressions of the automakers' plans and confidence. Given the current status, the steps still ahead, and the limited time available for their completion as shown in Figures III-7 and III-8, success at every turn and manufacturing investment decisions at the earliest possible times will be required to commercialize fuel cell electric engines and vehicles in a short 6 years from now.   0  2  4  6  8  10 (years)  DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE AND PHASES Breadboard Brassboard Performance Acceptance Prototype Cost Acceptance Prototype Production Preparation Production Ready PEM FUEL CELL ENGINE DEVELOPMENT STATUS GM IFC (Bus) Toyota DBB/Ford Ballard (H2 Bus) FUEL CELL VEHICLE DEVELOPMENT STATUS Chrysler Ford GM Toyota DB  Figure III-8.

With the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius already on the streets and interest in energy efficiency on the rise, several automakers used the auto show as a forum to showcase their upcoming plans to bring advanced technology vehicles to market.     Ford Motor Company announced its plans for a hybrid Explorer, which will debut sometime after the Escape hybrid is introduced in 2003. Ford showcased the hybrid Escape at the Los Angeles International Auto Show a week before the show in Detroit. The Escape, expected to get 40 miles per gallon, will use an electric motor for propulsion and a four-cylinder gasoline engine. The Explorer will use a six-cylinder engine with electric assist. Both models will feature integrated starter-generator technology that automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle stops, such as at a traffic light. The Explorer hybrid will also employ a regenerative braking system for its 42-volt battery used to provide an acceleration boost at start up. A smaller 12-volt battery will supplement power to run devices such as lamps and radios. For more information, check out Ford's hybrid Web site:  www.hybridford.com .    Among the newest concepts DaimlerChrysler unveiled at the Detroit auto show was the Dodge PowerBox, a hybrid-electric SUV. Unlike other hybrid SUVs, the PowerBox combines a supercharged V-6 engine that uses compressed natural gas (CNG) and an electric motor to supplement power and increase efficiency. A large SUV, the PowerBox concept has room for eight passengers, comparable in size to the gasoline-powered Dodge Durango, but with 60% better fuel economy. And because it's powered primarily by CNG, the PowerBox runs cleaner, with near zero emissions. For more information, visit  www.daimlerchrysler.com .     Building on last year's Precept hybrid concept vehicle, General Motors unveiled its new hybrid propulsion system, the ParadiGM, which the company will be able to apply to a variety of vehicles, from passenger sedans to SUVs and trucks to commercial vehicles. The ParadiGM system combines a conventional V-6 or an inline four-cylinder engine with two electric motors and a battery pack to provide increased efficiency. The first hybrid application will be a mid-size SUV with fuel economy 20% better than its conventionally powered counterparts. GM's hybrid SUV is expected to debut in 2004; the company announced that at least 7,000 vehicles will be produced in the first year. More hybrids may follow, depending on market demand.

Honda Civic GX receives California's AT-PZEV certification    The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in late December granted American Honda Motor Company partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV) certification for its natural-gas-powered Civic GX.     The rating came just weeks before the 2001 model car, described by the manufacturer as ""cleanest on earth,"" hit the U.S. market.    The standard, which falls under the super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) provision of CARB's recently released ZEV mandate, requires vehicles to support 15-year, 150,000 mile emission system durability. They must also have zero evaporative emissions. Under this stringent SULEV requirement, the Civic GX is now the first advanced-technology, partial-zero emission vehicle (AT-PZEV) says Stephen Ellis, American Honda's Manager of Alternative Fuel Vehicles.     An AT-PZEV gets distinct recognition and greater credits because it has a reduced ""full cycle"" emissions impact. ""Being the first to receive AT-PZEV status is nice for Honda and the near-zero emission Civic GX. It also proves the value of natural gas as a long-term alternative to gasoline,"" Ellis says.    Approved in January, CARB's new ZEV rule will require the sale of an estimated 4,650 full-size model year 2003 electric cars in California, and a comparable number of other super-clean and advanced technology vehicles as well. The ZEV minimums will rise to about 22,000 vehicles in 2010, and 50,000 in 2018. The SULEV provision allows car manufacturers to receive partial credits with PZEVs, including AT-PZEVs such as the Civic GX.      DaimlerChrysler Adds Neighborhood Electric Vehicles to Its Portfolio    DaimlerChrysler announced its acquisition of Global Electric MotorCars (GEM), becoming the first major automaker to sell neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) in the United States.    GEM, based in North Dakota, produces two- and four-passenger NEVs that can be licensed for use on public roads. The vehicles recharge in about eight hours using 110-volt household alterative current. NEVs have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are well suited for niche applications including local governments, parking enforcement, university and business campuses, and planned communities. The city of Denver, for example, through its ""Take Charge"" program, provides three NEVs for city employees to use for business downtown.     ""DaimlerChrysler is excited about the emerging market of neighborhood electric vehicles and the opportunities that GEM affords,"" said Mike Clement, Director of Alternative Fuel Sales and Marketing. ""This acquisition fits well with DaimlerChrysler's alternative fuel vehicle strategy.""             |  Table of Contents  |  Cover  |  Features:   |  Discouraging Idle Behavior  |  Trucks of the Future  |  Propane Vehicle Rally  |   |  Niche Markets  |  From the Automakers  |  Clean Cities Roundup   | |   Federal News  |  Upcoming Conferences and Events  |             [ DOE ] [ OWIP ] [ Webmaster ] [ AFDC Home ]"

Veneman announced key revisions to the Bioenergy Program to expand industrial consumption of agricultural commodities by promoting their use in the production of ethanol and biodiesel. Sign-up for the program will begin May 7 and end June 6. Any bioenergy producer who expects to have eligible production between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003, must enroll in the program during this signup period.       The program will promote sustained increases in bioenergy production and related industrial agricultural commodities, and will help improve the environment. Under the program, the Secretary of Agriculture makes payments through the Commodity Credit Corporation to eligible producers to encourage increased purchases of eligible commodities (energy feedstocks) for the purpose of expanding production of bioenergy and supporting new production capacity. Payments to eligible producers are based on the increase in quantity of bioenergy they produce during a fiscal year over the quantity they produced during the preceding fiscal year.

Six High Schools Win Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge Six high school teams were winners today of the first Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge, part of the DOE National Science Bowl. The teams of four students in each race received $1,000 for their science departments. Ten of the 66 National Science Bowl high school teams competed in the Model Car Challenge by designing, building, testing, and racing hydrogen fuel cell model cars. The cars were no larger than one foot wide and two feet long.  The cars used electricity from small solar panels to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen. The teams then stored the hydrogen on the car and used it to run a fuel cell that generated electricity to power a motor. Since no combustion was involved, the only by-products were heat and water. Engineers from DOE, and GM provided technical advice. GM provided the model car components.   Visit the  Office of Science Web site  for information on the teams and on the National Science Bowl.     Mayor Rocky Anderson Receives EPA Climate Protection Award Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City received the EPA Climate Protection Award, recognizing unprecedented efforts to slow global warming. Salt Lake City is the only municipality being recognized for its efforts, on a local level, to set an example for other cities. It is taking concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and health-endangering air pollutants. Mayor Anderson has spearheaded a broad range of cost-effective, innovative initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and has leveraged the international spotlight to draw attention to this issue.    The EPA nominated Anderson because of his commitment, announced early in 2002, to reduce greenhouse gases to 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. Salt Lake City now has a comprehensive Local Climate Action Plan, which involves actions in transportation, energy, waste, and forestry. Some actions are well underway, including the installation of 861 LED traffic signals; switching of airport ground service equipment to biodiesel; and an initiative to convert city fleets to 100% alternative fuel vehicles. A broad-based stakeholder group known as the Green Team, which includes representatives from city/state agencies, industry, academia, and environmental groups, is helping to develop this plan and guide its implementation.

DOE Says Private and Local AFV Mandates Not Necessary DOE issued a Notice of Public Rulemaking  (PDF 204  KB)  announcing that private fleet and local government fleet mandates are not necessary and therefore should not be imposed under EPAct. According to the rule, additional fleet mandates would not significantly reduce American dependence on fossil fuels.  DOE said that even if it did impose acquisition requirements, market conditions could result in their eventual suspension because there is little alternative fuel infrastructure, suitable AFVs are not available, and some alternative fuels cost more than conventional motor fuels.    The decision will apply to business fleets and local government fleets, and will eliminate potential mandates for law enforcement fleets and transit buses. However, mandates already in place for state governments and fuel provider fleets remain in force. There is a 90-day period for interested parties to submit written comments on this determination. DOE will issue its final determination in late summer or fall.   January   2003     Bush Announces Hydrogen Initiative President Bush announced a $1.2 billion  hydrogen initiative  during his State of the Union address. The initiative will include $720 million in new funding over the next five years to develop the technologies and infrastructure needed to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles and to generate electricity.  The initiative complements the President's FreedomCAR initiative, which is developing technologies needed to mass produce safe and affordable hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Through partnerships with industry, these two initiatives seek to make these vehicles cost effective for large numbers of Americans by 2020.                  The new hydrogen initiative and FreedomCAR will dramatically improve America's energy security by significantly reducing the need for imported oil, and are key components of the President's clean air and climate change strategies.  For more information about hydrogen technologies, see the   National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap .     WMPI Awarded DOE Grant to Develop Diesel Fuel The DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative grant program has approved a $100-million grant to Gilberton, Pennsylvania-based Waste Management and Processors, Inc. to develop a new program for converting coal sludge to diesel fuel with the Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid technology. The plant will be the first to commercialize this process and is expected to produce approximately 60 million gallons per day of domestic transportation fuel.     General Motors to Offer Hybrid Vehicles GM will offer hybrid options on several vehicles, starting later this year with the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups for use in commercial fleets. The hybrid versions of the trucks will increase fuel economy by 10% to 12%. The vehicles will be publicly available in 2004.  Depending on demand, GM may produce a million or more a year by 2007. In 2005, GM will begin producing a hybrid Saturn VUE sport utility. It will also include a hybrid option on its Chevy Equinox SUV in 2006 and its Chevy Malibu sedan in 2007. Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also plan hybrid models.  Buyers in some areas qualify for a federal tax deduction and local tax breaks. Even though a hybrid could cost $4,000 more than a conventional vehicle, an owner could save nearly $5,500 in gasoline expenses over the vehicle's driving life.   December  2002     NESEA Launches Online Club for AFV Owners The Northeast Sustainable Energy Association launched the new   Green Car Club Web site , which aims to provide a sense of community to owners and supporters of environmentally friendly cars. The site is designed to allow green car owners to share their experiences and find answers to questions about green vehicles, and offers an independent source of information on green cars, the latest news in green car development and new car reviews, and information on AFV equipment and fuel.       The site also offers Web-based discussion groups, a forum for exchanging performance data, driving tips, and information on public outreach activities and club-sponsored events.     American Automakers Roll Out Hybrid and Diesel Vehicles U.S. automakers, facing tougher government rules on fuel economy, tout diesel engines as a way to improve efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and cut U.S. dependence on imported oil. Additionally, hybrid electric vehicles have the attention of the public and of the U.S. Army, which sees combat versions of hybrid trucks helping to reduce its fuel demand. DaimlerChrysler will roll out a gasoline-electric Dodge Ram Contractor's Special hybrid pickup in 2003 and a diesel-powered Jeep Liberty sport-utility vehicle in 2004. It will build only about 5,000 diesel Liberty models to test consumer acceptance.  Ford plans to introduce a hybrid Escape SUV in late 2003 and GM plans to roll out a hybrid pickup in 2004.   November  2002     DOE Opens Hydrogen Fueling Station in Nevada DOE recently opened a new hydrogen energy station in Las Vegas, Nevada, that will produce both electric power and hydrogen fuel. The station is the result of a public-private partnership between DOE, the city of Las Vegas, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (which designed and constructed the facility) and Plug Power, Inc. (which manufactured and installed the site's proton exchange membrane fuel cell). The facility can dispense hydrogen, hydrogen-enriched natural gas, and compressed natural gas. The $10.8-million station features an on-site hydrogen generator and compressor, liquid and gaseous hydrogen storage tanks, dispensing systems, and a stationary fuel cell. DOE plans to join with the City of Las Vegas and NRG Technologies, Inc., to convert and operate hydrogen-powered vehicles for use at the new facility.     Toyota to Lease Fuel Cell Cars Toyota is marketing a limited number of fuel cell passenger cars. It will lease 20 cars in Japan and the United States during the coming year, which will be available to government bodies, research institutions, and energy-related companies. German-U.S. automaker DaimlerChrysler AG was the first to bring to market a limited series of fuel cell buses in 2000; Honda expects government approval to begin marketing its fuel cell vehicle in December, probably on the same day as Toyota. The Japanese government has set a goal of having 50,000 fuel cell vehicles on the road in Japan by 2010.     National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to Help Establish E85 Stations As a result of the FY 2002 Congressional Appropriation to advance the development of an E85 fueling infrastructure, the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition now has funds to help establish new public and private E85 fueling stations.   To apply for the funds, each applicant must   download a form and vendor contract  from the NEVC Web site and submit the application electronically. Any vendor that receives NEVC funds for this purpose must provide E85 for at least 4 years. Contact   Michelle Saab  at 877-485-8595 with questions.     DOE Completes Testing of Hydrogen Vehicles DOE announced that it has finished testing three hydrogen-fueled vehicles featuring internal combustion engines. The primary testing objective was to evaluate thesafety and reliability of operating vehicles on hydrogen/CNG blends. Secondary objectives included quantifying vehicle emissions, cost, and performance.      The test vehicles were a Ford F-150 pickup truck operating on as much as 50% hydrogen, an F-150 running on as much as 30% hydrogen, and a Mercedes Sprinter van fueled with 100% hydrogen. The vehicles operated safely for 26,000 miles and released extremely low emissions. Results also indicated that oil change intervals could be extended significantly.   October   2002     Ford, NCC to Provide Funds for Clean Cities National Clean Cities Inc.

GM Unveils Hywire Fuel-Cell Car, Carbon Fiber-Bodied Cars     General Motors Corporation  (GM) unveiled three concept vehicles this week at the Paris Auto Show. The most anticipated debut was that of the Hywire, GM's fuel cell-powered concept vehicle. It is fully functional and drivable, incorporates three hydrogen fuel tanks, a 94-kW fuel cell, an electric motor, and all-electric steering and braking components in an 11 inch-thick aluminum chassis. A fiberglass body connects to the chassis using 10 mechanical linkages and one electrical ""docking port"" that conveys all the control signals from the driver to the chassis. Weighing in at less than 4,200 pounds, the car sports a top speed of 99 mph. GM's Ultralite concept car counts on low weight and a minimal drag coefficient to achieve high mileage using today's fuel technologies. The carbon-fiber body allows the four-seat car to achieve a weight of only 1,400 pounds; a computer-controlled suspension gives it a drag coefficient of only 0.192. Those factors combine to yield a fuel efficiency of 84 mpg. The Ultralite features a modular drive train that can be switched between gasoline, natural gas, and electric drive systems. GM's Opel brand brought a turbo diesel approach to fuel efficiency in an aggressive sports car called the Eco-Speedster, which again features a carbon-fiber body. The 112-hp two-seater concept car achieves 94 mpg and can reach a top speed of 155 mph.      September 2002     DOE to Fund as much as $70 Million in Fuel Cell Research     DOE recently announced a solicitation for the research, development, and demonstration of fuel cell technologies. The Energy Department intends to enter into about 15 cooperative agreements with teams of industry, utility, and university partners as well as end users.   The solicitation seeks activities for stationary fuel cell systems and an economic analysis of using polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells in various stationary applications. In addition, it seeks activities that address barriers to stationary and automotive fuel cells, including improved materials for high-temperature membranes, more durable fuel cell components, new approaches for managing the water and heat produced within fuel cell stacks, and advances that reduce the cost and increase the availability of catalysts. DOE will also consider fuel cell demonstrations that have strategic value in terms of energy and environmental benefits.  For more information, refer to the  DOE news release .

Organizations located throughout California have new incentives to add electric vehicles to their fleets, provided they're located in ""environmental justice"" areas (typically communities with significant low-income or minority populations). The  California Zero Emissions Vehicle Program  offers grants of as much as $11,000 per qualifying vehicle. These grants are awarded using a competitive process.         Detroit Picked as Location for Michigan's NextEnergy Center   The Michigan Economic Development Corporation recently announced that its  NextEnergy Center  will be located in Wayne State University's Research and Technology Park in Detroit. The new center will serve as the nucleus for the NextEnergy Initiative, which is intended to help Michigan become a world leader in the research, development, commercialization, and manufacture of alternative energy technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.  The NextEnergy Initiative is taking form through a package of six legislative bills introduced to both chambers of the Michigan legislature in May. Of the six bills, three have passed into law. The first bill allows the NextEnergy Center location to be designated as a tax-free zone for the next 20 years for alternative energy companies located there. The second bill exempts alternative energy systems, vehicles, and businesses throughout the state from personal property taxes for the next 10 years. The third bill provides tax credits for all alternative energy companies in the state, with additional credits for those located within the NextEnergy Center.       EPA Provides Certification Guidance for Alternative Fuel Converters      Aftermarket parts suppliers and service providers that convert vehicles to run on gaseous alternative fuels such as CNG and LPG have received clarification of new emissions certification requirements from the EPA.   The changes stem from regulatory changes in early 2002, following the expiration of one part of EPA's Mobile Source Enforcement Memorandum 1A, widely known as Memo 1A. Previously, aftermarket converters were allowed to comply with emission standards by modifying the vehicle or engine, conducting chassis or engine dynamometer exhaust test for emission compliance, and maintaining all records related to the conversion.  The new EPA policy allows such companies to be designated as Small Volume Manufacturers, and requires emissions test data to be submitted routinely. The EPA has provided two draft documents, ""Alternative Fuels Converters Workshop, February 13, 2002 ""Potential Questions,"" and ""Test Requirements for Alternative Fuels Converters,"" that provide a revised and expanded list of questions and answers and the testing requirements for aftermarket alternative fuel converters.

You may view the  Fuel Cells Lab R&D Review Meeting  and the  Hydrogen Program Review Meeting  presentations and posters or order a CD-ROM of the proceedings.     Engineers Develop Process to Make Hydrogen from Glucose     Chemical engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a new process to  produce hydrogen from glucose , a sugar produced by many plants. The process shows particular promise because it occurs at low temperatures in the liquid phase, so it doesn't require the energy needed to heat and vaporize the glucose solution. The low temperature also yields very little carbon monoxide, which can damage fuel cells. In fact, the process produces fuel-cell-grade hydrogen in a single step. However, the researchers note that the hydrogen yields need to be improved and the catalyst cost reduced. Glucose is manufactured in vast quantities from corn starch, but can also be derived from sugar beets or low-cost waste streams like paper mill sludge, cheese whey, corn stover, or wood waste. There research was published in last week's edition of the journal  Nature .         Toyota Teams with Nissan on Hybrids      Toyota Motor Corporation recently announced that it's teaming with Nissan Motor Company, Ltd. to produce hybrid electric vehicles. Initially, Toyota will supply Nissan with a hybrid system currently under development for use in Nissan vehicles to be sold in the United States in 2006. Nissan expects to sell 100,000 hybrid vehicles per year by 2011. The partners plan to maintain a business relationship for 10 years or longer by sharing technical information and jointly developing hybrid electric components. Although Toyota is currently the largest producer of hybrid vehicles with cumulative sales of 120,000 vehicles, Nissan sold a limited number of Tino Hybrid models in 2000 and has operated a department to develop hybrid technologies since February 2001. For more information, refer to the  Toyota news release .        August    2002     Energy Secretary Visits Michigan Fuel Cell Plant  Fuel cells received recognition earlier this week when Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham toured the fuel cell/hydrogen storage technology manufacturing plant of Energy Conversion Devices (ECD), Inc. in Rochester Hills, Mich.

""President Bush has encouraged the department to undertake public-private technology partnerships in pursuit of a cleaner, more sustainable energy future that is ultimately independent of foreign sources of energy,"" Secretary Abraham told the Detroit-area audience, adding, ""The automotive industry must be one of the most important partners in this effort.""  For more information, refer to the  DOE news release .       ASTM Issues Biodiesel Fuel Standard ASTM has issued a fuel specification for biodiesel, an alternative fuel that can be made from any fat or oil, such as soybean oil. Specification D 6751, Standard Specification for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock for Distillate Fuels, applies to all biodiesel fuel bought and sold in the United States.  Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine, usually with no modifications. It performs comparably to diesel, with similar Btu content and higher cetane. It offers excellent lubricity and lower emissions than petroleum diesel.  D 6751 covers the incorporation of pure biodiesel into conventional diesel fuel up to 20% by volume. Higher blend levels may be acceptable, depending on the experience of the engine company.  Biodiesel is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as a fuel and fuel additive. Pure biodiesel is nontoxic, biodegradable, and essentially sulfur free. It reduces emissions of particulate matter, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, sulfates, and carbon dioxide. For more information, refer to the  National Biodiesel Board .      IRS Certifies HEVs for $2,000 Tax Deduction   The IRS has certified hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) as eligible for a $2,000 tax deduction offered to cleaner-burning vehicles. In a recent letter, the agency said it has determined that an HEV purchaser may rely on the certification concerning the incremental cost of permitting the use of electricity to propel the vehicle.           Purchasers can use or take this certification to their individual tax advisors to determine how they can take advantage of this important federal tax benefit. They should retain normal proof of purchase documentation and the recent correspondence as further substantiation for the federal tax deduction.    Almost 40,000 HEVs have been sold in the United States since they were introduced in 1999.

NAFTC Announces Summer Course Offerings The National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) recently announced its summer training course offerings: Natural Gas Vehicles: System Integration and Service Natural Gas Vehicles: Cylinder Inspection and Certification Propane Vehicle Training Forklift and Material Handling Applications Natural Gas Vehicles: System Integration and Service Natural Gas Vehicles: Cylinder Inspection and Certification Transient Emission Testing Refer to the ""course section"" of the  NAFTC Web site  for details, prices, and registration forms for these courses, which will be held at NAFTC headquarters in Morgantown, W.Va.     May       2002     Diesel Emission Standards, Fuel Rule Upheld The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled in favor of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), upholding its 2007 emission standards for heavy-duty diesel truck and bus engines and the ultra-low-sulfur diesel regulation.  Some refiners, engine manufacturers, and automakers challenged the rule; the court rejected arguments raised by the petitioners.  The EPA, the Department of Justice, emission control manufacturers, and environmentalists applauded the ruling. In its ruling, the court referenced DOE's  Diesel Emission Control Sulfur Effects Program .  DECSE focused on the effects of various levels of sulfur in fuel on emission exhaust control systems, which could be used to lower nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from diesel vehicles. Beginning with model year 2007, emissions from new heavy-duty diesel truck and bus engines will be reduced by more than 90 percent. Sulfur in diesel fuel must be lowered to enable modern pollution control technology to be effective on these engines. The regulation requires a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel.         DaimlerChrysler Adds Three New Flex-Fuel Vehicles to 2003 Line-Up DaimlerChrysler recently announced that it's adding three new flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) to its 2003 product line. FFVs can be fueled with E85 (a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline), gasoline, or any combination of the two fuels.    The new E85 models will include: Dodge Stratus Sedans with 2.7-liter 16-valve V-6 DOHC engines Chrysler Sebring Sedans and Convertibles with 2.7-liter 16-valve V-6 DOHC engines Dodge Cargo Minivans with 3.3-liter 16-valve V-6 SOHC engines. These new vehicles will complement DaimlerChrysler's flexible-fuel product line and give fleets covered by  Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct)  alternative fuel vehicle acquisition requirements more choices when selecting vehicles. Dodge Stratus was specifically targeted to these EPAct-mandated fleets, because buyers for this market are often interested in purchasing mid-sized vehicles. DaimlerChrysler hopes that the Stratus, a mid-compact, will fill an existing void in the FFV market.  In 2002, DaimlerChrysler's popular line of FFV minivans were sold to customers without added incremental costs for the E85-compatible engines. The 2003 additions to the DaimlerChrysler fleet of FFVs will also retail at the same price as their conventional gasoline counterparts, making them a cost effective solution for fleets that need to comply with EPAct.  For more information about the FFVs, visit the  DaimlerChrysler Fleet Web site .

Commonly used paper chemicals were allowed in the finishing and bonding of the board.     New Ford Focus Concept Vehicle Combines Hybrid and Fuel Cell Technology Ford Motor Company has developed a new four-passenger Focus concept vehicle that uses both hybrid electric and fuel cell technology. This revolutionary new zero emission vehicle was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show this week and has sparked public interest because it's one of the first to combine both types of advanced vehicle technologies. Developed by Ford's environmental TH!NK group, the Focus fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is a ""mild"" hybrid, meaning the 300-volt Sanyo battery pack augments the main power source, in this case the fuel cell, providing improved performance and added power when climbing hills or passing. A regenerative braking system recaptures energy normally lost during braking and recharges the hybrid battery system. Hybrid electric technology was first introduced in the United States by Japanese auto manufacturers Toyota and Honda with their compact Prius and Insight models. Ford will release the hybrid Escape sport utility vehicle in 2003, which employs much of the same hybrid technology featured in their Focus fuel cell vehicle.    At the heart of the Focus FCV is a Ballard Mark 902 fuel cell stack, which uses hydrogen gas to produce electricity to power the vehicle's main motor. Fuel cells produce energy from a chemical reaction that occurs when hydrogen is combined with oxygen. This process of electrical generation occurs without combustion, so the only by-products of the reaction are heat and water. A vehicle powered by a fuel cell can be highly efficient and can reduce emissions significantly. The Focus FCV also features an improved hydrogen storage tank, which can be filled to 5,000 pounds per square inch (psi), a significant improvement over the 3,600 psi of a previous version.  Together the improvement of the fuel cell and hybrid electric systems will give the four-passenger Focus FCV a range of approximately 200 miles. A fleet of five Focus FCVs have been developed for testing and evaluation by the California Fuel Cell Partnership. Ford hopes to make the Focus FCV available to customers by 2004.

February  2002     EPA Extends Deadline for Memo 1A Option 3 Memo 1A, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidance for certifying aftermarket converted vehicles, consists                      of three options for certification. Option 3, the most streamlined and cost-effective method, was set to expire at the                      end of 2001. However, in January 2002 EPA agreed to extend Option 3 through March 31, 2002 in response to various                      stakeholder concerns about vehicle converters' readiness to certify vehicles using Memo 1A Options 1 or 2. EPA is                      currently in the process of reviewing and streamlining some of these processes and procedures, and converters should                      take advantage of the extension of Option 3 to develop their own procedures for full certification.

New DECSE Report Summarizes Project Findings  A new report,  Diesel Emissions Control-Sulfur Effects Project (DECSE) Summary of Reports , describes a government                      and industry cost-shared project to determine the impact of fuel sulfur levels on emission control systems that could be                      used to lower emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from compression ignition, direct injection diesel                      vehicles. The sulfur in diesel fuel adversely affects the operation of diesel exhaust emission control systems. Tests were                      conducted and data collected and analyzed for various combinations of fuel sulfur levels, engines, and exhaust emission                      control systems. To view this report, visit  www.ott.doe.gov/decse .             New Study Highlights Barriers Facing Fuel Cell Vehicles   A new study released by the Environmental Defense Council highlights some of the  barriers facing the automotive industry's commercialization of fuel cell vehicles.  Produced by senior fellow John DeCicco,  Fuel Cell Vehicles: Technology,  Market, and Policy Issues  identifies these barriers and calls on the automotive industry to take a proactive approach in addressing them. While several manufacturers have made the commitment to putting fuel cell vehicles on the road by 2005, the report identifies a gap of an additional 10 - 15 years before it is economically feasible to mass market them. DeCicco points out that the absence of higher fuel economy requirements for the industry will inevitably slow the development of fuel cell technology and concludes that the quickest way to close this ""deployability gap"" is for the automotive industry to address the fuel economy issue.  Full Story .         New Fact Sheets Shed Light on Advanced Vehicle Technologies How does a fuel cell work? How clean are hybrid electric vehicles? How is ethanol made? A collection of new fact sheets answers these and other questions about technologies being developed through the DOE Office of Transportation Technologies. The  fact sheets  provide overviews on fuel cells, diesel engines, electric vehicles, biodiesel, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, and natural gas.          January   2002     AVS Electric Buses to Begin Service in Lower Manhattan  Advanced Vehicle Systems (AVS) of Chattanooga, Tenn., announced the sale of eight UltraPower electric buses to New York City. These zero emission vehicles will provide shuttle service to routes in lower Manhattan, and improve access to businesses and restaurants in the area devastated by the Word Trade Center bombings. The AVS UltraPower bus uses a new energy storage technology that combines traditional batteries with ultracapacitors. This combination of batteries and ultracapacitors will help increase both the life and efficiency of the system by allowing the bus to go through more charging cycles.  Use of the new energy storage system will also increase the amount of ""free"" energy that can be recovered from regenerative braking in stop-and-go city traffic. New buses are expected to begin service in the downtown area by next summer.        Millenium Hydrogen Fuel Cell System Powers DaimlerChrysler Minivan DaimlerChrysler unveiled its new fuel cell Town and Country Natrium minivan at the Electric Transportation Industry Conference and Exposition in Sacramento, Calif. This third-generation fuel cell-powered automobile is the first of its kind to integrate an on-demand hydrogen system that is contained on-board the vehicle. It's also the first fuel cell vehicle capable of traveling as far as 300 miles without refueling. The production of the fuel cell Natrium involved over 18 months of collaboration between DaimlerChrysler's Liberty and Technical Affairs Group and Millennium Cell Inc., developers of the on-board hydrogen fuel system.  Millennium Cell's on-demand fuel system uses a material derived from sodium borate (more commonly known as borax) to produce the hydrogen used to power the fuel cell. Electricity generated from the chemical reaction that takes place inside the fuel cell is then used to run the vehicle's electric motors. Borax is an environmentally friendly material that can be found in abundant quantities throughout the world.  Full Story .         Bush Administration Backs Fuel Cells, Cuts Fuel Efficient Vehicle Program Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced that the Bush Administration plans to help American automakers develop fuel cell cars that run on hydrogen. Abraham's announcement was made at the Detroit Auto Show where the big three U.S. automakers  rolled out their futuristic fuel cell concept cars. Bush's FreedomCAR program will help U.S. auto manufacturers produce less expensive, more efficient, and more reliable versions of their fuel cell concept vehicles. If successful, the program could bring  an end to the internal combustion engine that has dominated American roads for more than a century.  The shift to a hydrogen-based transportation economy would also mean an end to U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and the elimination of pollution caused by vehicle emissions. Fuel cells produce energy from a chemical reaction that occurs when hydrogen is combined with oxygen. When pure hydrogen is used, heat and water are the only byproducts of the reaction. The FreedomCAR project supercedes the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, which was established in 1993 as a joint venture between the government and the big three domestic automakers. See the  DOE press release .     New York Spending $4.2 Million on Clean-Fueled Buses  On December 26, 2001, Governor George Pataki announced that the state will use $4.2 million in Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act funds to purchase 128 compressed natural gas buses and 35 hybrid electric buses for use in New York City, Syracuse, and Long Island. The Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act funding is targeted at reducing pollution in urban areas and curtailing the state's greenhouse gas emissions. Purchase of the buses also will provide significant economic benefits for a number of upstate manufacturers. More information is available at  www.nyserda.org/pressother2001.html .          CEC Funds Natural Gas and Propane Refueling Stations The California Energy Commission (CEC) announced that it would provide grants to help build natural gas and propane refueling stations for public vehicle fleets in the state.

In fact, recent data indicate that older adults are in the highest risk category for crashes when figures are based on crashes per number of miles driven.   Among the senses, the importance of vision is paramount.  To respond appropriately to all manner of stimuli in the roadway environment, a driver must first detect and recognize physical features of the roadway, traffic control devices, other vehicles, pedestrians, and a wide variety of other objects and potential hazards of a static and dynamic nature.  On rare occasions, critical information concerning the presence or position of traffic is conveyed to a road user solely through an auditory signal; in the vast majority of cases, however, the visual system is preeminent at this (input) stage of processing.      Age-related changes in the lens of the eye, combined with pathology (for example, glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration) result in the diminished capabilities that are described below.     Reductions in Acuity     This is the  ability needed to discriminate high contrast features; it is necessary for reading information on road signs.  Visual acuity of 20/40 with or without corrective lenses for both eyes or one blind eye is the predominant minimum standard for driver licensing for passenger car drivers throughout the U.S.  However, there are an increasing number of states (including Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Florida, Illinois, and others) that will grant a restricted license to low-vision drivers with acuities as poor as 20/70 to 20/100.  Restrictions may include daytime only, area, and speed limitations.  Added to reductions in acuity, aging is also associated with yellowing of the eyes' lenses and increased density (or thickening).  This affects the way color is perceived and also reduces the amount of light that reaches the retina, which makes  seeing in low light conditions more difficult.      Reductions in Contrast Sensitivity        This is the ability needed to detect low-contrast features; it is necessary to, for example for see worn lane lines, detect (non retroreflectorized) curbs and median boundaries, and  see other road users at dusk.  Some people have 20/20 acuity but still have ""cloudy"" or washed-out vision.  Contrast sensitivity makes it possible to distinguish an object from its background. It begins to decline after about age 40, as a result of normal aging.    Individuals age 61+ have an increasing risk for the development of cataracts and other sight-threatening or visually disabling eye conditions that reduce contrast sensitivity.  Many people with reductions in contrast sensitivity are not aware that their vision is impaired, and contrast sensitivity is not a standard test in most DMVs for licensing.    Reductions in   Visual Field    This is the ability to see objects in the periphery; it is necessary for detecting signs, signals, vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., outside of a limited field of view directly ahead.  A limitation in visual field size is a physiological limitation--the person's visual system is not capable of detecting a stimulus outside of his or her visual field.    Restrictions in the Area of Visual Attention     This    is the ability to see potential conflicts in the periphery, and to discriminate    relevant from irrelevant information; it is necessary for responding quickly    and appropriately to a constantly changing traffic scene. Sometimes    termed ""useful field of view,"" ""functional field of view, "" or ""attentional    window,"" this refers to a subset of the total field of view.    Restrictions in the area of visual attention can lead to ""looked but didn't    see"" crashes, where stimuli can be    detected, but cannot be recognized and understood sufficiently to permit a timely    driver response. As such, this term represents a limitation at the attentional    stage of visual information processing, rather than a physiological limitation.        Increased Sensitivity to Glare     This refers to the ability to see in the presence of oncoming headlights, at night, or in the presence of sun glare in daytime.  Glare introduces stray light into the eye; it  reduces the contrast of important safety targets.    Slower Dark Adaptation    This is the ability needed to see targets when moving from areas of light to dark, which may occur at highway interchanges or moving from commercialized areas to non-commercialized areas.    Decreased Motion Sensitivity     This ability is needed to accurately estimate closing speeds and distances; it is necessary, for example, for judging gaps to safely perform left turns at intersections with oncoming traffic, to cross an intersecting traffic stream from a minor road or driveway, or to merge with traffic.     Compounding the varied age-related deficits in visual performance that are a part of normal aging, an overall slowing of mental processes occurs as individuals continue to age into their seventies and beyond.  Declines have been demonstrated in a number of specific mental activities that are related to driver and pedestrian safety, such as attentional, decisional, and response-selection functions.  These are described below.    Selective Attention     This refers to the ability to filter out less critical information and continuously re-focus on the most critical information (for example, detecting a lane-use restricted message on an approach to a busy intersection; detecting a pedestrian crossing while watching oncoming traffic to locate a safe gap).    Divided Attention     This refers to the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and process information from multiple sources (for example, lane-keeping, reading signs, noticing traffic signals and  changing phases, while maintaining a safe headway with other traffic during an intersection approach).    Perception-Reaction Time (PRT)     This is the time required to make a decision about what response is appropriate  for specific highway design elements and traffic conditions, and then make a vehicle control movement such as steering and/or braking.  As the overall speed of mental processing of information slows with aging, PRT increases.  As the complexity of the driving situation increases, PRT increases disproportionately for older motorists.    Working Memory    This refers to the ability to store,  manipulate,  and retrieve information for later use while driving (for example, carrying out a series of navigational instructions while negotiating in heavy traffic; or remembering, integrating, and understanding successive phases of a changeable message sign).     Finally, it has been well established that physical capabilities decline as a function of age and also as a function of general health. Aging (as well as disease and disuse) brings about changes in the components and structure of the cartilage near the joints, underlying bones, ligaments and muscles.  These changes impair the ability of the musculoskeletal system to perform driving acts.  The physical capabilities (motor functions) needed for safe and effective vehicle control are  described below.    Limb Strength, Flexibility, Sensitivity, and/or Range of Motion     These abilities are needed to quickly shift (the right foot) from accelerator to brake pedal when the situation demands, and apply correct pressure for appropriate speed control; also, for arm movements to safely maneuver the car around obstacles.    Head/Neck and Trunk Flexibility     A key ability of a driver is to rapidly glance in each direction from which a vehicle conflict may be expected in a given situation; this includes the familiar ""left-right-left"" check before crossing an intersection, as well as looking over one's shoulder before merging with traffic or changing lanes.    DRIVER LICENSE RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS     State license renewal requirements for passenger car drivers in the United States are presented below.  Many States allow mail-in license renewal,  although  a subset of these prohibit mail-in renewals for drivers over a certain age.  On the other extreme, Florida requires in-person renewal at  every third cycle , which means that a driver with a clean record will not step foot into a DMV for 18 years (or 12 years for an unclean record).  Petrucelli and Malinowski (1992) state that ""the examiner's personal contact with the applicant is the only routine opportunity to detect potential problems of the functionally impaired driver.""   There are also differences in license renewal testing requirements (vision, written knowledge, and on-road driving) across the United States.  General visual acuity requirements for driver licensing are included in this table; however, most States also have a visual field requirement that is not included in this table.  Specific driver licensing requirements may be obtained by accessing each State's Department of Motor Vehicles website.

MEASURING THE VISIBILITY OF HIGHWAY TREATMENTS     The visibility of highway treatments providing guidance information to motorists is critical, particularly for nighttime operations.  Guidance information is needed sufficiently in advance of any change in roadway heading, to allow the driver to plan and execute steering and speed control movements smoothly as needed for path maintenance.  Taking into account the diminished visual, attentional, and perceptual-cognitive abilities associated with normal aging as documented in the  Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians , a 5-s preview distance (at operating speeds) is regarded as the  minimum  for which visibility requirements should be established, and for high-speed operations a preview distance or 7 to 10 seconds or more may be advisable.     Treatments rendered visible by reflected light include all non-internally    illuminated targets, such as pavement markings, raised pavement markers, vertical    (post-mounted) delineators, and highway signs. At nighttime, these treatments    are illuminated by vehicle headlights, and light is  returned    (reflected) principally back in the direction of the driver's eye; as illustrated    in the drawing to the right, this property denotes the characteristic of  retroreflectivity .    According to the  MUTCD , markings that must be visible at night should    be retroreflective unless ambient illumination assures adequate visibility.    The recommendations contained within the  Highway Design Handbook for Older    Drivers and Pedestrians  are intended to improve the visibility of retroreflectorized    pavement markings used to delineate lane and roadway boundaries, curbs, medians,    and other raised surfaces, and to channelize traffic in the vicinity of intersections.     General principles of retroreflection, as well as driver visibility needs, are discussed at length in the FHWA  Roadway Delineation Practices Handbook  (Migletz, Fish, and Graham, 1994), and the interested reader is encouraged to consult that resource.  Before turning to measurement techniques, however, several key points deserve emphasis.     First, the human visual system is capable of discriminating an object against its background only when a threshold level of  contrast  has been reached.  While color contrast is important in certain contexts, it is the relative brightness of the visual target (e.g., pavement striping) against the surrounding area (the road surface) that is most critical.  The brightness of an object rendered visible by reflected light is described by its  luminance  (L) level.  Contrast (C) is commonly defined as the ratio of an object's luminance minus the luminance of the surrounding area, relative to the surrounding area alone, and is thus calculated according to the formula:                Luminance contrast, dependent as it is on reflected light, varies according to  many factors.  Some relationships affecting contrast thresholds for target detection are crosscutting, however.  The human visual system is less sensitive to contrast as the ambient light level decreases; and, the human visual system is less sensitive to contrast as a consequence of normal aging.  Therefore, moving from daylight through twilight and dusk to nightfall, more contrast is required to see a given target; and, this increment is significantly greater for older drivers than for younger drivers.  This means that the contrast of critical safety targets such as lane and road boundaries must be maintained at higher levels to accommodate the needs of older drivers, especially at night.     Considerable research has been conducted by FHWA and others to develop specifications for retroreflective materials to return sufficient light to a driver's eyes (from a target at a specified distance and angular relationship to the driver, and illuminated by a specified light source) to ensure a contrast level above the threshold for detection (Ziskind, Mace, Staplin, Sim, and Lococo, 1991; Mercier, Goodspeed, Simmons, and Paniati, 1995; Zwahlen and Schnell, 1999, 2000).  The retroreflective performance of pavement markings, which is a property of the materials from which they are fabricated, is measured in the (metric) units of millicandela per square meter per lux (mcd/m 2 /lx).  This measure also denotes the coefficient of retroreflected light (R L ).  Higher values of R L  for a material indicate higher (installed) brightness levels when viewed by an observer/driver at a specified angular relationship with the light source and target.  Two angles are key to this relationship, the angle between the light source, the observer, and the target surface, and the angle between the incident light path and a reference axis normal to the surface of the target. These are, respectively, labeled the  observation angle  and the  entrance angle , as represented in the drawing below:                     For entrance angles less than 30, R L  is much more sensitive to the observation angle.  The observation angle is a function of the distance a vehicle is from the target illuminated by its headlights, and the height of both the headlights and the driver's eyes above the road surface.  For an assumed driver eye height of 1.45 m (57 in), headlight height of 0.61 to 0.71 m (24 to 28 in), and detection distance of approximately 80 m (260 ft) -- chosen to afford a 5 s preview at a speed of 56 km/h (35 mi/h) -- the observation angle is 1.  In fact, the observation angles for pavement treatments for the full range of road types and operating speeds of interest fall within a one-degree span, from 0.5 to 1.5.  Since driver eye height and headlight position do not change, the critical variable is the preview distance at which a target must be visible to the motorist for safe vehicle control.    Retroreflective materials used for pavement treatments are designed to return enough light  from headlight illumination to a driver under a defined viewing geometry, as noted above, that their contrast is well above threshold.  Specifically, the performance requirement for a given material is defined by the amount that the contrast obtained under a set of reference viewing conditions exceeds threshold contrast.  This performance requirement is confirmed through laboratory and or field measurements, using an  instrument (a  retroreflectometer ) with an internal light source and a means of control over the entrance and observation angles when the instrument is applied to the to-be-measured surface.  Such measurements yield the amount of light (luminance intensity) that is reflected in the desired direction.  If the performance specification for the material is met, it is assumed that a level of contrast resulting in a high probability of detection will also be obtained.     Emerging retroreflectivity standards for various highway signing and marking applications from FHWA hold the promise of significantly improving the visibility of these treatments,  if  extended to include maintained levels of performance as well as a specification for performance at the time of installation.  Even with this development, however, there are concerns with the measurement of retroreflectivity, concerns that are serious enough that a supplementary approach has been recommended in this Handbook.      One concern is with the required precision of measurement using a retroreflectometer.  As stated above, retroreflectivity is quite sensitive to small changes in observation angle.  Field experience by the Handbook authors with portable retroreflectometers indicates that adjustments in this measurement parameter can be both unreliable and unstable.  The calibration of the unit also must be checked periodically to insure valid measurements.  More sophisticated, mobile measurement systems have been developed, but these are expensive and may not be available in a local jurisdiction.     Another concern with relying solely on the measurement of retroreflectivity level, is that it is a mediating variable from which inferences about visibility are made, rather than a direct measure of available  contrast.  The seminal FHWA study in this area concluded, "" the practical value of guidelines  [ for minimum visibility requirements for traffic control devices ]  will be determined as much as anything else by their simplicity""  (Ziskind et al., 1991).  It is the contrast of the treatment, when viewed by a driver under the particular conditions of interest, that is fundamental to its visibility and probability of detection.  Therefore, if it is feasible to directly measure luminance contrast, this would be a preferred practice for ensuring maintained levels of visibility to accommodate the needs of older drivers.  A field methodology for such measurements is diagrammed on the following page using, as an example, an observation angle of 1.     Using a hand-held light meter, or photometer, a technician can obtain luminance readings from a pavement treatment and from the adjacent roadway surface (background), then perform the contrast calculation shown on page 75.  Several suitable instruments offering the convenience of through-the-lens aiming are commercially available at a cost of less than $3,000.                             Photometric measurements should be obtained under the conditions of interest.    For example, if the question is whether a treatment provides a desired level    of contrast at a 5-s preview distance under low beam headlight illumination    at night, these are the conditions under which luminance measurements should    be obtained. The technician operating the photometer could be located whichever    is most convenient, either in the vehicle or outside, provided that a large    enough target area is viewable using the smallest aperture on the photometer.    If positioned outside, as diagrammed above, care should be taken not to interpose    oneself directly between the light source (headlights) and the to-be-measured    pavement treatment. However, because light is reflected in a cone from a given    point on the retroreflective surface, the technician may move laterally a small    distance and still obtain valid measurements. And because  the intensity    of light reflected from the treatment (i.e., luminance) will be the same at    any measurement distance , the only essential requirement is to select  x     and  y  values using the formula  arctan y/x  that afford the    desired observation angle. This means that as one moves nearer the treatment,    the photometer must be held somewhat closer to the pavement surface to preserve    the observation angle. Observation angles affording a 5-s preview distance at    varying speeds are:                          1.0 at 56 km/h (35 mi/h)            0.7 at 89 km/h (55 mi/h)                       0.8 at 72 km/h (45 mi/h)           0.6 at 105 km/h (65 mi/h)              With the information above, the vertical distance above the pavement ( y )  at which the photometer should be held is easily calculated for a given longitudinal  separation ( x ) from the treatment, for a constant observation angle.    In summary, emerging retroreflectivity standards are expected to serve as    a useful metric to insure adequate visibility of highway treatments at the time    of installation. It is the maintained visibility of these treatments that will    most important for safe operation, however. To confirm that a sufficient level    of luminance contrast to accommodate older drivers is afforded by a treatment    under a specified operating condition, field measurements using the methodology    outlined above are recommended.

NETL Publishes Fuel Cell Fact Sheet  The National Energy Technology Laboratory has published a fact sheet titled,   DOE's Fuel Cell Research Targets National Goals for Energy and the Environment , which details its fuel cell research and how that research correlates to three federal initiatives for energy and the environment: (1) Clear Skies Initiative, a comprehensive policy to reduce sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions from the power generation sector; (2) Climate Change Initiative, which has the goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce GHG intensity 18% by 2012; and (3) Energy Security, which seeks to diversify energy resources, develop new technologies for distributed power, promote conservation, use domestic energy resources, and modernize energy delivery systems.     Workshop Tackles Biological Hydrogen Production  The results of a two-day workshop on  hydrogen production through biological and artificial systems  are now available. The workshop was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and hosted jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory.      The primary objective of the workshop was to define the future roles of biotechnology, biomimetic chemistry, and artificial photosynthesis in the development of innovative hydrogen production technologies.      Research into the sustainable production of hydrogen is crucial to the nation's future as the country moves toward energy independence. A better understanding of the organisms and biological processes that produce hydrogen naturally could lead to sustainable methods of producing hydrogen from sunlight and water. These might include totally artificial processes that mimic biology.      The workshop participants also identified important scientific challenges and a set of short- and long-term goals for research relating to hydrogen production.      Fossil Energy Web Site Highlights Hydrogen The U.S. Department of Energy's  Fossil Energy Web site  now has a section titled, Hydrogen and Other Clean Fuels. Readers can access information about President Bush's Hydrogen Initiative; technologies for producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, natural gas, and coal; and methods for delivering hydrogen. It discusses current technologies such as steam reforming of natural gas, as well as emerging hydrogen production technologies.     Agriculture Conference Call for Papers  The Farm Foundation and the USDA Office of Energy Policy and New Uses are sponsoring a conference titled, Agriculture as a Producer and Consumer of Energy, to be held June 24-25, 2004 in Arlington, Virginia. It is designed to establish a baseline of information on the current status of agriculture as a producer and consumer of energy. Selected papers will be organized in two tracks:       Agriculture's Role as an Energy Producer: U.S. agriculture has the resources to produce many forms of bioenergy, including liquid fuels like ethanol and biodiesel, electricity produced from energy crops and crop residues, and methane gas produced from anaerobic digestion.       Agriculture's Role as an Energy Consumer: U.S. agriculture relies on many forms of energy, including diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas, liquid petroleum. and electricity. Farmers also use significant amounts of energy indirectly via energy-intensive farm inputs such as commercial fertilizers and pesticides. Papers that deal with energy used on farms, livestock and poultry operations, nurseries, greenhouses, and other agricultural operations are of interest, as are those that discuss the energy used to manufacture farm inputs and that used in food manufacturing, packaging, and transportation.       Proposals must be submitted via e-mail to  Dr. Joe Outlaw  no later than Friday, January 16, 2004. The proposal must be attached to the e-mail as a Word or WordPerfect file. For details on format, acceptance, and publication, visit the  Farm Foundation Web site .      Contact  Dr. Steve A. Halbrook  at 630-571-9393 or  Dr. Joe Outlaw  at 979-845-3062 with questions.       Propane School Bus Unveiled  The first dedicated propane school bus was unveiled at the Annual Conference and Trade Show of the National Association for Pupil Transportation. Built by Corbeil Bus, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis. It was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, with support from ProCon (a consortium of propane providers and equipment manufacturers), the Propane Vehicle Council, and the Propane Education & Research Council.    The school bus is a technology enhanced aftermarket model that features an 8.1-liter gasoline engine, now engineered to a dedicated propane system. It features a GMT 233 WB chassis, a cutaway chassis with a truck front end. The bus can be equipped to meet the needs of physically challenged students and is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.     The frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank manifold with a total usable capacity of more than 50 gallons of propane fuel. The manifold enables better packaging and delivery of propane fuel and is positioned between the frame rails to provide a robust and secure environment for durability and safety. The vehicle will be certified for all state, EPA, and CARB ULEV emission standards.     School districts in Texas, Oregon, and California have indicated their desire to order the new propane school bus. ProCon will accept orders from customers immediately.  Delivery is expected around May 2004.     First Clean-Fueled Snow Plow Truck Arrives on Long Island The New York State Department of Transportation retrofitted nine vehicles, including four snowplows and five medium-duty dump trucks, with clean-burning engines fueled by a 80% compressed natural gas and 20% diesel fuel. The first snowplow, unveiled at the seventh annual Alternative Fuel Vehicle Conference sponsored by the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition, has arrived on Long Island. The other snowplows, as well as five medium-duty dump trucks, are expected to be completed and delivered to the Long Island region by late spring 2004.  The trucks are being retrofitted under a $500,000 grant secured by NYSERDA, at a cost of approximately $28,000 per vehicle. They are being tested in Suffolk County, where they will help meet clean air goals.  During a seven-year period, each truck is expected to emit 3,000 pounds less nitrogen oxides and 90 pounds less particulate matter, reductions of 40% and 95%, respectively, and to reduce diesel fuel use by about 5,140 gallons per year.      Dedicated Propane Low-Floor Bus Chassis Unveiled The propane industry unveiled the first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis at BusCon 2003.  Built by Heart International, with funding from the Propane Education & Research Council and the U.S. Department of Energy, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis with an 8.1 liter engine, engineered now to run on a dedicated propane system.  The Propane Promotion Consortium and the Propane Vehicle Council provided additional support to the project. The low-floor bus uses the Heart International kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the bus doors open.  With this technology and its completely flat, step-less interior, the bus complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and provides easy navigation for persons with strollers. Two body frame versionsone for park services and another for mass transit and airport shuttle serviceswill be offered.      Metro Denver Opens First Retail Biodiesel Fueling Station Trucking fleets, school districts, and diesel vehicle owners in the metro Denver area will soon have a convenient local source of biodiesel.  Blue Sun Biodiesel and Shoco Oil, Inc., announced the grand opening of Denver's first retail biodiesel fueling station in Commerce City. Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing biodiesel energy crops and infrastructure in cooperation with regional farmers, and implementing state-of-the art production and distribution facilities.  The Shoco Oil Commerce City facility is a 12-acre commercial fueling center that provides gasoline, on and off road diesel fuel, and quality lubricants.  Shoco currently services agricultural, construction, mining, school districts, and government fleets statewide.   Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing regional farmer cooperatives to produce biodiesel feedstock from crops adapted to arid high plains growing conditions. There are 5.6 million acres of dryland winter wheat in the region, and oilseed crops added to the rotation could bring farmers an additional $280 million in revenues per year.  As a domestic source of energy that reduces harmful emissions and greenhouse gases, biodiesel will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our health and environment.     Low-Floor Bus Chassis Ready for Ordering The first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis was built by Heart International, with funding from PERC and DOE, and additional support from ProCon and the Propane Vehicle Council. The width of the frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank module with a total usable capacity of 65 gallons of propane fuel. It is an environmentally friendly low-floor bus that effectively caters to the needs of mass transit, parks, and airport shuttle services.  The low-floor bus uses kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the doors open, while still employing rear-wheel-drive reliability. The frame is lowered 14 inches. Modified front leaf springs and auxiliary air springs lower the cab two inches and provide standard front kneeling, in addition to improved steering control. Independent rear suspension, which uses a twist channel beam suspension, provides greater flexibility than a solid rear axle. Rear air springs provide optional kneeling in any direction when combined with the standard auxiliary front air springs.  A completely flat, step-less interior allows the bus to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Access for persons in wheelchairs and with strollers is at the same entry point as for all other passengers.    October   2003     Trolleys to Roll in Downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana The Capitol Park Trolley, a new natural gas trolley system for the downtown Baton Rouge area, will provide efficient transportation for visitors and for those working in the area. It will also be an incentive to patronize downtown businesses, thus helping revitalize downtown. The trolley, the first mass transit program in Louisiana to operate on natural gas, will run Monday through Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and will be free.  Initially, the route will run from the Sheraton, north down River Road, up to Third Street to the north end of Capitol Park, south down Fourth Street and back around to the Sheraton.  There are approximately 15 convenient stops on the route and the waiting period to catch a trolley is estimated to be six minutes.  Funding for the project was identified in May 2003 through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds.  The Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with Plan Baton Rouge, the Downtown Development District, and Capital Transportation Corporation, worked to secure approvals for funding from the Mayor's Office, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, and the Federal Transit Authority.  The cost of the three-year project is approximately $1.6 million for infrastructure, operation and maintenance costs: $1.3 million in federal CMAQ funds and $300,000 in state matching funds. The State and the Capital Transportation Corporation have entered into a cooperative endeavor agreement to operate the service for three years with the option to expand service when deemed necessary and additional funding becomes available.       Kansas-Grown Fuel Available at the Pump The first fueling station in Wichita to offer E85 has opened at The new Kwik Shop. The number of ethanol-producing plants in Kansas has increased, but the state has been slower than others in the Midwest to make ethanol blends available. Kansas has five operating ethanol plants: Abengoa, U.S. Energy Partners at Russell, MGP at Atchison, Reeves AgriEnergy at Garden City, and ESE at Leoti. All but MGP use either corn or grain sorghum as feedstock.  MGP uses wheat to produce gluten, fuel ethanol, and beverage alcohol. A dozen more plants are in the works or under consideration. The legislature has provided new incentives for ethanol use and state cars now burn ethanol blends.  In addition, new cars purchased for the state fleet will be capable of burning E85.     Monsanto, GM, and NEVC Partner for E85 Infrastructure The Monsanto Company recently announced a multi-million dollar, two-year partnership among General Motors and the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to establish new E85 fueling locations and to deliver improved corn for the dry mill ethanol industry.    As a part of this initative, Monsanto is launching a new program titled Fuel Your Profits, a processor preferred high fermentable corn solutions package offered to dry mill ethanol plants and corn growers.  Growers can participate by selecting an enrolled dry mill ethanol plant, then committing to plant and deliver the grain over the next two years.  Producers will then be eligible to receive discounts on GM flexible-fuel vehicles and an E85 fueling location.   GM has more than one million vehicles on the road that can burn E85, and has increased ethanol demand through its E85 awareness efforts with NEVC. The NEVC is committed to advancing ethanol, E85 use, and the ethanol infrastructure.  This program with Monsanto and GM will increase availability of E85 fueling sites and increase demand for E85 as farmers acquire GM flexible-fuel vehicles.      USDA Provides Biodiesel Fuel Education Program Grants The National Biodiesel Board and the University of Idaho will receive $960,000 from the USDA to conduct a biodiesel fuel education program. The National Biodiesel Board was awarded $770,000 to create educational programming and the University of Idaho was awarded $190,000 to provide technical support for the effort. The purpose of the grants, which were competitively awarded, is to develop an educational program to target governmental and private entities that operate vehicle fleets. The program will address issues previously identified by fleet operators and other potential fuel users, including the need to balance the positive environmental, social, and human health effects of biodiesel consumption with the increased cost per gallon. These grants will also be used to inform other interested groups and the public about biodiesel use.      Knoxville Adds Propane Hybrid Trolleys to AFV Fleet The  East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition (ETCFC)  recently announced that Knoxville Area Transit (KAT) will soon debut four propane-powered hybrid electric trolleys to serve downtown Knoxville as part of KAT's Clean Fuels Program.            KAT currently operates five dedicated propane vans that serve the University of Tennessee, and aims to operate almost completely on alternative fuels within the next five years. KAT's plans call for vans, trolleys, and possibly some buses to run on propane, and for some buses to operate on B20.        The first hybrid electric trolley is scheduled to begin operating in October; the remainder are set to begin service in December.     GEM Donates 75 Vehicles to City of Boston and 2004 Democratic Convention Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, donated 75 vehicles to the City of Boston and the 2004 Democratic convention. The donation completes a program in which more than 2,000 GEM vehicles have been provided to municipalities and charitable and service organizations.  GEMs are classified by the federal government as low speed vehicles, and have a top speed of 25 mph. They are alternatives to full-size automobiles for short trips, and are primary people movers on corporate, academic, and military campuses.  GEMs went into production four years ago, and now more than 26,000 are on roads with 35 mph or lower speed limits across the country.      1st Annual University Student Hydrogen Design Contest To help develop the hydrogen economy and engage students in the progression of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, the National Hydrogen Association and the U.S. Department of Energy are looking for innovative and imaginative designs for a next-generation hydrogen fueling station.  Teams of graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in North American colleges and universities for the 2003-2004 academic year are invited to participate in the    1st Annual University Student Hydrogen Design Contest . It requires creativity and knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including design/architecture, engineering, economics, environmental and physical sciences, business, and others.  The projects will be evaluated on technical, scientific, environmental, and economic analyses, incorporation of novel technology, and overall quality of the final submittal. Entries will likely include a detailed description or analysis of the hydrogen production/distribution/storage technologies incorporated by the design. Selections are expected to include one winning team and four honorable mention teams. The winning team will receive an all expense paid trip to Hollywood, California, to present its winning design at a plenary session of the 2004 NHA Annual Conference. The four honorable mention teams will be invited to give poster presentations of their work and will receive free conference registration and materials. All five teams will receive awards at a ceremony preceding the presentation of the winning entry.    September 2003     Lansing, Michigan, Joins DOE's Clean Cities Program DOE designated the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition as the newest member of its Clean Cities Program on September 26. Earning such a designation from the program is not a simple task: The Lansing group has been working for seven years to advance the use of alternative fuels in the area. After the City of Lansing partnered with St. Johns and other area communities and groups, DOE helped the coalition to build a market foundation for alternative fuel vehicles, form its own group of stakeholders, hold meetings, identify a coordinator, define goals, and develop an action plan to achieve those goals. The Clean Cities designation recognizes the coalition as working to strengthen the nation's energy security, improve air quality and stimulate the local economy by creating new alternative fuel markets. See the  September 26 press release  on the DOE Web site.     Green Cars Start Their Engines Numerous automakers, as well as a few tinkerers, showcased 100 environmentally friendly cars and trucks at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. The vehicles, including plug-in electrics, hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and diesels, were put through testing for this eco-vehicle gathering. Japanese automakers are focusing on hybrids, and American manufacturers are promoting vehicles that would replace the internal combustion engine with fuel cells. European carmakers are focusing on diesel engines.         The vehicles were tested on drive by noise, fuel efficiency, exhaust emissions, acceleration, braking, slalom driving, and fuel efficiency. The friendly competition included an individual who spent $5,000 to convert a pickup truck to run on hydrogen, natural gas, propane, and gasoline, as well as any combination. Test drives of futuristic fuel cell prototypes were also offered.      Innovative Transit Bus Focuses on the Future The   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  is collaborating with other government agencies and the automotive industry to develop a bus that is designed to capture the nostalgia and appeal of the buses driven in Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s. The new yellow bus carries 16 to 32 passengers, can use an alternative fuel, features a low floor, and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.    The bus is built on a General Motors T-560 medium-duty chassis with a gross vehicle weight of 19,000-26,000 pounds. It took three years to design and build. Instead of conventional shocks, the bus rides on compressed air, which is released to lower the bus for boarding. It is designed to run on natural gas. Eventually, similar buses will be manufactured using several optional engines, to allow use of alternative fuels like natural gas, propane, ethanol, and biodiesel. Its purposes are to protect the national park's pristine environment and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.      Biodiesel Carries New Weight Premium The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) has passed a new definition for premium diesel, and the changes are good news for biodiesel. Lubricity is now is considered in determining whether a fuel can be classified as a premium diesel fuel. Independent tests show just 1% biodiesel can increase the lubricity of petroleum diesel by as much as 65%.  The NCWM list now includes cetane, cold flow properties, thermal stability, and lubricity. This important development makes the positive lubricity benefit of biodiesel a premium attribute. The changes will appear in the 2004 NIST Handbook 130.   August    2003     Pump Lets Natural Gas Civics Go to Market In 2004 Honda will begin mass-marketing natural gas-powered Civics that will come with a device to fill the tank in a garage. This is the first time an automaker will sell a natural gas vehicle broadly to the public. Until now, sales have been mostly limited to specialized fleets such as airport vans and university campus vehicles. Since 1998, Honda has sold 500 to 1,000 natural gas Civic GX models per year to customers such as the New York Department of Transportation. They are popular for commercial fleets that travel short distances and have their own filling stations. The drawback to widespread sales has been the lack of an easy, reliable way to fuel the vehicles. Honda will sell an appliance, called Phill, with each Civic GX to fill the tank from a home gas line. Phill will cost $2,000, but tax credits may knock the end cost down to $1,000. The Civic GX will cost about $20,000. Honda views the market as mostly second and commuter cars.   Phill, made by Toronto-based Fuelmaker, requires 8 hours to half-fill a vehicle, good for 100 miles. GX owners also can refill at approximately 1,300 natural gas stations nationwide. Filling stations that dispense compressed natural gas under pressure can fill a tank in three to five minutes.Running a vehicle on natural gas historically costs about 80% of what it costs to run on gasoline.  Honda views natural gas as a critical bridge to acceptance of hydrogen-powered vehicles it expects to sell in large numbers by 2015. By putting Phills in garages, Honda hopes people will accept the idea of hydrogen fuel cell generators in their garages later. Compared with gasoline, natural gas emits 70% less carbon monoxide, 87% less nitrogen oxide, and 20% less carbon dioxide.      New E85 Tank in Amarillo, Texas The second E85 station in Texas will soon be pumping E85. The new 10,000-gallon E85 tank is located near Amarillo, Texas, and also offers biodiesel and unleaded gasoline for its 300-vehicle fleet.  BWXT Pantex, which manages and operates the Pantex nuclear weapons facility for the National Nuclear Security Administration, will initially use E85 in about 85 vehicles, and hopes to have more than 200 flexible-fuel vehicles in the next two years. Pantex installed this tank to help the plant comply with Executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease its petroleum use by 20% by 2005.  For a complete list of E85 locations, visit the >a href=""www.E85Fuel.com"">National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition Web site.     DOE Releases 25-Year Strategic Plan DOE released a 25-year plan that spells out a general vision and specific technologies and projects it hopes to develop. The plan is committed to clean coal and nuclear, but also supports renewable energy and energy efficiency. The specific goals related to renewables and efficiency include: Weatherize about 771,000 homes of low-income families (2003-2008). Reduce the cost of the hydrogen equivalent of a gallon of gas to $1.50 (2010). Accomplish FreedomCAR technical milestones (2010).  Develop and demonstrate technologies that can reduce emissions of more than 70 tonnes of carbon and equivalent greenhouse gases (2012). Evaluate policy instruments that foster the delivery of commercial quantities of hydrogen (2015). Develop technologies that allow industry to commercialize fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure (2015). Have renewable energy sources (excluding hydropower) reach 12 quadrillion Btu, nearly double the current production (2025). Develop and demonstrate technologies that generate heat and power with 90% efficiency (2025). Have solid-state lighting reduce energy demand for lighting by one-fifth compared to that of 2000 (2025).  To read the entire plan, visit the  DOE Web site .     First Tennessee Public E85 Facility Opens The first public E85 facility in Tennessee opened recently in Nashville.  Citgo's new 10,000-gallon E85 tank will service about 1,200 fleet vehicles as well as the public.  Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee worked with Hollingsworth Oil and received a grant from the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to partially fund the project.     For more information about E85, to find a complete list of E85 fueling locations, or to see if your vehicle can be powered by this fuel, visit the  National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition Web site .     City of Brownsville Purchases Three Propane Buses The City of Brownsville, Texas, recently ordered three, 30-foot propane transit coaches from National Bus Sales of Chino, California. Each bus costs approximately $265,000, and delivery is expected in February 2004. The funding came from a Federal Transit Administration grant administered by the Texas Department of Transportation. The City plans to replace 2-3 buses per year if funding is available. Contact:  Tom Logan  at 956 541 5281.     New Haven Opens First CNG Station Government officials in New Haven, Connecticut, celebrated the grandopening of the first CNG fueling station in the city. The officials plan to establish a government fleet fueled by CNG, following in the footsteps of other Connecticut localities that already operate CNG vehicles.     City of Berkeley Fleet Goes Biodiesel The City of Berkeley celebrated a milestone by becoming the first city of its size in the United States to transition to 100% biodiesel in its diesel vehicles. The city held an exhibit and ceremony to celebrate the occasion that featured a variety of diesel vehicles from the departments of Public Works, Parks, Fire, Police, and Health and Human Services.       Biodiesel works in any diesel engine with few or no modifications. Among its advantages, according to EPA, are considerably reducing the emissions produced by petroleum-based diesel. It is safer to transport, store, and use, because it is not a hazardous material like petroleum products. Biodiesel also reduces dependence on foreign oil.       Regional Transportation Center Opens in San Diego The Regional Transportation Center (RTC), the world's first, most advanced and most  comprehensive showcase of alternative fuels and alternative fuel the vehicles, has opened in San Diego.

GM, BMW to Develop Hydrogen Fueling Technology GM and the BMW Group will work together to develop fueling technology for liquid hydrogen vehicles and will invite other automakers and suppliers to join them. GM said BMW is an ideal partner because the German automaker has done extensive research on liquid hydrogen.  Every major automaker is working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, most with fuel cells. GM and BMW say their goal is to have affordable and compelling hydrogen vehicles for sale by 2010. A key to meeting that goal is developing ways to store and handle the fuel easily.  Compressed and liquid hydrogen both hold promise for hydrogen-powered vehicles, but liquid hydrogen's density is especially attractive with respect to fuel distribution. The collaborative work will center around setting global standards for fueling equipment, both on vehicles and at retail locations, and establishing specifications for suppliers.      Fuel Cell Vehicles to Number 800,000 by 2012 The number of FCVs that will be introduced to the world in the coming decade will reach 800,000 by 2012, according to a new study by Allied Business Intelligence. FCVs will contribute critical knowledge for early rollouts in niche markets in the second half of this decade, according to the study. ABI believes that greater attention is finally being given to fuel cells, and there is as much awareness in the European Union as there is in Japan. The United States will have to more aggressively execute its strategy of solving technological challenges and infrastructure layouts if it is to help early FCV introduction by the second half of the decade.  ABI has updated its forecasts for FCV shipments and its analysis of the changing global fuel cell business environment. The study exposes regional characteristics of the automotive fuel cell sector and outlines a timeline for potential fuel cell penetration in the next 10 years.     Abraham Calls for International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy At the International Energy Agency Ministerial meeting, DOE Secretary Abraham called for an international collaboration in advanced R&D that will support the deployment of hydrogen energy technologies. A growing number of countries have committed to accelerate the development of hydrogen energy technologies to improve their energy, economic, and environmental security. The United States has committed $1.7 billion for the first five years of a long-term R&D program for hydrogen, hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cells, and hybrid vehicle technologies. The European Union has committed up to 2 billion Euros to long-term R&D of renewable and hydrogen energy technologies.

The coalition aims for a 17% annual increase in the number of vehicles powered by alternative fuels on Middle Georgia roads. The plan was officially endorsed by DOE, opening new funding sources for governments and businesses interested in buying electric buses, biodiesel-powered trucks, or propane-fueled forklifts. The plan, created to improve the region's air quality and increase national energy security, includes providing electric shuttle buses between attractions and parking in downtown Macon, and adding propane-powered buses to meet every flight at Middle Georgia Regional Airport. Macon has exceeded federal ozone standards for the past four summers, and the American Lung Association last year named it the 24th most polluted city in the country. The EPA has designated in a nonattainment area. Although nonattainment designation is generally undesirable, it will increase federal funding for the purchase of more clean vehicles.     United States Settles Clean Air Act Case Against Toyota DOJ and EPA finalized a settlement of a government lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corporation for Clean Air Act violations involving 2.2 million vehicles manufactured between 1996 and 1998. Under the settlement, Toyota will spend $20 million on a supplemental environmental project to retrofit as many as 3,000 high polluting public diesel vehicles (including school buses and municipal fleets) with pollution control equipment. Toyota will also accelerate its compliance with certain new emission control requirements and pay a $500,000 civil penalty. The settlement will cost Toyota an estimated $34 million. Labor and subcontractor costs may not be credited against the $20 million spending requirement.  Parts and equipment provided by entities in which Toyota has a financial interest may be credited against the $20 million spending requirement, provided that such parts and equipment are valued at their actual cost.  Toyota has 180 days to complete and submit a plan to EPA, and then has 5 years to complete the project.

Contact:  Alexander Masetti , APCI, 610-481-7461.     Missouri Army Base Dedicates E85 Tank Ft. Leonard Wood Army Base in central Missouri dedicated its E85 and B20 tank on March 4, 2003.  This installation marks the first Army base to carry two types of alternative fuels. The 10,000 gallon E85 tank will fuel the 42 E85 FFVs at the base.  This number is expected to grow by 75-80 in the next few months.  The project was initiated in 2001 to comply with executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease petroleum use by 20% by 2005.    Ethanol production in Missouri currently exceeds 45 million gallons per year, and a number of other plants are being considered. The NEVC will help the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy establish E85 fueling sites at other military bases in 2003.     DOE Says Private and Local AFV Mandates Not Necessary DOE issued a Notice of Public Rulemaking  (PDF 204  KB)  announcing that private fleet and local government fleet mandates are not necessary and therefore should not be imposed under EPAct. According to the rule, additional fleet mandates would not significantly reduce American dependence on fossil fuels.  DOE said that even if it did impose acquisition requirements, market conditions could result in their eventual suspension because there is little alternative fuel infrastructure, suitable AFVs are not available, and some alternative fuels cost more than conventional motor fuels.    The decision will apply to business fleets and local government fleets, and will eliminate potential mandates for law enforcement fleets and transit buses. However, mandates already in place for state governments and fuel provider fleets remain in force. There is a 90-day period for interested parties to submit written comments on this determination. DOE will issue its final determination in late summer or fall.     GM and NEVC Advance the Use of E85 General Motors Corporation  announced a multimillion dollar campaign to promote the use of corn-based ethanol fuel E85 as an alternative to gasoline. Today, ethanol made from corn reduces the demand for imported oil by 98,000 barrels per day, representing a $1.1 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit. In the future, ethanol may be produced from biomass feedstocks. There are currently more than 3 million E85 vehicles on American roads. The public awareness effort is a 2-year partnership with the nonprofit  National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition  focused on increasing ethanol use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs), which are designed to use either ethanol or gasoline; E85 FFVs can be powered by gasoline or a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.   The ethanol promotion effort will begin in Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois. The campaign will include a variety of tactics, including information made available to customers at dealerships, direct mail, advertising, and on-line activities.     Tour De Sol: The Great American Green Transportation Festival The  Tour De Sol  culminates in May in a series of festivals and a road-rally competition in the Northeast.

The bill transfers the responsibility for regulating electric bicycles from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This means they are not subject to many of the same standards as motor vehicles, but will be regulated as bicycles. These human-electric hybrid bicycles are operated by human pedaling and electric batteries. They achieve the equivalent of 1000 mpg.   February  2003     SEP Special Projects Solicitation The State Energy Program Special Projects Solicitation was announced February 14, 2003. Financial assistance will be available to the states for special project activities. States may apply to undertake any project.

Fleet Uses New Funding Program for AFVs Fetzer Vineyards in Hopland, California, is using a new Ford credit program called GreenLease that offers lower payments than financing or purchasing an AFV, and requires no down payments. Fetzer acquired three Ford Ranger EVs on a three-year lease, and has ordered another.  Initially, GreenLease was available only as a net lease; however, a TRAC (open-end) lease is now available. A net lease permits fleets to return the AFV at lease end without further obligation (except for excess wear and tear and excess mileage); under a TRAC lease, the customer assumes the responsibility for the residual value of the vehicle at lease end. Compressed natural gas, electric, ethanol, and propane vehicles are eligible for a GreenLease.  For more information, contact a Ford Credit Commercial Lending branch at 1-877-234-FMCC (3622) or visit the   Ford Web site .     World's First Biodiesel Rental Car Debuts on Maui Maui Recycling Service announced the debut of the   Bio-Beetle rental car , the world's first biodiesel powered car rental. The Bio-Beetle is an unmodified 2000 Volkswagen Beetle diesel (TDI), which is powered by 100% biodiesel. Maui Recycling Service has contracted with Maui Car Rentals to manage the rental.  The Bio-Beetle gives the public the opportunity to drive a renewably fueled car and offers them firsthand experience that renewable fuels are available and that they work.  Bio-Beetle will purchase all its fuel from Pacific Biodiesel, who makes all its fuel from used cooking oil.   January   2003     Bush Announces Hydrogen Initiative President Bush announced a $1.2 billion  hydrogen initiative  during his State of the Union address. The initiative will include $720 million in new funding over the next five years to develop the technologies and infrastructure needed to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles and to generate electricity.  The initiative complements the President's FreedomCAR initiative, which is developing technologies needed to mass produce safe and affordable hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Through partnerships with industry, these two initiatives seek to make these vehicles cost effective for large numbers of Americans by 2020.                  The new hydrogen initiative and FreedomCAR will dramatically improve America's energy security by significantly reducing the need for imported oil, and are key components of the President's clean air and climate change strategies.  For more information about hydrogen technologies, see the   National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap .     WMPI Awarded DOE Grant to Develop Diesel Fuel The DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative grant program has approved a $100-million grant to Gilberton, Pennsylvania-based Waste Management and Processors, Inc. to develop a new program for converting coal sludge to diesel fuel with the Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid technology. The plant will be the first to commercialize this process and is expected to produce approximately 60 million gallons per day of domestic transportation fuel.     Ethanol Workshop to be Held in California The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the Nebraska Ethanol Board, and the Clean Fuels Development Coalition are cosponsoring a workshop titled, Ethanol in California: Opportunities for Increased Utilization and Production, on February 6, 2003 at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. The workshop will provide information on the possibilities for ethanol production in California. The workshop will focus on the various forms of ethanol available to Californians that can have a positive impact on air quality and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several other workshops are planned within the next two years at various locations. Register for this event at the  Clean Fuels Development Coalition  Web site or the  American Coalition for Ethanol  site.     Ford Agrees to Sell Think Nordic to Kamkorp Microelectronics Ford Motor Company signed a letter of intent in late December to sell Think Nordic, the Norwegian part of its EV business, to Kamkorp Microelectronics of Switzerland. The agreement will save 100 jobs at the Think Nordic plant in Aurskog, Norway. Ford announced in late August 2002 that it was abandoning its TH!NK brand of battery-powered EVs, focusing instead on developing hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. As part of the agreement, Kamkorp will also acquire the rights to the TH!NK and city brand names developed by Ford. Ford acquired the Norwegian plant in 1999, when it was operating under the PIVCO name.     Nissan Unveils UTC Fuel Cells A Nissan X-TRAIL FCV fuel cell vehicle powered by a UTC Fuel Cells (UTCFC) hydrogen power plant was the first produced under agreements signed between Nissan and UTCFC to develop fuel cells and fuel cell components for vehicles.  The zero-emission X-TRAIL FCV, a hybrid vehicle that draws its primary power from a 75-kW UTCFC ambient pressure fuel cell power plant, is fueled by compressed hydrogen. Nissan intends to start public road testing of the vehicle in Japan.  UTCFC is also developing fuel cells for the fleet vehicle market with partners Irisbus of Europe and Thor Industries of the United States. A Thor Industries' bus powered by a 75-kW fuel cell power plant unit entered passenger service in November with Sunline Transit Agency.     General Motors to Offer Hybrid Vehicles GM will offer hybrid options on several vehicles, starting later this year with the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups for use in commercial fleets. The hybrid versions of the trucks will increase fuel economy by 10% to 12%. The vehicles will be publicly available in 2004.  Depending on demand, GM may produce a million or more a year by 2007. In 2005, GM will begin producing a hybrid Saturn VUE sport utility. It will also include a hybrid option on its Chevy Equinox SUV in 2006 and its Chevy Malibu sedan in 2007. Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also plan hybrid models.  Buyers in some areas qualify for a federal tax deduction and local tax breaks. Even though a hybrid could cost $4,000 more than a conventional vehicle, an owner could save nearly $5,500 in gasoline expenses over the vehicle's driving life.   September 0004     PERC Offers Forklift Maintenance and Training Program The Propane Education & Research Council (PERC), in partnership with the Propane Vehicle Council (PVC) offers a pilot Forklift Technician Maintenance and Training Program for companies that operate Class 4 and 5 large spark ignition propane-fueled forklifts.

This means taxpayers who purchase a new hybrid vehicle may claim a tax deduction of as much as $2,000 on Form 1040 if the vehicle is placed in service on or before December 31, 2003. The maximum deduction will be reduced by 25% for vehicles placed into service in 2004, by 50% in 2005, and by 75% in 2006. No deduction will be allowed for vehicles placed in service after December 31, 2006. Federal tax law allows individuals to claim a deduction for the incremental cost of buying a motor vehicle that is propelled by a clean-burning fuel. By combining an electric motor with a gasoline-powered engine, the Prius has greater fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than similar vehicles powered solely by conventional gasoline-powered engines. Under the law, the one-time deduction must be taken in the year the vehicle was originally used. The taxpayer must be the original owner. Individuals take this benefit as an adjustment to income on their Form 1040. They do not have to itemize deductions on their tax returns to claim it.   For more information, see the Toyota certification of costs   (PDF 200 KB)  or the Internal Revenue Service acknowledgment of certification   (PDF 200 KB) .

DOE Releases Climate Change Reports DOE released two climate change reports that present a portfolio of federal R&D investments in climate change technology development, and highlight President Bush's initiatives along with other important developments related to climate change.  The reports, titled  Research and Current Activities     (PDF 3.8 MB)  and  Technology Options for the Near and Long Term   (PDF 13.35 MB) , discuss an integral part of the comprehensive U.S. strategy on climate change that rests on science, technology and international cooperation.  They also complement the recent Climate Change Science Program strategic plan, which represents an unprecedented effort to advance our knowledge of climate variability, the potential response of the climate system to growing greenhouse gas concentrations and their implications, and management options for natural environments.   December  2003     Cornell Awarded $2.25 Million to Find New Materials for Fuel Cells The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded Cornell University $2.25 million over three years to establish the Cornell Fuel Cell Institute (CFCI), which will conduct research to find new materials for fuel cells. The DOE funds will primarily support graduate and postdoctoral research.  During the past 20 years, little materials research has aimed at improving fuel cells. Most of the limits that current fuel cells face are in the materials. The goal at Cornell is to make the materials effective and cheap.  CFCI researchers found that a compound of platinum and bismuth is an ideal fuel cell material. It is not an alloy like stainless steel or the platinum-ruthenium that many fuel cells use, but a so-called ordered intermetallic compound in which atoms are very specifically arranged. Others have found several other promising compounds, and will search through thousands of intermetallic compounds to find compositions and structures that are even more attractive as fuel cell electrodes.    November  2003     NETL Publishes Fuel Cell Fact Sheet  The National Energy Technology Laboratory has published a fact sheet titled,   DOE's Fuel Cell Research Targets National Goals for Energy and the Environment , which details its fuel cell research and how that research correlates to three federal initiatives for energy and the environment: (1) Clear Skies Initiative, a comprehensive policy to reduce sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions from the power generation sector; (2) Climate Change Initiative, which has the goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce GHG intensity 18% by 2012; and (3) Energy Security, which seeks to diversify energy resources, develop new technologies for distributed power, promote conservation, use domestic energy resources, and modernize energy delivery systems.     Workshop Tackles Biological Hydrogen Production  The results of a two-day workshop on  hydrogen production through biological and artificial systems  are now available. The workshop was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and hosted jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory.      The primary objective of the workshop was to define the future roles of biotechnology, biomimetic chemistry, and artificial photosynthesis in the development of innovative hydrogen production technologies.      Research into the sustainable production of hydrogen is crucial to the nation's future as the country moves toward energy independence. A better understanding of the organisms and biological processes that produce hydrogen naturally could lead to sustainable methods of producing hydrogen from sunlight and water. These might include totally artificial processes that mimic biology.      The workshop participants also identified important scientific challenges and a set of short- and long-term goals for research relating to hydrogen production.      Fossil Energy Web Site Highlights Hydrogen The U.S. Department of Energy's  Fossil Energy Web site  now has a section titled, Hydrogen and Other Clean Fuels. Readers can access information about President Bush's Hydrogen Initiative; technologies for producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, natural gas, and coal; and methods for delivering hydrogen. It discusses current technologies such as steam reforming of natural gas, as well as emerging hydrogen production technologies.     Propane School Bus Unveiled  The first dedicated propane school bus was unveiled at the Annual Conference and Trade Show of the National Association for Pupil Transportation. Built by Corbeil Bus, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis. It was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, with support from ProCon (a consortium of propane providers and equipment manufacturers), the Propane Vehicle Council, and the Propane Education & Research Council.    The school bus is a technology enhanced aftermarket model that features an 8.1-liter gasoline engine, now engineered to a dedicated propane system. It features a GMT 233 WB chassis, a cutaway chassis with a truck front end. The bus can be equipped to meet the needs of physically challenged students and is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.     The frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank manifold with a total usable capacity of more than 50 gallons of propane fuel. The manifold enables better packaging and delivery of propane fuel and is positioned between the frame rails to provide a robust and secure environment for durability and safety. The vehicle will be certified for all state, EPA, and CARB ULEV emission standards.     School districts in Texas, Oregon, and California have indicated their desire to order the new propane school bus. ProCon will accept orders from customers immediately.  Delivery is expected around May 2004.     First Clean-Fueled Snow Plow Truck Arrives on Long Island The New York State Department of Transportation retrofitted nine vehicles, including four snowplows and five medium-duty dump trucks, with clean-burning engines fueled by a 80% compressed natural gas and 20% diesel fuel. The first snowplow, unveiled at the seventh annual Alternative Fuel Vehicle Conference sponsored by the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition, has arrived on Long Island. The other snowplows, as well as five medium-duty dump trucks, are expected to be completed and delivered to the Long Island region by late spring 2004.  The trucks are being retrofitted under a $500,000 grant secured by NYSERDA, at a cost of approximately $28,000 per vehicle. They are being tested in Suffolk County, where they will help meet clean air goals.  During a seven-year period, each truck is expected to emit 3,000 pounds less nitrogen oxides and 90 pounds less particulate matter, reductions of 40% and 95%, respectively, and to reduce diesel fuel use by about 5,140 gallons per year.      Dedicated Propane Low-Floor Bus Chassis Unveiled The propane industry unveiled the first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis at BusCon 2003.  Built by Heart International, with funding from the Propane Education & Research Council and the U.S. Department of Energy, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis with an 8.1 liter engine, engineered now to run on a dedicated propane system.  The Propane Promotion Consortium and the Propane Vehicle Council provided additional support to the project. The low-floor bus uses the Heart International kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the bus doors open.  With this technology and its completely flat, step-less interior, the bus complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and provides easy navigation for persons with strollers. Two body frame versionsone for park services and another for mass transit and airport shuttle serviceswill be offered.      Metro Denver Opens First Retail Biodiesel Fueling Station Trucking fleets, school districts, and diesel vehicle owners in the metro Denver area will soon have a convenient local source of biodiesel.  Blue Sun Biodiesel and Shoco Oil, Inc., announced the grand opening of Denver's first retail biodiesel fueling station in Commerce City. Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing biodiesel energy crops and infrastructure in cooperation with regional farmers, and implementing state-of-the art production and distribution facilities.  The Shoco Oil Commerce City facility is a 12-acre commercial fueling center that provides gasoline, on and off road diesel fuel, and quality lubricants.  Shoco currently services agricultural, construction, mining, school districts, and government fleets statewide.   Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing regional farmer cooperatives to produce biodiesel feedstock from crops adapted to arid high plains growing conditions. There are 5.6 million acres of dryland winter wheat in the region, and oilseed crops added to the rotation could bring farmers an additional $280 million in revenues per year.  As a domestic source of energy that reduces harmful emissions and greenhouse gases, biodiesel will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our health and environment.     Low-Floor Bus Chassis Ready for Ordering The first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis was built by Heart International, with funding from PERC and DOE, and additional support from ProCon and the Propane Vehicle Council. The width of the frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank module with a total usable capacity of 65 gallons of propane fuel. It is an environmentally friendly low-floor bus that effectively caters to the needs of mass transit, parks, and airport shuttle services.  The low-floor bus uses kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the doors open, while still employing rear-wheel-drive reliability. The frame is lowered 14 inches. Modified front leaf springs and auxiliary air springs lower the cab two inches and provide standard front kneeling, in addition to improved steering control. Independent rear suspension, which uses a twist channel beam suspension, provides greater flexibility than a solid rear axle. Rear air springs provide optional kneeling in any direction when combined with the standard auxiliary front air springs.  A completely flat, step-less interior allows the bus to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Access for persons in wheelchairs and with strollers is at the same entry point as for all other passengers.    October   2003     Trolleys to Roll in Downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana The Capitol Park Trolley, a new natural gas trolley system for the downtown Baton Rouge area, will provide efficient transportation for visitors and for those working in the area. It will also be an incentive to patronize downtown businesses, thus helping revitalize downtown. The trolley, the first mass transit program in Louisiana to operate on natural gas, will run Monday through Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and will be free.  Initially, the route will run from the Sheraton, north down River Road, up to Third Street to the north end of Capitol Park, south down Fourth Street and back around to the Sheraton.  There are approximately 15 convenient stops on the route and the waiting period to catch a trolley is estimated to be six minutes.  Funding for the project was identified in May 2003 through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds.  The Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with Plan Baton Rouge, the Downtown Development District, and Capital Transportation Corporation, worked to secure approvals for funding from the Mayor's Office, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, and the Federal Transit Authority.  The cost of the three-year project is approximately $1.6 million for infrastructure, operation and maintenance costs: $1.3 million in federal CMAQ funds and $300,000 in state matching funds. The State and the Capital Transportation Corporation have entered into a cooperative endeavor agreement to operate the service for three years with the option to expand service when deemed necessary and additional funding becomes available.       Kansas-Grown Fuel Available at the Pump The first fueling station in Wichita to offer E85 has opened at The new Kwik Shop. The number of ethanol-producing plants in Kansas has increased, but the state has been slower than others in the Midwest to make ethanol blends available. Kansas has five operating ethanol plants: Abengoa, U.S. Energy Partners at Russell, MGP at Atchison, Reeves AgriEnergy at Garden City, and ESE at Leoti. All but MGP use either corn or grain sorghum as feedstock.  MGP uses wheat to produce gluten, fuel ethanol, and beverage alcohol. A dozen more plants are in the works or under consideration. The legislature has provided new incentives for ethanol use and state cars now burn ethanol blends.  In addition, new cars purchased for the state fleet will be capable of burning E85.     Monsanto, GM, and NEVC Partner for E85 Infrastructure The Monsanto Company recently announced a multi-million dollar, two-year partnership among General Motors and the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to establish new E85 fueling locations and to deliver improved corn for the dry mill ethanol industry.    As a part of this initative, Monsanto is launching a new program titled Fuel Your Profits, a processor preferred high fermentable corn solutions package offered to dry mill ethanol plants and corn growers.  Growers can participate by selecting an enrolled dry mill ethanol plant, then committing to plant and deliver the grain over the next two years.  Producers will then be eligible to receive discounts on GM flexible-fuel vehicles and an E85 fueling location.   GM has more than one million vehicles on the road that can burn E85, and has increased ethanol demand through its E85 awareness efforts with NEVC. The NEVC is committed to advancing ethanol, E85 use, and the ethanol infrastructure.  This program with Monsanto and GM will increase availability of E85 fueling sites and increase demand for E85 as farmers acquire GM flexible-fuel vehicles.      USDA Provides Biodiesel Fuel Education Program Grants The National Biodiesel Board and the University of Idaho will receive $960,000 from the USDA to conduct a biodiesel fuel education program. The National Biodiesel Board was awarded $770,000 to create educational programming and the University of Idaho was awarded $190,000 to provide technical support for the effort. The purpose of the grants, which were competitively awarded, is to develop an educational program to target governmental and private entities that operate vehicle fleets. The program will address issues previously identified by fleet operators and other potential fuel users, including the need to balance the positive environmental, social, and human health effects of biodiesel consumption with the increased cost per gallon. These grants will also be used to inform other interested groups and the public about biodiesel use.      Knoxville Adds Propane Hybrid Trolleys to AFV Fleet The  East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition (ETCFC)  recently announced that Knoxville Area Transit (KAT) will soon debut four propane-powered hybrid electric trolleys to serve downtown Knoxville as part of KAT's Clean Fuels Program.            KAT currently operates five dedicated propane vans that serve the University of Tennessee, and aims to operate almost completely on alternative fuels within the next five years. KAT's plans call for vans, trolleys, and possibly some buses to run on propane, and for some buses to operate on B20.        The first hybrid electric trolley is scheduled to begin operating in October; the remainder are set to begin service in December.     GEM Donates 75 Vehicles to City of Boston and 2004 Democratic Convention Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, donated 75 vehicles to the City of Boston and the 2004 Democratic convention. The donation completes a program in which more than 2,000 GEM vehicles have been provided to municipalities and charitable and service organizations.  GEMs are classified by the federal government as low speed vehicles, and have a top speed of 25 mph. They are alternatives to full-size automobiles for short trips, and are primary people movers on corporate, academic, and military campuses.  GEMs went into production four years ago, and now more than 26,000 are on roads with 35 mph or lower speed limits across the country.      1st Annual University Student Hydrogen Design Contest To help develop the hydrogen economy and engage students in the progression of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, the National Hydrogen Association and the U.S. Department of Energy are looking for innovative and imaginative designs for a next-generation hydrogen fueling station.  Teams of graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in North American colleges and universities for the 2003-2004 academic year are invited to participate in the    1st Annual University Student Hydrogen Design Contest . It requires creativity and knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including design/architecture, engineering, economics, environmental and physical sciences, business, and others.

Selections are expected to include one winning team and four honorable mention teams. The winning team will receive an all expense paid trip to Hollywood, California, to present its winning design at a plenary session of the 2004 NHA Annual Conference. The four honorable mention teams will be invited to give poster presentations of their work and will receive free conference registration and materials. All five teams will receive awards at a ceremony preceding the presentation of the winning entry.    September 2003     Lansing, Michigan, Joins DOE's Clean Cities Program DOE designated the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition as the newest member of its Clean Cities Program on September 26. Earning such a designation from the program is not a simple task: The Lansing group has been working for seven years to advance the use of alternative fuels in the area. After the City of Lansing partnered with St. Johns and other area communities and groups, DOE helped the coalition to build a market foundation for alternative fuel vehicles, form its own group of stakeholders, hold meetings, identify a coordinator, define goals, and develop an action plan to achieve those goals. The Clean Cities designation recognizes the coalition as working to strengthen the nation's energy security, improve air quality and stimulate the local economy by creating new alternative fuel markets. See the  September 26 press release  on the DOE Web site.     Green Cars Start Their Engines Numerous automakers, as well as a few tinkerers, showcased 100 environmentally friendly cars and trucks at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. The vehicles, including plug-in electrics, hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and diesels, were put through testing for this eco-vehicle gathering. Japanese automakers are focusing on hybrids, and American manufacturers are promoting vehicles that would replace the internal combustion engine with fuel cells. European carmakers are focusing on diesel engines.         The vehicles were tested on drive by noise, fuel efficiency, exhaust emissions, acceleration, braking, slalom driving, and fuel efficiency. The friendly competition included an individual who spent $5,000 to convert a pickup truck to run on hydrogen, natural gas, propane, and gasoline, as well as any combination. Test drives of futuristic fuel cell prototypes were also offered.      Innovative Transit Bus Focuses on the Future The   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  is collaborating with other government agencies and the automotive industry to develop a bus that is designed to capture the nostalgia and appeal of the buses driven in Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s. The new yellow bus carries 16 to 32 passengers, can use an alternative fuel, features a low floor, and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.    The bus is built on a General Motors T-560 medium-duty chassis with a gross vehicle weight of 19,000-26,000 pounds. It took three years to design and build. Instead of conventional shocks, the bus rides on compressed air, which is released to lower the bus for boarding. It is designed to run on natural gas. Eventually, similar buses will be manufactured using several optional engines, to allow use of alternative fuels like natural gas, propane, ethanol, and biodiesel. Its purposes are to protect the national park's pristine environment and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.      Biodiesel Carries New Weight Premium The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) has passed a new definition for premium diesel, and the changes are good news for biodiesel. Lubricity is now is considered in determining whether a fuel can be classified as a premium diesel fuel. Independent tests show just 1% biodiesel can increase the lubricity of petroleum diesel by as much as 65%.  The NCWM list now includes cetane, cold flow properties, thermal stability, and lubricity. This important development makes the positive lubricity benefit of biodiesel a premium attribute. The changes will appear in the 2004 NIST Handbook 130.   August    2003     Pump Lets Natural Gas Civics Go to Market In 2004 Honda will begin mass-marketing natural gas-powered Civics that will come with a device to fill the tank in a garage. This is the first time an automaker will sell a natural gas vehicle broadly to the public. Until now, sales have been mostly limited to specialized fleets such as airport vans and university campus vehicles. Since 1998, Honda has sold 500 to 1,000 natural gas Civic GX models per year to customers such as the New York Department of Transportation. They are popular for commercial fleets that travel short distances and have their own filling stations. The drawback to widespread sales has been the lack of an easy, reliable way to fuel the vehicles. Honda will sell an appliance, called Phill, with each Civic GX to fill the tank from a home gas line. Phill will cost $2,000, but tax credits may knock the end cost down to $1,000. The Civic GX will cost about $20,000. Honda views the market as mostly second and commuter cars.   Phill, made by Toronto-based Fuelmaker, requires 8 hours to half-fill a vehicle, good for 100 miles. GX owners also can refill at approximately 1,300 natural gas stations nationwide. Filling stations that dispense compressed natural gas under pressure can fill a tank in three to five minutes.Running a vehicle on natural gas historically costs about 80% of what it costs to run on gasoline.  Honda views natural gas as a critical bridge to acceptance of hydrogen-powered vehicles it expects to sell in large numbers by 2015. By putting Phills in garages, Honda hopes people will accept the idea of hydrogen fuel cell generators in their garages later. Compared with gasoline, natural gas emits 70% less carbon monoxide, 87% less nitrogen oxide, and 20% less carbon dioxide.      New E85 Tank in Amarillo, Texas The second E85 station in Texas will soon be pumping E85. The new 10,000-gallon E85 tank is located near Amarillo, Texas, and also offers biodiesel and unleaded gasoline for its 300-vehicle fleet.  BWXT Pantex, which manages and operates the Pantex nuclear weapons facility for the National Nuclear Security Administration, will initially use E85 in about 85 vehicles, and hopes to have more than 200 flexible-fuel vehicles in the next two years. Pantex installed this tank to help the plant comply with Executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease its petroleum use by 20% by 2005.  For a complete list of E85 locations, visit the >a href=""www.E85Fuel.com"">National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition Web site.     DOE Releases 25-Year Strategic Plan DOE released a 25-year plan that spells out a general vision and specific technologies and projects it hopes to develop. The plan is committed to clean coal and nuclear, but also supports renewable energy and energy efficiency.

City of Brownsville Purchases Three Propane Buses The City of Brownsville, Texas, recently ordered three, 30-foot propane transit coaches from National Bus Sales of Chino, California. Each bus costs approximately $265,000, and delivery is expected in February 2004. The funding came from a Federal Transit Administration grant administered by the Texas Department of Transportation. The City plans to replace 2-3 buses per year if funding is available. Contact:  Tom Logan  at 956 541 5281.     City of Berkeley Fleet Goes Biodiesel The City of Berkeley celebrated a milestone by becoming the first city of its size in the United States to transition to 100% biodiesel in its diesel vehicles. The city held an exhibit and ceremony to celebrate the occasion that featured a variety of diesel vehicles from the departments of Public Works, Parks, Fire, Police, and Health and Human Services.       Biodiesel works in any diesel engine with few or no modifications. Among its advantages, according to EPA, are considerably reducing the emissions produced by petroleum-based diesel. It is safer to transport, store, and use, because it is not a hazardous material like petroleum products. Biodiesel also reduces dependence on foreign oil.

The facility received a $300,250 grant from the Propane Education & Research Council, $200,000 from City of Austin Fleet Services, and $600,000 from the Aviation Department.   The new facility will save time and money for fleet operators such as AMPCO System Parking, which currently operates 29 propane-powered shuttle buses at the airport. Catering vehicles, forklifts, shuttles, sit down rider trucks, and taxis that might operate on the airport will also no longer have to travel off-site to fuel.  The station will also facilitate the conversion of private sector fleets of ground transportation companies located near the airport. As part of the conversion effort, the program will provide for rebates to convert these fleets to propane.      PERC Announces Pilot Forklift Maintenance and Repair Training Program The Propane Education & Research Council (PERC), in partnership with the Propane Vehicle Council, announced a new pilot program for training employees at companies operating Class 4 and 5 large spark ignition propane-fueled forklifts.  The program is designed to train attendees in the proper procedures for maintaining and repairing propane-powered forklift fuel systems, with an emphasis on pre-2002 open-loop models. The curriculum includes instruction in safety, maintenance, and monitoring of a fuel system, tailpipe emissions, and an introduction to U.S. EPA and California Air Resources Board emissions regulations for propane-fueled forklifts.  The PERC-funded training program will begin in California, Illinois, and Texas. Students who complete the course will be able to:  Identify the health signs of air contamination.  Evaluate the fuel systems and choose tanks, lines, hoses, valves, and fittings. Understand proper filling procedures. Perform systematic diagnostic and troubleshooting procedures.   Perform scheduled maintenance and component repairs. Differentiate between ambient air and tailpipe emissions. Determine compliance for various emission standards.       Colorado Corn Growers Association Receives NEVC Funding The Colorado Corn Growers Association recently received $50,000 from the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to advance the use of E85. The money will be used for new E85 infrastructure, promotion, and education of car retailers and dealers.    About 80 new pumps will be installed over the next 12 to 18 months along the front range of Colorado, which currently has 9 E85 public fueling stations.  General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler have manufactured almost 3 million E85 vehicles on the road today, and the money from NEVC will help kick off an aggressive and creative campaign to convert 10,000 Denver area drivers to ethanol permanently.      Whitman Announces $5 Million for Clean School Bus Program EPA Administrator Christie Whitman announced the availability of a $5 million grant program to make school buses cleaner for the 24 million children who travel on buses to and from school every day. The grants are under EPA's Clean School Bus USA initiative which is designed to limit children's exposure to the harmful effects of diesel exhaust from school buses.  There are roughly 440,000 school buses in the country. EPA is offering as many as 20 grants to help school districts across the country upgrade their school bus fleets, either by replacing older buses with new, cleaner ones or by retrofitting older buses with pollution control devices.  The application deadline for the EPA grants is Friday, August 1, 2003.

Six High Schools Win Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge Six high school teams were winners today of the first Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge, part of the DOE National Science Bowl. The teams of four students in each race received $1,000 for their science departments. Ten of the 66 National Science Bowl high school teams competed in the Model Car Challenge by designing, building, testing, and racing hydrogen fuel cell model cars. The cars were no larger than one foot wide and two feet long.  The cars used electricity from small solar panels to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen. The teams then stored the hydrogen on the car and used it to run a fuel cell that generated electricity to power a motor. Since no combustion was involved, the only by-products were heat and water. Engineers from DOE, and GM provided technical advice. GM provided the model car components.   Visit the  Office of Science Web site  for information on the teams and on the National Science Bowl.

GM, BMW to Develop Hydrogen Fueling Technology GM and the BMW Group will work together to develop fueling technology for liquid hydrogen vehicles and will invite other automakers and suppliers to join them. GM said BMW is an ideal partner because the German automaker has done extensive research on liquid hydrogen.  Every major automaker is working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, most with fuel cells. GM and BMW say their goal is to have affordable and compelling hydrogen vehicles for sale by 2010. A key to meeting that goal is developing ways to store and handle the fuel easily.  Compressed and liquid hydrogen both hold promise for hydrogen-powered vehicles, but liquid hydrogen's density is especially attractive with respect to fuel distribution. The collaborative work will center around setting global standards for fueling equipment, both on vehicles and at retail locations, and establishing specifications for suppliers.      Fuel Cell Vehicles to Number 800,000 by 2012 The number of FCVs that will be introduced to the world in the coming decade will reach 800,000 by 2012, according to a new study by Allied Business Intelligence. FCVs will contribute critical knowledge for early rollouts in niche markets in the second half of this decade, according to the study. ABI believes that greater attention is finally being given to fuel cells, and there is as much awareness in the European Union as there is in Japan. The United States will have to more aggressively execute its strategy of solving technological challenges and infrastructure layouts if it is to help early FCV introduction by the second half of the decade.  ABI has updated its forecasts for FCV shipments and its analysis of the changing global fuel cell business environment. The study exposes regional characteristics of the automotive fuel cell sector and outlines a timeline for potential fuel cell penetration in the next 10 years.     Abraham Calls for International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy At the International Energy Agency Ministerial meeting, DOE Secretary Abraham called for an international collaboration in advanced R&D that will support the deployment of hydrogen energy technologies. A growing number of countries have committed to accelerate the development of hydrogen energy technologies to improve their energy, economic, and environmental security. The United States has committed $1.7 billion for the first five years of a long-term R&D program for hydrogen, hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cells, and hybrid vehicle technologies. The European Union has committed up to 2 billion Euros to long-term R&D of renewable and hydrogen energy technologies.   April     2003     EPA Calls for Grant Proposals to Retrofit Diesel Vehicles  The EPA announced plans to offer 5 to 10 grants of $50,000 to $100,000 (totaling $500,000) to public and private school bus fleets, waste haulers, private trucking fleets, locomotives, construction fleets, and agricultural fleets that agree to retrofit diesel engines with improved or new  technologies that reduce diesel exhaust emissions. Technologies will be primarily targeted to reduce particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.       Applications for the grants must be submitted no later than May 22. Contact:  Cathy Milbourn , 202-564-7824.     United States Settles Clean Air Act Case Against Toyota DOJ and EPA finalized a settlement of a government lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corporation for Clean Air Act violations involving 2.2 million vehicles manufactured between 1996 and 1998. Under the settlement, Toyota will spend $20 million on a supplemental environmental project to retrofit as many as 3,000 high polluting public diesel vehicles (including school buses and municipal fleets) with pollution control equipment. Toyota will also accelerate its compliance with certain new emission control requirements and pay a $500,000 civil penalty. The settlement will cost Toyota an estimated $34 million. Labor and subcontractor costs may not be credited against the $20 million spending requirement.  Parts and equipment provided by entities in which Toyota has a financial interest may be credited against the $20 million spending requirement, provided that such parts and equipment are valued at their actual cost.  Toyota has 180 days to complete and submit a plan to EPA, and then has 5 years to complete the project.     Oklahoma's DRV Energy Wins EPA ULEV Certifications DRV Energy secured a 49-state EPA approval for three new kits for aftermarket conversions of GM engines to natural gas.

This installation marks the first Army base to carry two types of alternative fuels. The 10,000 gallon E85 tank will fuel the 42 E85 FFVs at the base.  This number is expected to grow by 75-80 in the next few months.  The project was initiated in 2001 to comply with executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease petroleum use by 20% by 2005.    Ethanol production in Missouri currently exceeds 45 million gallons per year, and a number of other plants are being considered. The NEVC will help the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy establish E85 fueling sites at other military bases in 2003.     DOE Says Private and Local AFV Mandates Not Necessary DOE issued a Notice of Public Rulemaking  (PDF 204  KB)  announcing that private fleet and local government fleet mandates are not necessary and therefore should not be imposed under EPAct. According to the rule, additional fleet mandates would not significantly reduce American dependence on fossil fuels.  DOE said that even if it did impose acquisition requirements, market conditions could result in their eventual suspension because there is little alternative fuel infrastructure, suitable AFVs are not available, and some alternative fuels cost more than conventional motor fuels.    The decision will apply to business fleets and local government fleets, and will eliminate potential mandates for law enforcement fleets and transit buses. However, mandates already in place for state governments and fuel provider fleets remain in force. There is a 90-day period for interested parties to submit written comments on this determination. DOE will issue its final determination in late summer or fall.     GM and NEVC Advance the Use of E85 General Motors Corporation  announced a multimillion dollar campaign to promote the use of corn-based ethanol fuel E85 as an alternative to gasoline. Today, ethanol made from corn reduces the demand for imported oil by 98,000 barrels per day, representing a $1.1 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit. In the future, ethanol may be produced from biomass feedstocks. There are currently more than 3 million E85 vehicles on American roads. The public awareness effort is a 2-year partnership with the nonprofit  National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition  focused on increasing ethanol use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs), which are designed to use either ethanol or gasoline; E85 FFVs can be powered by gasoline or a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.   The ethanol promotion effort will begin in Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois. The campaign will include a variety of tactics, including information made available to customers at dealerships, direct mail, advertising, and on-line activities.     Tour De Sol: The Great American Green Transportation Festival The  Tour De Sol  culminates in May in a series of festivals and a road-rally competition in the Northeast. It is a unique, award-winning, year-round public education campaign with state-of-the-art hybrid and fuel cell cars, buses, bikes, neighborhood vehicles, green electricity choices, renewable energy displays, and other displays of Earth-friendly products.

Some will likely use on-site natural gas reforming technology. BP will be the largest fuel supplier to the DaimlerChrysler project that will bring 30 fuel cell transit buses to 10 European cities over the next few years. By reforming natural gas on site, the stations will be able to avoid storing large quantities of hydrogen and will not need constant truck deliveries of the fuel. Technology is being developed to fuel a small fleet of light-duty passenger vehicles each day. Its success would allow relatively low-cost, moderately sized natural gas reformation units at service stations throughout the United States, and in countries with readily available supplies of natural gas. Most service stations in the United States already have access to natural gas pipelines.     Bush Administration Eases Regulations on Electric Bicycles President Bush signed HR 727 into law, which eases the regulatory requirements for electric bicycles with less than 1 hp and a maximum speed of 20 mph. The bill transfers the responsibility for regulating electric bicycles from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This means they are not subject to many of the same standards as motor vehicles, but will be regulated as bicycles. These human-electric hybrid bicycles are operated by human pedaling and electric batteries. They achieve the equivalent of 1000 mpg.   February  2003     SEP Special Projects Solicitation The State Energy Program Special Projects Solicitation was announced February 14, 2003. Financial assistance will be available to the states for special project activities. States may apply to undertake any project. Financial assistance will be awarded to the states separately for each special project. Clean Cities applications are due Monday May 8, 2003, 8:00 p.m. eastern time. For more information, see the  State Energy Program Special Projects Master Solicitation, DE-PS36-03GO93001-00 For information about Clean Cities applications, see the  Clean Cities Program Category DE-PS36-03GO93001-01     Fleet Uses New Funding Program for AFVs Fetzer Vineyards in Hopland, California, is using a new Ford credit program called GreenLease that offers lower payments than financing or purchasing an AFV, and requires no down payments. Fetzer acquired three Ford Ranger EVs on a three-year lease, and has ordered another.  Initially, GreenLease was available only as a net lease; however, a TRAC (open-end) lease is now available. A net lease permits fleets to return the AFV at lease end without further obligation (except for excess wear and tear and excess mileage); under a TRAC lease, the customer assumes the responsibility for the residual value of the vehicle at lease end. Compressed natural gas, electric, ethanol, and propane vehicles are eligible for a GreenLease.  For more information, contact a Ford Credit Commercial Lending branch at 1-877-234-FMCC (3622) or visit the   Ford Web site .     World's First Biodiesel Rental Car Debuts on Maui Maui Recycling Service announced the debut of the   Bio-Beetle rental car , the world's first biodiesel powered car rental. The Bio-Beetle is an unmodified 2000 Volkswagen Beetle diesel (TDI), which is powered by 100% biodiesel. Maui Recycling Service has contracted with Maui Car Rentals to manage the rental.  The Bio-Beetle gives the public the opportunity to drive a renewably fueled car and offers them firsthand experience that renewable fuels are available and that they work.  Bio-Beetle will purchase all its fuel from Pacific Biodiesel, who makes all its fuel from used cooking oil.   January   2003     Bush Announces Hydrogen Initiative President Bush announced a $1.2 billion  hydrogen initiative  during his State of the Union address. The initiative will include $720 million in new funding over the next five years to develop the technologies and infrastructure needed to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles and to generate electricity.  The initiative complements the President's FreedomCAR initiative, which is developing technologies needed to mass produce safe and affordable hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Through partnerships with industry, these two initiatives seek to make these vehicles cost effective for large numbers of Americans by 2020.                  The new hydrogen initiative and FreedomCAR will dramatically improve America's energy security by significantly reducing the need for imported oil, and are key components of the President's clean air and climate change strategies.  For more information about hydrogen technologies, see the   National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap .     WMPI Awarded DOE Grant to Develop Diesel Fuel The DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative grant program has approved a $100-million grant to Gilberton, Pennsylvania-based Waste Management and Processors, Inc. to develop a new program for converting coal sludge to diesel fuel with the Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid technology. The plant will be the first to commercialize this process and is expected to produce approximately 60 million gallons per day of domestic transportation fuel.     Ethanol Workshop to be Held in California The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the Nebraska Ethanol Board, and the Clean Fuels Development Coalition are cosponsoring a workshop titled, Ethanol in California: Opportunities for Increased Utilization and Production, on February 6, 2003 at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. The workshop will provide information on the possibilities for ethanol production in California. The workshop will focus on the various forms of ethanol available to Californians that can have a positive impact on air quality and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several other workshops are planned within the next two years at various locations. Register for this event at the  Clean Fuels Development Coalition  Web site or the  American Coalition for Ethanol  site.     Ford Agrees to Sell Think Nordic to Kamkorp Microelectronics Ford Motor Company signed a letter of intent in late December to sell Think Nordic, the Norwegian part of its EV business, to Kamkorp Microelectronics of Switzerland. The agreement will save 100 jobs at the Think Nordic plant in Aurskog, Norway. Ford announced in late August 2002 that it was abandoning its TH!NK brand of battery-powered EVs, focusing instead on developing hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. As part of the agreement, Kamkorp will also acquire the rights to the TH!NK and city brand names developed by Ford. Ford acquired the Norwegian plant in 1999, when it was operating under the PIVCO name.     Nissan Unveils UTC Fuel Cells A Nissan X-TRAIL FCV fuel cell vehicle powered by a UTC Fuel Cells (UTCFC) hydrogen power plant was the first produced under agreements signed between Nissan and UTCFC to develop fuel cells and fuel cell components for vehicles.  The zero-emission X-TRAIL FCV, a hybrid vehicle that draws its primary power from a 75-kW UTCFC ambient pressure fuel cell power plant, is fueled by compressed hydrogen. Nissan intends to start public road testing of the vehicle in Japan.  UTCFC is also developing fuel cells for the fleet vehicle market with partners Irisbus of Europe and Thor Industries of the United States. A Thor Industries' bus powered by a 75-kW fuel cell power plant unit entered passenger service in November with Sunline Transit Agency.     General Motors to Offer Hybrid Vehicles GM will offer hybrid options on several vehicles, starting later this year with the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups for use in commercial fleets. The hybrid versions of the trucks will increase fuel economy by 10% to 12%. The vehicles will be publicly available in 2004.  Depending on demand, GM may produce a million or more a year by 2007. In 2005, GM will begin producing a hybrid Saturn VUE sport utility. It will also include a hybrid option on its Chevy Equinox SUV in 2006 and its Chevy Malibu sedan in 2007. Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also plan hybrid models.  Buyers in some areas qualify for a federal tax deduction and local tax breaks. Even though a hybrid could cost $4,000 more than a conventional vehicle, an owner could save nearly $5,500 in gasoline expenses over the vehicle's driving life.

November  2003     NETL Publishes Fuel Cell Fact Sheet  The National Energy Technology Laboratory has published a fact sheet titled,   DOE's Fuel Cell Research Targets National Goals for Energy and the Environment , which details its fuel cell research and how that research correlates to three federal initiatives for energy and the environment: (1) Clear Skies Initiative, a comprehensive policy to reduce sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury emissions from the power generation sector; (2) Climate Change Initiative, which has the goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce GHG intensity 18% by 2012; and (3) Energy Security, which seeks to diversify energy resources, develop new technologies for distributed power, promote conservation, use domestic energy resources, and modernize energy delivery systems.     Workshop Tackles Biological Hydrogen Production  The results of a two-day workshop on  hydrogen production through biological and artificial systems  are now available. The workshop was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and hosted jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory.      The primary objective of the workshop was to define the future roles of biotechnology, biomimetic chemistry, and artificial photosynthesis in the development of innovative hydrogen production technologies.      Research into the sustainable production of hydrogen is crucial to the nation's future as the country moves toward energy independence. A better understanding of the organisms and biological processes that produce hydrogen naturally could lead to sustainable methods of producing hydrogen from sunlight and water. These might include totally artificial processes that mimic biology.      The workshop participants also identified important scientific challenges and a set of short- and long-term goals for research relating to hydrogen production.      Fossil Energy Web Site Highlights Hydrogen The U.S. Department of Energy's  Fossil Energy Web site  now has a section titled, Hydrogen and Other Clean Fuels. Readers can access information about President Bush's Hydrogen Initiative; technologies for producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, natural gas, and coal; and methods for delivering hydrogen. It discusses current technologies such as steam reforming of natural gas, as well as emerging hydrogen production technologies.     Propane School Bus Unveiled  The first dedicated propane school bus was unveiled at the Annual Conference and Trade Show of the National Association for Pupil Transportation. Built by Corbeil Bus, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis. It was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, with support from ProCon (a consortium of propane providers and equipment manufacturers), the Propane Vehicle Council, and the Propane Education & Research Council.    The school bus is a technology enhanced aftermarket model that features an 8.1-liter gasoline engine, now engineered to a dedicated propane system. It features a GMT 233 WB chassis, a cutaway chassis with a truck front end. The bus can be equipped to meet the needs of physically challenged students and is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.     The frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank manifold with a total usable capacity of more than 50 gallons of propane fuel. The manifold enables better packaging and delivery of propane fuel and is positioned between the frame rails to provide a robust and secure environment for durability and safety. The vehicle will be certified for all state, EPA, and CARB ULEV emission standards.     School districts in Texas, Oregon, and California have indicated their desire to order the new propane school bus. ProCon will accept orders from customers immediately.

First Clean-Fueled Snow Plow Truck Arrives on Long Island The New York State Department of Transportation retrofitted nine vehicles, including four snowplows and five medium-duty dump trucks, with clean-burning engines fueled by a 80% compressed natural gas and 20% diesel fuel. The first snowplow, unveiled at the seventh annual Alternative Fuel Vehicle Conference sponsored by the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition, has arrived on Long Island. The other snowplows, as well as five medium-duty dump trucks, are expected to be completed and delivered to the Long Island region by late spring 2004.  The trucks are being retrofitted under a $500,000 grant secured by NYSERDA, at a cost of approximately $28,000 per vehicle. They are being tested in Suffolk County, where they will help meet clean air goals.  During a seven-year period, each truck is expected to emit 3,000 pounds less nitrogen oxides and 90 pounds less particulate matter, reductions of 40% and 95%, respectively, and to reduce diesel fuel use by about 5,140 gallons per year.      Dedicated Propane Low-Floor Bus Chassis Unveiled The propane industry unveiled the first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis at BusCon 2003.  Built by Heart International, with funding from the Propane Education & Research Council and the U.S. Department of Energy, the bus is designed specifically for the General Motors Family-2 Commercial Cutaway Chassis with an 8.1 liter engine, engineered now to run on a dedicated propane system.  The Propane Promotion Consortium and the Propane Vehicle Council provided additional support to the project. The low-floor bus uses the Heart International kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the bus doors open.  With this technology and its completely flat, step-less interior, the bus complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and provides easy navigation for persons with strollers. Two body frame versionsone for park services and another for mass transit and airport shuttle serviceswill be offered.      Metro Denver Opens First Retail Biodiesel Fueling Station Trucking fleets, school districts, and diesel vehicle owners in the metro Denver area will soon have a convenient local source of biodiesel.  Blue Sun Biodiesel and Shoco Oil, Inc., announced the grand opening of Denver's first retail biodiesel fueling station in Commerce City. Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing biodiesel energy crops and infrastructure in cooperation with regional farmers, and implementing state-of-the art production and distribution facilities.  The Shoco Oil Commerce City facility is a 12-acre commercial fueling center that provides gasoline, on and off road diesel fuel, and quality lubricants.  Shoco currently services agricultural, construction, mining, school districts, and government fleets statewide.   Blue Sun Biodiesel is developing regional farmer cooperatives to produce biodiesel feedstock from crops adapted to arid high plains growing conditions. There are 5.6 million acres of dryland winter wheat in the region, and oilseed crops added to the rotation could bring farmers an additional $280 million in revenues per year.  As a domestic source of energy that reduces harmful emissions and greenhouse gases, biodiesel will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and improve our health and environment.     Low-Floor Bus Chassis Ready for Ordering The first dedicated propane low-floor bus chassis was built by Heart International, with funding from PERC and DOE, and additional support from ProCon and the Propane Vehicle Council. The width of the frame is designed to accommodate a three-tank module with a total usable capacity of 65 gallons of propane fuel. It is an environmentally friendly low-floor bus that effectively caters to the needs of mass transit, parks, and airport shuttle services.  The low-floor bus uses kneeling technology, which enables the bus to automatically lower when the doors open, while still employing rear-wheel-drive reliability. The frame is lowered 14 inches. Modified front leaf springs and auxiliary air springs lower the cab two inches and provide standard front kneeling, in addition to improved steering control. Independent rear suspension, which uses a twist channel beam suspension, provides greater flexibility than a solid rear axle. Rear air springs provide optional kneeling in any direction when combined with the standard auxiliary front air springs.  A completely flat, step-less interior allows the bus to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Access for persons in wheelchairs and with strollers is at the same entry point as for all other passengers.    October   2003     Trolleys to Roll in Downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana The Capitol Park Trolley, a new natural gas trolley system for the downtown Baton Rouge area, will provide efficient transportation for visitors and for those working in the area. It will also be an incentive to patronize downtown businesses, thus helping revitalize downtown. The trolley, the first mass transit program in Louisiana to operate on natural gas, will run Monday through Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and will be free.  Initially, the route will run from the Sheraton, north down River Road, up to Third Street to the north end of Capitol Park, south down Fourth Street and back around to the Sheraton.  There are approximately 15 convenient stops on the route and the waiting period to catch a trolley is estimated to be six minutes.  Funding for the project was identified in May 2003 through Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds.  The Commissioner's Office, in conjunction with Plan Baton Rouge, the Downtown Development District, and Capital Transportation Corporation, worked to secure approvals for funding from the Mayor's Office, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, and the Federal Transit Authority.  The cost of the three-year project is approximately $1.6 million for infrastructure, operation and maintenance costs: $1.3 million in federal CMAQ funds and $300,000 in state matching funds. The State and the Capital Transportation Corporation have entered into a cooperative endeavor agreement to operate the service for three years with the option to expand service when deemed necessary and additional funding becomes available.       Kansas-Grown Fuel Available at the Pump The first fueling station in Wichita to offer E85 has opened at The new Kwik Shop. The number of ethanol-producing plants in Kansas has increased, but the state has been slower than others in the Midwest to make ethanol blends available. Kansas has five operating ethanol plants: Abengoa, U.S. Energy Partners at Russell, MGP at Atchison, Reeves AgriEnergy at Garden City, and ESE at Leoti. All but MGP use either corn or grain sorghum as feedstock.  MGP uses wheat to produce gluten, fuel ethanol, and beverage alcohol. A dozen more plants are in the works or under consideration. The legislature has provided new incentives for ethanol use and state cars now burn ethanol blends.  In addition, new cars purchased for the state fleet will be capable of burning E85.     Monsanto, GM, and NEVC Partner for E85 Infrastructure The Monsanto Company recently announced a multi-million dollar, two-year partnership among General Motors and the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to establish new E85 fueling locations and to deliver improved corn for the dry mill ethanol industry.    As a part of this initative, Monsanto is launching a new program titled Fuel Your Profits, a processor preferred high fermentable corn solutions package offered to dry mill ethanol plants and corn growers.  Growers can participate by selecting an enrolled dry mill ethanol plant, then committing to plant and deliver the grain over the next two years.  Producers will then be eligible to receive discounts on GM flexible-fuel vehicles and an E85 fueling location.   GM has more than one million vehicles on the road that can burn E85, and has increased ethanol demand through its E85 awareness efforts with NEVC. The NEVC is committed to advancing ethanol, E85 use, and the ethanol infrastructure.  This program with Monsanto and GM will increase availability of E85 fueling sites and increase demand for E85 as farmers acquire GM flexible-fuel vehicles.      USDA Provides Biodiesel Fuel Education Program Grants The National Biodiesel Board and the University of Idaho will receive $960,000 from the USDA to conduct a biodiesel fuel education program. The National Biodiesel Board was awarded $770,000 to create educational programming and the University of Idaho was awarded $190,000 to provide technical support for the effort. The purpose of the grants, which were competitively awarded, is to develop an educational program to target governmental and private entities that operate vehicle fleets. The program will address issues previously identified by fleet operators and other potential fuel users, including the need to balance the positive environmental, social, and human health effects of biodiesel consumption with the increased cost per gallon. These grants will also be used to inform other interested groups and the public about biodiesel use.      Knoxville Adds Propane Hybrid Trolleys to AFV Fleet The  East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition (ETCFC)  recently announced that Knoxville Area Transit (KAT) will soon debut four propane-powered hybrid electric trolleys to serve downtown Knoxville as part of KAT's Clean Fuels Program.            KAT currently operates five dedicated propane vans that serve the University of Tennessee, and aims to operate almost completely on alternative fuels within the next five years. KAT's plans call for vans, trolleys, and possibly some buses to run on propane, and for some buses to operate on B20.        The first hybrid electric trolley is scheduled to begin operating in October; the remainder are set to begin service in December.     GEM Donates 75 Vehicles to City of Boston and 2004 Democratic Convention Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler, donated 75 vehicles to the City of Boston and the 2004 Democratic convention. The donation completes a program in which more than 2,000 GEM vehicles have been provided to municipalities and charitable and service organizations.  GEMs are classified by the federal government as low speed vehicles, and have a top speed of 25 mph. They are alternatives to full-size automobiles for short trips, and are primary people movers on corporate, academic, and military campuses.  GEMs went into production four years ago, and now more than 26,000 are on roads with 35 mph or lower speed limits across the country.      1st Annual University Student Hydrogen Design Contest To help develop the hydrogen economy and engage students in the progression of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, the National Hydrogen Association and the U.S. Department of Energy are looking for innovative and imaginative designs for a next-generation hydrogen fueling station.

Selections are expected to include one winning team and four honorable mention teams. The winning team will receive an all expense paid trip to Hollywood, California, to present its winning design at a plenary session of the 2004 NHA Annual Conference. The four honorable mention teams will be invited to give poster presentations of their work and will receive free conference registration and materials. All five teams will receive awards at a ceremony preceding the presentation of the winning entry.    September 2003     Lansing, Michigan, Joins DOE's Clean Cities Program DOE designated the Greater Lansing Clean Cities Coalition as the newest member of its Clean Cities Program on September 26. Earning such a designation from the program is not a simple task: The Lansing group has been working for seven years to advance the use of alternative fuels in the area. After the City of Lansing partnered with St. Johns and other area communities and groups, DOE helped the coalition to build a market foundation for alternative fuel vehicles, form its own group of stakeholders, hold meetings, identify a coordinator, define goals, and develop an action plan to achieve those goals. The Clean Cities designation recognizes the coalition as working to strengthen the nation's energy security, improve air quality and stimulate the local economy by creating new alternative fuel markets. See the  September 26 press release  on the DOE Web site.     Green Cars Start Their Engines Numerous automakers, as well as a few tinkerers, showcased 100 environmentally friendly cars and trucks at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. The vehicles, including plug-in electrics, hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and diesels, were put through testing for this eco-vehicle gathering. Japanese automakers are focusing on hybrids, and American manufacturers are promoting vehicles that would replace the internal combustion engine with fuel cells. European carmakers are focusing on diesel engines.         The vehicles were tested on drive by noise, fuel efficiency, exhaust emissions, acceleration, braking, slalom driving, and fuel efficiency. The friendly competition included an individual who spent $5,000 to convert a pickup truck to run on hydrogen, natural gas, propane, and gasoline, as well as any combination. Test drives of futuristic fuel cell prototypes were also offered.      Innovative Transit Bus Focuses on the Future The   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  is collaborating with other government agencies and the automotive industry to develop a bus that is designed to capture the nostalgia and appeal of the buses driven in Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s. The new yellow bus carries 16 to 32 passengers, can use an alternative fuel, features a low floor, and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.    The bus is built on a General Motors T-560 medium-duty chassis with a gross vehicle weight of 19,000-26,000 pounds. It took three years to design and build. Instead of conventional shocks, the bus rides on compressed air, which is released to lower the bus for boarding. It is designed to run on natural gas. Eventually, similar buses will be manufactured using several optional engines, to allow use of alternative fuels like natural gas, propane, ethanol, and biodiesel. Its purposes are to protect the national park's pristine environment and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.      Biodiesel Carries New Weight Premium The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) has passed a new definition for premium diesel, and the changes are good news for biodiesel. Lubricity is now is considered in determining whether a fuel can be classified as a premium diesel fuel. Independent tests show just 1% biodiesel can increase the lubricity of petroleum diesel by as much as 65%.  The NCWM list now includes cetane, cold flow properties, thermal stability, and lubricity. This important development makes the positive lubricity benefit of biodiesel a premium attribute. The changes will appear in the 2004 NIST Handbook 130.   August    2003     Pump Lets Natural Gas Civics Go to Market In 2004 Honda will begin mass-marketing natural gas-powered Civics that will come with a device to fill the tank in a garage. This is the first time an automaker will sell a natural gas vehicle broadly to the public. Until now, sales have been mostly limited to specialized fleets such as airport vans and university campus vehicles. Since 1998, Honda has sold 500 to 1,000 natural gas Civic GX models per year to customers such as the New York Department of Transportation. They are popular for commercial fleets that travel short distances and have their own filling stations. The drawback to widespread sales has been the lack of an easy, reliable way to fuel the vehicles. Honda will sell an appliance, called Phill, with each Civic GX to fill the tank from a home gas line. Phill will cost $2,000, but tax credits may knock the end cost down to $1,000. The Civic GX will cost about $20,000. Honda views the market as mostly second and commuter cars.   Phill, made by Toronto-based Fuelmaker, requires 8 hours to half-fill a vehicle, good for 100 miles. GX owners also can refill at approximately 1,300 natural gas stations nationwide. Filling stations that dispense compressed natural gas under pressure can fill a tank in three to five minutes.Running a vehicle on natural gas historically costs about 80% of what it costs to run on gasoline.  Honda views natural gas as a critical bridge to acceptance of hydrogen-powered vehicles it expects to sell in large numbers by 2015. By putting Phills in garages, Honda hopes people will accept the idea of hydrogen fuel cell generators in their garages later. Compared with gasoline, natural gas emits 70% less carbon monoxide, 87% less nitrogen oxide, and 20% less carbon dioxide.      New E85 Tank in Amarillo, Texas The second E85 station in Texas will soon be pumping E85. The new 10,000-gallon E85 tank is located near Amarillo, Texas, and also offers biodiesel and unleaded gasoline for its 300-vehicle fleet.  BWXT Pantex, which manages and operates the Pantex nuclear weapons facility for the National Nuclear Security Administration, will initially use E85 in about 85 vehicles, and hopes to have more than 200 flexible-fuel vehicles in the next two years. Pantex installed this tank to help the plant comply with Executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease its petroleum use by 20% by 2005.  For a complete list of E85 locations, visit the >a href=""www.E85Fuel.com"">National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition Web site.     DOE Releases 25-Year Strategic Plan DOE released a 25-year plan that spells out a general vision and specific technologies and projects it hopes to develop.

The City plans to replace 2-3 buses per year if funding is available. Contact:  Tom Logan  at 956 541 5281.     City of Berkeley Fleet Goes Biodiesel The City of Berkeley celebrated a milestone by becoming the first city of its size in the United States to transition to 100% biodiesel in its diesel vehicles. The city held an exhibit and ceremony to celebrate the occasion that featured a variety of diesel vehicles from the departments of Public Works, Parks, Fire, Police, and Health and Human Services.       Biodiesel works in any diesel engine with few or no modifications. Among its advantages, according to EPA, are considerably reducing the emissions produced by petroleum-based diesel. It is safer to transport, store, and use, because it is not a hazardous material like petroleum products. Biodiesel also reduces dependence on foreign oil.

King County to Lead National Cooperative Purchase of Hybrid Vehicles King County, Washington, will lead a new national initiative to help state and local governments purchase low-emission, energy-efficient fleet vehicles. Through U.S. Communities, a national cooperative purchasing alliance, local and state agencies will pool their purchasing power to obtain fuel-saving hybrid vehicles. By piggybacking on the King County solicitation, governments can obtain favorable contract arrangements for hybrid vehicles and promote a voluntary approach to limiting pollution and reducing greenhouse gases from their fleets. The program is sponsored by U.S. Communities, the National Association of Counties, and the Center for a New American Dream. King County and the project sponsors will develop the national solicitation for hybrid vehicles over the next few months. The organizations also will identify the agencies most likely to purchase significant volumes of hybrid vehicles and the exact vehicle types wanted. State, county, city, school,and regional government entities will be able to join the solicitation once it is complete. The solicitation will be available for bidding in late 2003 or early 2004. For more information, visit the  Center for a New American Dream  Web site.     First Station Pumping E85 in Connecticut The first E85 fueling facility in Connecticut (a 6,000-gallon tank) began pumping on June 25, 2003.  The site at the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) in Newington plans to fuel about 475 flexible-fuel vehicles. Plans are for another 334 vehicles to be reassigned near the facility to take advantage of the pump.  ConnDOT continues to work with the Department of Administrative Services Fleet Operations Office and the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition to expand E85 availability into other key areas of Connecticut.     There are no ethanol producers in the state, but this new facility is the beginning of long-term efforts to make E85 available at readily accessible locations in all 50 states.

Six High Schools Win Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge Six high school teams were winners today of the first Hydrogen Fuel Cell Model Car Challenge, part of the DOE National Science Bowl. The teams of four students in each race received $1,000 for their science departments. Ten of the 66 National Science Bowl high school teams competed in the Model Car Challenge by designing, building, testing, and racing hydrogen fuel cell model cars. The cars were no larger than one foot wide and two feet long.  The cars used electricity from small solar panels to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen. The teams then stored the hydrogen on the car and used it to run a fuel cell that generated electricity to power a motor. Since no combustion was involved, the only by-products were heat and water. Engineers from DOE, and GM provided technical advice. GM provided the model car components.   Visit the  Office of Science Web site  for information on the teams and on the National Science Bowl.

GM, BMW to Develop Hydrogen Fueling Technology GM and the BMW Group will work together to develop fueling technology for liquid hydrogen vehicles and will invite other automakers and suppliers to join them. GM said BMW is an ideal partner because the German automaker has done extensive research on liquid hydrogen.  Every major automaker is working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, most with fuel cells. GM and BMW say their goal is to have affordable and compelling hydrogen vehicles for sale by 2010. A key to meeting that goal is developing ways to store and handle the fuel easily.  Compressed and liquid hydrogen both hold promise for hydrogen-powered vehicles, but liquid hydrogen's density is especially attractive with respect to fuel distribution. The collaborative work will center around setting global standards for fueling equipment, both on vehicles and at retail locations, and establishing specifications for suppliers.      Fuel Cell Vehicles to Number 800,000 by 2012 The number of FCVs that will be introduced to the world in the coming decade will reach 800,000 by 2012, according to a new study by Allied Business Intelligence. FCVs will contribute critical knowledge for early rollouts in niche markets in the second half of this decade, according to the study. ABI believes that greater attention is finally being given to fuel cells, and there is as much awareness in the European Union as there is in Japan. The United States will have to more aggressively execute its strategy of solving technological challenges and infrastructure layouts if it is to help early FCV introduction by the second half of the decade.  ABI has updated its forecasts for FCV shipments and its analysis of the changing global fuel cell business environment. The study exposes regional characteristics of the automotive fuel cell sector and outlines a timeline for potential fuel cell penetration in the next 10 years.     Abraham Calls for International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy At the International Energy Agency Ministerial meeting, DOE Secretary Abraham called for an international collaboration in advanced R&D that will support the deployment of hydrogen energy technologies. A growing number of countries have committed to accelerate the development of hydrogen energy technologies to improve their energy, economic, and environmental security. The United States has committed $1.7 billion for the first five years of a long-term R&D program for hydrogen, hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cells, and hybrid vehicle technologies. The European Union has committed up to 2 billion Euros to long-term R&D of renewable and hydrogen energy technologies.   April     2003     EPA Calls for Grant Proposals to Retrofit Diesel Vehicles  The EPA announced plans to offer 5 to 10 grants of $50,000 to $100,000 (totaling $500,000) to public and private school bus fleets, waste haulers, private trucking fleets, locomotives, construction fleets, and agricultural fleets that agree to retrofit diesel engines with improved or new  technologies that reduce diesel exhaust emissions. Technologies will be primarily targeted to reduce particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.       Applications for the grants must be submitted no later than May 22.

United States Settles Clean Air Act Case Against Toyota DOJ and EPA finalized a settlement of a government lawsuit against Toyota Motor Corporation for Clean Air Act violations involving 2.2 million vehicles manufactured between 1996 and 1998. Under the settlement, Toyota will spend $20 million on a supplemental environmental project to retrofit as many as 3,000 high polluting public diesel vehicles (including school buses and municipal fleets) with pollution control equipment. Toyota will also accelerate its compliance with certain new emission control requirements and pay a $500,000 civil penalty. The settlement will cost Toyota an estimated $34 million. Labor and subcontractor costs may not be credited against the $20 million spending requirement.  Parts and equipment provided by entities in which Toyota has a financial interest may be credited against the $20 million spending requirement, provided that such parts and equipment are valued at their actual cost.  Toyota has 180 days to complete and submit a plan to EPA, and then has 5 years to complete the project.     Oklahoma's DRV Energy Wins EPA ULEV Certifications DRV Energy secured a 49-state EPA approval for three new kits for aftermarket conversions of GM engines to natural gas.

This installation marks the first Army base to carry two types of alternative fuels. The 10,000 gallon E85 tank will fuel the 42 E85 FFVs at the base.  This number is expected to grow by 75-80 in the next few months.  The project was initiated in 2001 to comply with executive Order 13149, which requires the federal government to decrease petroleum use by 20% by 2005.    Ethanol production in Missouri currently exceeds 45 million gallons per year, and a number of other plants are being considered. The NEVC will help the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy establish E85 fueling sites at other military bases in 2003.     DOE Says Private and Local AFV Mandates Not Necessary DOE issued a Notice of Public Rulemaking  (PDF 204  KB)  announcing that private fleet and local government fleet mandates are not necessary and therefore should not be imposed under EPAct. According to the rule, additional fleet mandates would not significantly reduce American dependence on fossil fuels.  DOE said that even if it did impose acquisition requirements, market conditions could result in their eventual suspension because there is little alternative fuel infrastructure, suitable AFVs are not available, and some alternative fuels cost more than conventional motor fuels.    The decision will apply to business fleets and local government fleets, and will eliminate potential mandates for law enforcement fleets and transit buses. However, mandates already in place for state governments and fuel provider fleets remain in force. There is a 90-day period for interested parties to submit written comments on this determination. DOE will issue its final determination in late summer or fall.     GM and NEVC Advance the Use of E85 General Motors Corporation  announced a multimillion dollar campaign to promote the use of corn-based ethanol fuel E85 as an alternative to gasoline. Today, ethanol made from corn reduces the demand for imported oil by 98,000 barrels per day, representing a $1.1 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit. In the future, ethanol may be produced from biomass feedstocks. There are currently more than 3 million E85 vehicles on American roads. The public awareness effort is a 2-year partnership with the nonprofit  National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition  focused on increasing ethanol use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs), which are designed to use either ethanol or gasoline; E85 FFVs can be powered by gasoline or a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.   The ethanol promotion effort will begin in Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois. The campaign will include a variety of tactics, including information made available to customers at dealerships, direct mail, advertising, and on-line activities.     Tour De Sol: The Great American Green Transportation Festival The  Tour De Sol  culminates in May in a series of festivals and a road-rally competition in the Northeast.

Some will likely use on-site natural gas reforming technology. BP will be the largest fuel supplier to the DaimlerChrysler project that will bring 30 fuel cell transit buses to 10 European cities over the next few years. By reforming natural gas on site, the stations will be able to avoid storing large quantities of hydrogen and will not need constant truck deliveries of the fuel. Technology is being developed to fuel a small fleet of light-duty passenger vehicles each day. Its success would allow relatively low-cost, moderately sized natural gas reformation units at service stations throughout the United States, and in countries with readily available supplies of natural gas. Most service stations in the United States already have access to natural gas pipelines.     Bush Administration Eases Regulations on Electric Bicycles President Bush signed HR 727 into law, which eases the regulatory requirements for electric bicycles with less than 1 hp and a maximum speed of 20 mph. The bill transfers the responsibility for regulating electric bicycles from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This means they are not subject to many of the same standards as motor vehicles, but will be regulated as bicycles. These human-electric hybrid bicycles are operated by human pedaling and electric batteries. They achieve the equivalent of 1000 mpg.   February  2003     SEP Special Projects Solicitation The State Energy Program Special Projects Solicitation was announced February 14, 2003.

Fetzer acquired three Ford Ranger EVs on a three-year lease, and has ordered another.  Initially, GreenLease was available only as a net lease; however, a TRAC (open-end) lease is now available. A net lease permits fleets to return the AFV at lease end without further obligation (except for excess wear and tear and excess mileage); under a TRAC lease, the customer assumes the responsibility for the residual value of the vehicle at lease end. Compressed natural gas, electric, ethanol, and propane vehicles are eligible for a GreenLease.

The Bio-Beetle gives the public the opportunity to drive a renewably fueled car and offers them firsthand experience that renewable fuels are available and that they work.  Bio-Beetle will purchase all its fuel from Pacific Biodiesel, who makes all its fuel from used cooking oil.   January   2003     Bush Announces Hydrogen Initiative President Bush announced a $1.2 billion  hydrogen initiative  during his State of the Union address. The initiative will include $720 million in new funding over the next five years to develop the technologies and infrastructure needed to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles and to generate electricity.  The initiative complements the President's FreedomCAR initiative, which is developing technologies needed to mass produce safe and affordable hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Through partnerships with industry, these two initiatives seek to make these vehicles cost effective for large numbers of Americans by 2020.                  The new hydrogen initiative and FreedomCAR will dramatically improve America's energy security by significantly reducing the need for imported oil, and are key components of the President's clean air and climate change strategies.  For more information about hydrogen technologies, see the   National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap .     WMPI Awarded DOE Grant to Develop Diesel Fuel The DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative grant program has approved a $100-million grant to Gilberton, Pennsylvania-based Waste Management and Processors, Inc. to develop a new program for converting coal sludge to diesel fuel with the Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid technology. The plant will be the first to commercialize this process and is expected to produce approximately 60 million gallons per day of domestic transportation fuel.     Ethanol Workshop to be Held in California The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the Nebraska Ethanol Board, and the Clean Fuels Development Coalition are cosponsoring a workshop titled, Ethanol in California: Opportunities for Increased Utilization and Production, on February 6, 2003 at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. The workshop will provide information on the possibilities for ethanol production in California.

Several other workshops are planned within the next two years at various locations. Register for this event at the  Clean Fuels Development Coalition  Web site or the  American Coalition for Ethanol  site.     Ford Agrees to Sell Think Nordic to Kamkorp Microelectronics Ford Motor Company signed a letter of intent in late December to sell Think Nordic, the Norwegian part of its EV business, to Kamkorp Microelectronics of Switzerland. The agreement will save 100 jobs at the Think Nordic plant in Aurskog, Norway. Ford announced in late August 2002 that it was abandoning its TH!NK brand of battery-powered EVs, focusing instead on developing hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. As part of the agreement, Kamkorp will also acquire the rights to the TH!NK and city brand names developed by Ford. Ford acquired the Norwegian plant in 1999, when it was operating under the PIVCO name.     Nissan Unveils UTC Fuel Cells A Nissan X-TRAIL FCV fuel cell vehicle powered by a UTC Fuel Cells (UTCFC) hydrogen power plant was the first produced under agreements signed between Nissan and UTCFC to develop fuel cells and fuel cell components for vehicles.  The zero-emission X-TRAIL FCV, a hybrid vehicle that draws its primary power from a 75-kW UTCFC ambient pressure fuel cell power plant, is fueled by compressed hydrogen. Nissan intends to start public road testing of the vehicle in Japan.  UTCFC is also developing fuel cells for the fleet vehicle market with partners Irisbus of Europe and Thor Industries of the United States. A Thor Industries' bus powered by a 75-kW fuel cell power plant unit entered passenger service in November with Sunline Transit Agency.     General Motors to Offer Hybrid Vehicles GM will offer hybrid options on several vehicles, starting later this year with the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups for use in commercial fleets. The hybrid versions of the trucks will increase fuel economy by 10% to 12%. The vehicles will be publicly available in 2004.  Depending on demand, GM may produce a million or more a year by 2007. In 2005, GM will begin producing a hybrid Saturn VUE sport utility. It will also include a hybrid option on its Chevy Equinox SUV in 2006 and its Chevy Malibu sedan in 2007. Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also plan hybrid models.  Buyers in some areas qualify for a federal tax deduction and local tax breaks. Even though a hybrid could cost $4,000 more than a conventional vehicle, an owner could save nearly $5,500 in gasoline expenses over the vehicle's driving life.

DOCUMENTED VESSELS    Vessels documented with the U. S. Coast Guard as commercial are not required to be registered with the state. Vessels documented as pleasure are required to register, however, they do not have to display the Alabama registration number on the bow. The current year decal should be placed in a conspicuous location on the vessel and the certificate shall be on board when in operation.     ALABAMA DOES NOT REQUIRE BOAT TRAILERS TO BE LICENSED AND DOES NOT HAVE A TITLE LAW ON BOATS     MEASURING THE LENGTH OF YOUR VESSEL    It is important that you list the exact length of your vessel on the application for registration. The length is the straight line distance from the foremost part of the boat (bow) to the rearmost part of the boat (stern). Bowsprits, outboard motors brackets, rudders and other attachments are not to be included in this measurement.        Boats are divided into four (4) classes as follows:    Class I        -    Less than 4.9 meters (16ft)  Class II       -    4.9 meters (16ft) to less than 7.9 meters (26ft)  Class III      -    7.9 meters (26ft) to less than 12.2 meters (40ft)  Class IV      -    12.2 meters (40ft) and above     FEES    First Time and Renewal    Class I        -    $11.00 plus $1.00 issuance fee  Class II       -    $15.00 plus $1.00 issuance fee  Class III      -    $30.00 plus $1.00 issuance fee  Class IV      -     $50.00 plus $1.00 issuance fee  Class V        -    $26.00 for initial, $4.00 for each   (Dealer)       -    additional dealer tag    Transfer    -    $1.00 plus .25 issuance fee   (Applies to vessels with a current year registration but needs to be transferred into new owner's name)    Transfer/Renewal - $1.00 plus .25 and the correct class fee applies to vessels with no current registration and needs to be transferred into new owner's name    NOTE: IF YOUR VESSEL IS BROUGHT INTO ALABAMA FROM ANOTHER STATE, THERE WILL BE NO TRANSFER FEE CHARGED, A NEW ALABAMA NUMBER WILL BE ISSUED. ALSO, IF PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED IN ANOTHER STATE, PLEASE SURRENDER LAST STATE REGISTRATION    Duplicate    -    .50 plus .25 issuance fee (certificate has either been lost or destroyed)     WHERE TO APPLY    All boat owners may register, renew or transfer ownership at their office of county Judge of Probate or License Commissioner. If not a resident of Alabama, registration can be accomplished,  with proof of payment of sales and use tax ,at the Marine Police Division office in Montgomery, AL. All dealer and livery (rental) must register with the Marine Police Division in Montgomery, AL.  Liveries (rental) and dealer licenses can only be issued from the Marine Police Division office in Montgomery.      WHEN TO APPLY    There is a 72 hour grace period for the registration of a new boat.    If you buy a used boat that is currently registered with this state, you must make application for transfer within 15 days.    If you buy a used boat with an expired registration, you must currently register the boat before it is used.    If you buy a boat that was used for rental purposes, the old number will have to be removed from the boat and a new one issued. No transfer will be necessary in this case.    There is no grace period for a used boat.    The Alabama boat registration system is on a staggered basis. The first letter of an individual's last name determines the month of renewal. The renewal months in which a vessel owner shall register his vessel(s) is indicated below:    January - A, D  February - B  March- C, E  April - F, G, N  May-H, O  June-M, I  July- P, L  August-J, K, R  September-Q, S, T  October-U, V, W, X, Y, Z and all registered under company names. All dealers and liveries.     WHAT IS REQUIRED WHEN YOU SELL YOUR BOAT    1.    Notify the Marine Police Division within 15 days of sale of vessel, specifying the name and address of the new owner and the registration number assigned to the vessel.    2.    Provide new owner with the last registration certificate and a bill of sale.      Notify the Marine Police Division within 15 days when your boat is abandoned, lost, destroyed or stolen. Also, any change of address should be reported.       NUMBERING YOUR VESSEL    Your permanent registration number appears on the right- hand side of the certificate preceded by the letters AL. The number contains 1 to 4 digits plus the 2-letter suffix following the number. This number remains with the boat regardless of change of ownership within the state.    The registration number must be placed on each side of the bow of the vessel for which it was purchased, in such a position as will make it clearly visible at all times. The number must be displayed in three parts with a hyphen or space separating each part, i.e.: AL-1234-AA, and be of a color that contrasts with the background of the boat -- dark on light or light on dark. Numbers shall be BLOCK characters, not less that 76 mm (3 inches) in height, excluding borders and must be of good proportion. Characters of varying thickness, slanted characters, and scroll-type characters are not acceptable. No number other than the number issued shall be displayed on either side of the bow. The validation decal must be affixed within 152 mm (6 inches) before or after and in line with the registration number on port and starboard bow.      HOMEMADE VESSELS    Homemade boats built after 1972 are required to have a hull serial number.    Boat owners registering a homemade vessel shall apply with the Marine Police Division for a hull serial number to affixed to the transom of their boat. It is necessary to give the date construction was completed.     HULL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER    All vessels manufactured after 1972 are required by Federal Law to have a hull identification number affixed to the vessel by the manufacturer.

Some advantages of driving an HEV are the improvement in fuel economy and the decrease in emissions. Three HEVs are currently on the market: the Honda Insight, the Toyota Prius, and the Honda Civic Hybrid. The Toyota Prius has outsold the Honda Insight in past years, probably because of its larger passenger capacity. No sales data are available for the Honda Civic Hybrid, as it was made available in Spring 2002.

GX225-65-7757980	"October 27, 2000                                    CTTS' battery testing and modeling activities  presented at symposium    CTTS staff members met an October DOE milestone when they presented papers at the 17th International Electric Vehicle Symposium, Oct. 15-18 in Montreal, Canada.  Valerie Johnson and Ahmad Pesaran presented their  paper on ""temperature-dependent battery models for high-power lithium-ion batteries,"" during a dialogue session. Written by Johnson, Pesaran, and Saft America, the paper compares two battery models for Saft's high-power lithium-ion cell. The two models also were compared to and validated with experimental data for a particular driving cycle.     Matt Keyser presented a paper on ""charging algorithms for increasing the lead-acid battery life cycle for electric vehicles."" Keyser's presentation was based on a paper he wrote along with Ahmad Pesaran, Mark Mihalic, and industry partners. The paper explored work conducted by NREL's battery thermal management team, Recombination Technologies, and Optima Batteries with funding from the Advanced Lead Acid Battery Consortium. In an effort to improve the life cycle of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries, the team developed charging algorithms that dramatically improved the deep discharge life cycle of these batteries, making them more competitive with other types of batteries for use in electric vehicles.                                         ADVISOR interactive interface demonstrated    CTTS' vehicle systems analysis team is working on developing an additional optional graphic-based interface that will allow ADVISOR users to interact with the simulation while it is running rather than simply when the run is completed.  The new window presents details about emissions, gas mileage, speed, what gear the vehicle is in, and force components such as rolling resistance, ascent, air drag, and acceleration.  The interactive nature of the interface allows users to adjust acceleration and grade, and might soon allow them to control the shifting of gears.  The new window allows users to immediately see the results through the graphics presented on the screen.  All this occurs before the standard engineering information that ADVISOR normally generates is revealed.    CTTS engineers are designing the new interactive interface using software by  Altia , a company that specializes in graphics that maximize the value of simulation models.  Altia experts recently visited the lab to train the CTTS team on the software's capabilities.   The new interactive interface option will probably be included in the next public release of ADVISOR.    Vehicle ventilation experiment to begin soon    CTTS' vehicle auxiliary loads reduction team is leading a new experiment to test passive and active ventilation techniques for vehicles. The experiment is aimed at reducing the differential temperature between the inside and outside of a vehicle by using passive (vents) or active (fans run on batteries) ventilation systems. The goal is to improve fuel efficiency and passenger comfort and enable vehicle manufacturers to reduce air conditioner sizing. Presently, fuel efficiency decreases about 25% when a vehicle starts while the air conditioner is on.     Plans are underway to convert a room at NREL's Field Test Laboratory Building into a vehicle testing lab, which will provide a place to carry out the experiment.  The experiment is expected to run for a few months.    Psychological thermal comfort study in the works    A ""request for proposals"" was recently posted in the  Commerce Business Daily  for  companies to work with NREL on designing a model to simulate the psychological effects on humans when a vehicle's inside temperature varies. This study is part of a DOE/OAAT project to build a life-size thermal manikin that will closely simulate how a human passenger responds to heat, cold, and a changing thermal environment inside an automobile. The purpose of the project is to design automobile heating, cooling, and ventilation systems that keep passengers comfortable in any weather and use less energy than conventional climate control technologies.    The psychological model and a physiological model will be coupled with the thermal manikin and will input the manikin's skin surface temperatures and compute the response of the body to a given external thermal environment. The system will then be tested and validated against humans in subjective tests. A number of industry partners have expressed interest in participating during the testing phase.    CTTS collaborates with industry partner on glazing tests    A representative of the vehicle auxiliary loads reduction team recently visited  PPG Industries  to tour its laboratories in Pittsburgh, Penn., and discuss a collaborative vehicle testing project.  One of the largest glazing producers for transportation and building applications, PPG operates about 110 manufacturing and seven research facilities worldwide.    Hybrid buses help keep Denver's air clean    Members of CTTS' vehicle systems analysis and battery thermal management teams last week attended a meeting that focused on the hybrid electric transit buses now in use on the16th Street Mall in Denver.  Dale Hill of Transteq provided an overview of the bus technology, which incorporates a series hybrid-electric-vehicle design.     Shuttle buses are the only vehicles allowed on the pedestrian mall.  The duty cycle is quite severe with many stops and hard acceleration events.  NREL engineers previously collected drive cycle data from the mall route, which was included in the latest public release of ADVISOR.  CTTS hopes to continue communications with Transteq engineers to build on their wealth of test data and learn from their experiences during the development of the hybrid bus.     The bus' 2.5-L natural gas engine drives an electric generator that maintains the battery pack's state of charge.  The battery pack is composed of 26 Optima ""yellow-top"" lead-acid batteries. The vehicle is propelled by two 220 hp traction motors.  The bus' low floor design allows easy access and incorporates dent resistant thermal plastic body panels.     Several hybrid electric buses are now in regular service on the mall route; plans are underway to expand the advanced fleet in the near future.  The move by Denver to choose hybrid electric buses that run on compressed natural gas is seen as a way to demonstrate advanced technologies and keep the city's air clean. It is expected that the buses will provide significant fuel savings and dramatically reduced emissions compared to diesel buses.   Hosted by the Colorado section of the Society for Automotive Engineers and the Denver Electric Vehicle Coalition, the meeting was held at the Regional Transportation District's Market Street Station.    Fueling advanced transportation vehicles at home    Following Denver Mayor Wellington Webb's Summit on Natural Gas Vehicles, Sept. 27-28, NREL was approached by a public/private consortium to engage in a project that will integrate advanced transportation vehicles with homes.  Stay tuned for more information as this project is further explored; or, if you would like to become involved, contact Terry Penney at (303) 275-4434 or  terry_penney@nrel.gov .                               Transportation workshop explores alternative fuels, advanced vehicles     As part of NREL's energy awareness month activities, a public workshop on transportation technologies was held on Oct. 19 at the Visitors Center.  Debbie Brodt-Giles gave an overview of CTTS and provided information resources (Clean Cities and Web-based tools).  Ken Kelly discussed transportation and energy use trends and alternative fuels research and development.  Sam Sprik followed with details on hybrid vehicle technologies.  After the presentations, the 30 workshop attendees enjoyed a first hand look at NREL's hybrid electric vehicles.      EREN features user-friendly transportation information    CTTS' technology integration and utilization group participated in the redesign of an on-line information resource for transportation technologies and issues.  The  transportation section  of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network now features up-to-date information about advanced fuels and vehicles; laws and incentives; air quality and vehicle emissions; and many other topics.                                       GM Precept prototype reaches 80 mpg    According to the  Hybrid Vehicle Bulletin ,  General Motors Corporation  recently announced that its hybrid electric Precept prototype car has achieved a fuel economy of 80 mpg. The automaker said the Precept is the first car under the government- and industry-supported Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles to reach the program's goal of designing a midsize, five-passenger car able to achieve 80 mpg without sacrificing safety, performance, or price.     The company said the prototype hybrid would get 90.9 mpg on the highway and 72.2 mpg in city driving.  The vehicle features an Isuzu three-cylinder diesel engine paired with two electric motors. One of the electric motors powers the vehicle's front wheels, while the second provides additional power to the diesel engine and acts as a generator to recharge the car's battery pack.     Chrysler to offer Durango hybrid by 2003      DaimlerChrysler  recently announced that its Chrysler arm will offer a hybrid electric version of the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2003. The company said the hybrid SUV will include an electric motor tied to a battery pack and will cost a few thousand dollars more than the conventionally-powered version.    The Durango hybrid will differ from other hybrid electric SUVs in that there will be no physical connection between the vehicle's electric motor and its gasoline engine. The SUV will feature a 3.9-liter V6 engine that will power the vehicle's back wheels, while an electric motor will power the front wheels. The company said it expects to build about 30,000 hybrid electric Durangos.     Hyundai sets out to develop advanced SUV    According to  Energies ,  Enova Systems  recently announced that it will work with Hyundai Motor Company and Capstone Turbine to develop a prototype hybrid drive system for Hyundai's Santa Fe sport utility vehicle based on Capstone's MicroTurbine ™. The prototype, which is expected to be ready for testing next year, is a series hybrid; the turbine generator energizes an electric drive motor.  The Santa Fe's 30-kilowatt turbine will power the vehicle while cruising. A battery pack will add a burst of energy for acceleration and hill climbing.    California drivers hit the road in shared cars     The challenge of providing the independence of personal vehicles while encouraging people to commute by subway or light-rail might be solved by the use of station-cars, according to  Energies .  Culminating its successful station-car pilot project in San Francisco, Hertz has opened a station-car facility at the Fremont, Bay Area Rapid Transit subway station. The facility will provide fully-fueled, clean, and maintained cars to ""home end users"" (those who need cars to travel from home to rail station) and ""corporate work site users"" (those who need cars to travel from rail station to work place).  Home end users will pay $375 per month, corporate users $325 per month.  The California Automobile Association estimates the cost of owning, operating, and maintaining a typical family vehicle in California is about $600 per month.   For the most part, vehicles provided in the program will be small gasoline-fueled cars, but Hertz will have a limited number of Ford TH!NK electric vehicles available for both station-car program participants and regular rentals.    Web site helps consumers choose low emission vehicles    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently posted a new Web site that features tailpipe emissions data and pollution rankings for all new passenger vehicles.  This comparative rank is based on the tailpipe emission standards of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, both of which contribute to the formation of smog.      The  Vehicle Emissions Guide  lists pollution levels for all model year 2000 and 2001 passenger vehicles sold in the United States, including cars, station wagons, pickup trucks, minivans, vans, and sport utility vehicles.  An emissions rank from 0 to 10 is assigned to each vehicle representing its cleanliness compared to all other vehicles and ranges.  For the 2001 model year, only certain versions of the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Prius, and Honda Accord earned top scores for low emissions.                                                    Committee reviews battery management system    An advisory committee recently met and reviewed the latest working battery management system prototype developed by University of Toledo under a subcontract with NREL.  The committee provides guidance for the project to develop a practical battery management system for hybrid electric vehicles that  monitors and controls the batteries to have safe and  high performance operation. The final prototype will be completed within a couple of months. Once completed, it will be demonstrated to program managers at DOE's Office of  Advanced Automotive Technologies.    The advisory committee, which meets bimonthly, consists of NREL (technical monitor), Texas Instruments, DaimlerChrysler, Ovonic Battery Company, SmartPower, and RM GmbH of Germany.     Converging high-tech information systems with vehicles    Terry Penney and Keith Wipke of CTTS participated in Convergence 2000, an  international congress on transportation electronics, Oct. 16-18, in Detroit, Mich., where they attended sessions as well as demonstrated ADVISOR at a booth hosted by MathWorks.  The theme of Convergence was ""automotive electronics: delivering technology's promises.""  The conference focused on the integration of advanced information technologies and the auto industry; attendees explored ways electronics could further enhance the capabilities of vehicles.   World renowned speakers included Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO, Sun Microsystems; Shoichiro Irimajiri, representative director and president, Sega Enterprises; Carly Fiorina, president and CEO, Hewlett-Packard; Michael Armstrong, chairman and CEO, AT&T; and William Ford, chairman of the board, Ford Motor Company.  Christine Sloane of General Motors and Thomas Gross of DOE led a technical session on electronics for hybrid electric vehicles produced with support from the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.   Of major interest were statements made by some of the key speakers:        In his banquet address, William Ford said, ""By 2010, 10-20% of all Ford vehicles sold will be hybrid vehicles and Ford will have hybrids for sale by 2003.""      The Sun CEO sees a day when every car or truck has its own Web site that tracks mileage, maintenance, and everything that is done on the vehicle throughout its life.    Bill Powers, vice president, Research Ford Motors, chaired a ""blue ribbon"" panel whose consensus said that there will be a dual voltage system (example 14/42) in more than one million production vehicles by 2010.  They also said that by 2010, there will be more than one million production vehicles classified as hybrids.        NGNGV Program launches into action    The  Next Generation Natural Gas Vehicle Program  will host its second meeting Nov. 7-8 in Dallas, Texas, for key stakeholders to decide upon important next steps, including vehicle technology development, program funding, and the communication and outreach plans.  In an effort to reduce oil imports, vehicle pollutants, and greenhouse gases, the program aims to develop two prototype natural gas vehicles by 2004.      Meeting looks into the future of communications    CTTS' Ann Brennan of the technology integration and utilization group attended the annual meeting of the Research Institute Publishing Executives, an organization of managers of information and communications divisions at not-for-profit research labs across the nation.  Members include several DOE labs, university-affiliated institutes, regional labs such as the Southwest Research Institute, and industry labs such as the Electric Power Research Institute.  Sessions focused on the latest trends at the labs in electronic, Web-based, and traditional print publishing, in addition to knowledge management.    Group explores ways to expand the use of alternative fuels     CTTS' Richard Parish of the Field Operations Program attended the Natural Gas Vehicle Infrastructure Working Group meeting in Las Vegas, Oct. 19 - 20.  The group discussed issues surrounding the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as transportation fuels and related technology improvements that need to occur for their wider use.   Representatives from utilities, automakers, equipment providers, the natural gas industry, national laboratories, and DOE participated.   Members of the group recognized the need to act quickly to enable and deploy CNG and LNG fueling stations to take advantage of the current interest in alternative fuels. As always, funding requirements for the necessary technical development are an issue.  Of note, some natural gas utilities are spinning off separate companies to build alternative fuel stations and are coordinating that effort with alternative fuel vehicle marketing in target areas.    CTTS meets with auto industry to discuss energy management strategies    A member of the vehicle auxiliary loads reduction team recently participated in a series of meetings with DaimlerChrysler and its suppliers to identify, optimize, and implement advanced climate control technologies that aim to reduce vehicle energy use and tailpipe emissions, while increasing the thermal comfort of passengers.                                      Visitors from Bangladesh learn about NREL's research    CTTS' Debbie Brodt-Giles joined a team of NREL hosts when several officials from the Bangladesh Ministry of Science and Technology visited the lab on Oct. 17.  Brodt-Giles provided an overview of CTTS work on advanced fuels and vehicles, and also took them for a ride in one of the lab's hybrid electric vehicles.

TRANSPORTATION ENERGY DATA BOOK: EDITION 23--2003   62  Alternative Fuels The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) defines alternative fuels as fuels which are substantially non-petroleum and yield energy security and environmental benefits. DOE currently recognizes the following as alternative fuels:        methanol and denatured ethanol as alcohol fuels (alcohol mixtures that contain no less than 70% of the alcohol fuel), natural gas (compressed or liquefied), liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal-derived liquid fuels fuels derived from biological materials, and electricity (including solar energy).  DOE has established the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) in support of its work aimed at fulfilling the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) directives. The AFDC is operated and managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. The purposes of the AFDC are:   to gather and analyze information on the fuel consumption, emissions, operation, and durability of alternative fuel vehicles, and to provide unbiased, accurate information on alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles to government agencies, private industry, research institutions, and other interested organizations.  The data are collected for three specific vehicle types: (1) light vehicles, including automobiles, light trucks, and mini-vans; (2) heavy vehicles such as tractor-trailers and garbage trucks; and (3) urban transit buses. Much of the AFDC data can be obtained through their web site: www.afdc.doe.gov. Several tables and graphs in this chapter contain statistics which were generated by the AFDC. DOE is sponsoring the National Alternative Fuels Hotline for Transportation Technologies in order to assist the general public and interested organizations in improving their understanding of alternative transportation fuels. The Hotline can be reached by dialing 1800-423-1DOE, or on the Internet at www.afdc.doe.gov/hotline.html.

The U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (composed of automakers Ford, General Motors, and DaimlerChrysler) began this effort in January 2002 with the long-term goal of developing technologies for hydrogenpowered fuel cell cars and trucks that will require no foreign oil and emit no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases. But, successful marketing of hydrogen cars may depend on the development of a hydrogen infrastructure, like today's petroleum infrastructure, at the same time automakers are perfecting hydrogen vehicles. That means the creation of everything from hydrogen manufacturing plants, to distribution and storage networks, to convenient hydrogen fueling stations. The FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiative is aimed at coordinating the efforts of the energy companies, automakers, utilities, state and local governments, foreign interests and other appropriate players. By working on parallel tracks, developing the hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure concurrently instead of consecutively, a decision to go forward with the commercialization of hydrogen automobiles could be made as early as 2015, 15 years ahead of current projections.

TRANSPORTATION ENERGY DATA BOOK: EDITION 23--2003   610  The relative efficiencies of seven different hydrogen production methods are summarized here as a result of research done by Argonne National Laboratory. The study indicates that:  Steam methane reforming is a very efficient and cost-effective way to manufacture hydrogen, but there are issues with natural gas supply and carbon sequestration.  Electrolysis is well understood but its overall efficiency depends largely on efficient electrical generation.  Thermochemical cycles have the potential to produce hydrogen from any high-temperature heat source with high efficiency in very high volumes. New research into lower-temperature cycles should increase the applicability of this method.

Keep up the good work, and of course, enjoy reading this issue of Alternative Fuel News.   Dan W. Reicher  Assistant Secretary  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy  U.S. Department of Energy         Cover Story     T he Clean Cities Corridor Connection   Since the Clean Cities Program's start-up 6 years ago, program participants have worked hard to develop local markets for alternative fuels. Stakeholders and partners in cities across the country have done much to ensure that alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) are available and the refueling and maintenance infrastructure is in place to support AFV use. Coalition members continue to reach out to local fleets, providing information about alternative fuel options and facilitating the AFV choice. The growing number of fleets using AFVs fosters the continued development of alternative refueling infrastructure, such that in many cities, fleets can now make a relatively seamless transition to alternative fuels. Individual Clean Cities serve as centers of AFV activity, but what happens when business stretches beyond those ""City Limits"" signs?    For many fleets, business is not limited to a particular city. Delivery service vehicles may have multiple stops in several cities within a region. Airports frequently service many metropolitan areas; shuttle customers need transportation to or from the airport to neighboring towns. So how does Clean Cities facilitate travel between various Clean Cities?   Many coalitions now work together to identify those fleets that use the interstate highways, so they can seek funding for shared refueling infrastructure projects along routes and further develop corridor links. Using Clean Cities as hubs, clean corridors can be created by enabling interstate and regional AFV travel to use a shared alternative fuel infrastructure. Clean corridors permit fleets that serve multiple cities to purchase AFVs with confidence, knowing that fueling convenience and supply will not be a problem.    One of the most successful corridors to date is the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC). Coordinated by Clean Cities consultants at Gladstein & Associates, the ICTC connects multiple Clean Cities in the West, including Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco in California; and Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. The ICTC focuses primarily on the commercial trucking industry, targeting heavy-duty truck fleets that use Interstate Highways 80, 5, 10, and 15, and CA-99, and promoting liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to diesel fuel. Over the past several years, the ICTC has been successful in offsetting the incremental costs for LNG trucks throughout the region and in developing a network of refueling stations along the highways that make up the corridor.    The ICTC has received considerable acclaim. When faced with the challenge of mitigating the environmental impacts of increased border traffic due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Texas General Land Office (GLO) looked to the ICTC as a model for clean corridor development. NAFTA relies heavily on trade routes between the United States and its neighbors, Mexico and Canada. These routes have dramatically increased the volume of traffic-particularly heavy-duty truck traffic-along the highways connecting the three countries. The increase of heavy-duty trucks has brought goods and also higher levels of emissions and air pollution. The GLO recognized the air quality impact NAFTA traffic was having on the state (which includes major border crossing points for trucks transporting goods to and from Mexico), and looked to alternative fuel use as a solution. The GLO began working with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Lone Star Energy's alternative fuels division, the U. S. Postal Service, local Clean Cities Coalitions, and the Environmental Protection Agency to identify opportunities to reduce emissions through the use of natural gas. Through this partnership, and working in conjunction with Gladstein & Associates, the International Clean Transportation Corridor-3 (ICTC-3) was born. ""The marriage of the Land Office corridor effort and the ICTC was a good one,"" said Elizabeth Munger, Director of the ICTC-3. ""We learned from the ICTC effort and took advantage of their experience."" The ICTC-3 serves all three countries (hence the name ICTC-3) and focuses specifically on the cities intersected by north-south routes I-35 and  I-29, and eventually I-94 (see map).    The long term goals for the corridor include linking I-35 with east-west route I-10, enabling AFV travel  from Houston, Texas, to Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona. Connections with I-40, and the cities of Oklahoma City,Oklahoma, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are also in the long term plan. When this effort is finished, the new corridor will link the ICTC-3 with its ""sister"" corridor in the west, the ICTC.   But for now, according to Munger, the primary objective of the ICTC-3 is education and outreach. ""We are facilitating a two-way exchange of information, so everyone involved knows what's going on in the cities along the corridor and can take advantage of the opportunities to work together,"" she said. The group, which includes Clean Cities coordinators and stakeholders from the Laredo, Houston, Alamo Area, Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Omaha, Red River Valley, and Winnipeg coalitions, meets regularly to discuss their current projects and progress.    Clean Cities members are currently focusing their corridor efforts to strengthen their locales as hubs for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. They are partnering on refueling infrastructure development projects and working to identify target fleets along corridor routes. ""The Clean Cities Program is the backbone of this effort,"" said Munger. ""So far, in each of the participating cities, a well-developed infrastructure for light-duty vehicles is beginning, but there hasn't been much of a concerted effort on the non-mandated vehicles. If we can strengthen the hubs, we can connect them with stations in between and build a corridor to support increased medium- and heavy-duty AFV traffic,"" she said.    The corridor partnerships have sparked new ideas and facilitated progress in many corridor hubs. According to coordinator Benjamin Watson, the Kansas City Regional Clean Cities Coalition (KCRCCC) reaped great benefits from the information exchange among the corridor cities. ""Last year we replicated work that was done in Oklahoma and were successful in getting alternative fuels legislation in Kansas and Missouri. This year we will be replicating the Dallas rebate project,"" he said.    The ICTC-3 also serves as the alternative fuels working group of North America's Superhighway Coalition (NASCO), an advocacy group promoting Interstate Highways 35, 29, and 94 as North America's International Trade Corridor. NASCO works to leverage funding to improve the highways and their infrastructure, and to add critical technologies along the corridor to facilitate trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Part of NASCO's mission is to mitigate the environmental impact of the increasing truck traffic along the highways as a result of NAFTA. In her role as director of the ICTC-3 and chair of the alternative fuels working group, Munger shares corridor project progress and success stories with NASCO. ""The most important thing we do is disperse information and help educate NASCO and the fleets that use the corridor, by showing them that alternative fuels are a real option, which provide both economic and environmental benefits,"" she said.    As more partnerships develop among Clean Cities coalitions, the network of alternative fuel infrastructure will expand. Clean corridors are making regional AFV travel a reality, and under the leadership of members from the ICTC, ICTC-3, and other corridor efforts, a closely knit national AFV network is on the way. For more information on clean corridors, please call the Clean Cities Hotline at 1-800-CCITIES.           Feature Story      I CTC-3 Supports Trade Mission to Mexico   The ICTC-3 announced that this spring, corridor members would lead a small, select group of AFV manufacturers and equipment suppliers to meet with fleet managers and trade association staff in Monterrey, Nuevo Len, Mexico. With ready access to major transportation routes, Monterrey is home to a large number of U.S.-operated plants, U.S. companies, and local companies, all of which depend on trucks to transport their goods. The purpose of the trade mission, which is sponsored by DOE, is to promote U.S. alternative fuel technologies to medium- and heavy-duty truck fleets. For more information, call Elizabeth Munger, Director, ICTC-3, at 512-447-3595, or e-mail her at  elizabeth@gladstein.org .    The ICTC corridor family is an example of a handful of corridor efforts, each in a different stage of development.     The Northeast Corridor runs along the East Coast, connecting Richmond, Virginia, with Boston, Massachusetts, along I-95.  The I-79 Corridor connects Charleston, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   The Clean Crossroads effort links several Midwestern Clean Cities, including Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Evansville and Indianapolis, Indiana.   The Colorado Front Range Corridor is another formalized effort among the Denver, Weld/Larimer/Rocky Mountain National Park, and Colorado Springs Clean Cities Coalitions, which is also working to connect with Clean Cities in Kansas and Missouri along I-70.   The Northwest Corridor serves I-5, connecting the Rogue Valley Clean Cities Coalition in Oregon with the Puget Sound Coalition based in Seattle, Washington. It extends north into Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The I-90 Corridor links several New York Clean Cities Coalitions, including Western New York, Genesee Region, Central New York, and Capital District.         F ederal News   DOE Supports USPS Commitments to Electric Vehicles    The United States Postal Service (USPS) recently ordered 500 electric delivery vehicles-the single largest purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) in U. S. history. Purchased through a competitive bid process from the Ford Motor Company, production will begin this fall. The vehicles will be assembled in Rome, New York. California will receive 480 of the vehicles, and the remainder will be located in Maryland.    ""The acquisition of these new vehicles once again reminds us of the pioneering role the Postal Service has played for over 200 years, utilizing innovation and technology in binding the nation together. Adopting this world-class technology benefits the Postal Service and the American people,"" said Postmaster General William J. Henderson. ""We deliver clean air along with the nation's mail. We're proud to be a good, environmental neighbor in every community we serve.""  Thanks to partnering efforts with the U. S. Department of Energy, the states of California and New York, the California Energy Commission, and several other environmental groups, these vehicles cost the USPS no more than the gasoline vehicles the USPS normally employs. The lead acid battery-powered EVs can be driven between 50 and 80 pollution-free miles before recharging. Acceleration is similar to their gasoline-powered counterparts, with the ability to go from 0-50 mph in 12.5 seconds.   The deployment of the first 500 vehicles will mean an annual reduction in tailpipe emissions of nearly 143,000 pounds of carbon monoxide, 11,000 pounds of hydrocarbons, and 16,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides. Since these vehicles run virtually pollution-free, the 500 vehicles, with an average of 500 deliveries per route, add up to more than a quarter million of pollution-free deliveries per day.   The USPS currently has the nation's largest compressed natural gas delivery fleet, with more than 7,500 vehicles. It recently purchased more than 21,000 flexible-fuel vehicles, which run on either gasoline or ethanol. By 2002, the USPS fleet of AFVs is expected to exceed 30,000.  Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson offered his con-gratulations to the Postal Service, saying the acquisition is "" a watershed for the use of electric vehicles in the United States.""    GAO Releases ""Glass Half-empty"" Transit Bus Report    In December 1999, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report on the status of alternative fuel use in transit bus fleets across the country. The report, which was mandated by the Transportation Equity Act of 1998 (TEA), was to review the types of alternative fuel bus technologies now in service and discuss the environmental and economic implications of their use.     A casual reader of the GAO report would conclude that alternative fuel buses are costly and not worth the effort. This is looking at the glass as ""half empty."" The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and many transit agencies look at the same data in a more positive light. With many of the early technical problems now solved, natural gas and other alternative fuel buses have a promising future.   The report contains some useful information and data within its charts and appendices; however, most of the discussion material is loosely based on informal conver-sations and interviews that the GAO had with a small industry group. Staff from only 12 transit agencies (out of hundreds in the country) were interviewed, and some of those agencies had only a few alternative fuel buses in their fleet (see table below). The GAO cited no specific scientific studies or in-depth analyses as the basis of the report, saying only that they had reviewed information from a variety of sources.              Not surprisingly, the report reveals that natural gas buses make up the majority of alternative fuel buses now in operation. Despite extensive communication with DOE and other industry groups, the report discloses little recent information. It also fails to address several critical issues that now drive the increased demand for alternative fuel buses.  Much of the report dwells on poor fleet experiences with early generation equipment from the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the findings do not reflect current market conditions.    Despite the ""glass half empty"" write up, an overview of the report's charts and appendices does show some positive alternative fuel trends that were not revealed in the GAO findings (see table below).   Most of the people interviewed for this report believe that environmental concerns are the main reason more alternative fuel buses are being used; the report states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ""receives more complaints from the public about emissions from transit buses than all other environmental issues combined."" Furthermore, the report claims that diesel buses have become significantly cleaner over the past 11 years, based on progressive tightening of emissions standards over that same period.    Unfortunately, this assessment neglects to consider that real world performance has not kept pace with emissions standards, as evidenced by the lawsuit filed by EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice last year against seven major heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers. The subsequent consent decree settlement (more than a billion dollars) clearly demonstrates that the engines on the road did not meet the published standards. According to an EPA spokesperson, ""The seven companies sold 1.3 million heavy-duty diesel engines containing illegal 'defeat devices,' which allow an engine to pass the EPA emissions test, but then turn off emission controls during highway driving. As a result, these engines emit up to three times the current (allowable) level for NOx, a harmful air pollutant."" These heavy-duty diesel engines emitted 1.3 million tons of excess NOx in 1998 alone, equivalent to the NO x  emissions from an additional 65 million cars being on the road, and representing 6% of the total NO x  emissions across the nation.    In addition, the report makes no mention of numerous recent studies and scientific findings concerning the health effects of exposure to diesel particulate matter. Such exposure is often worse in communities that rely heavily on public transit. Nor does the report address the impact that new regulations currently under consideration in California could have on the demand for alternative fuel buses.   On the capital expenditure side, there is no question that alternative fuel buses continue to carry a premium. However, based on the large number of new orders for natural gas buses, many transit agencies and their local communities apparently believe that the added expense is justified by the environmental and societal benefits  that the alternative fuel buses offer.   Check out  www.afdc.doe.gov/afv/buses.html  for the latest documentation on alternative fuel buses.

Nearly 20% of all new bus orders are now alternative fuel vehicles (primarily natural gas).  Half of all the agencies contacted by the GAO plan to continue buying alternative fuel buses; of those, all but one are buying 100% alternative fuel buses (i.e., not ordering any diesel buses).  Half of the CNG transit operators that were interviewed reported their fuel costs for CNG were equal to or less than their diesel costs would have been for the same period. (Note that this was before the steady price increases that diesel and gasoline are experiencing.) No mention was made of the anticipated price increases for low-sulfur diesel fuel necessary to achieve future emissions reductions in diesel engines.    DOE Makes Progress with State and Fuel Provider Enforcement    The State and Fuel Provider (S&FP) regulation went into effect in April 1996 (effective with the 1997 reporting year), in accordance with the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Under this program, which is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), state fleets and alternative fuel provider fleets are mandated to acquire a specific percentage of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as part of their regular annual light-duty vehicle acquisitions.  The S&FP Program requires fleets to report on the number of light-duty vehicle and AFV acquisitions for the year. Fleets earn credits for AFVs acquired in excess of their requirements, which can then be traded or sold to other fleets that were unable to meet their requirements through AFV purchases. This process provides key flexibility in the program and promotes both AFVs and sound business practices.   For model year 2000, which began September 1, 1999, between 50% and 90% of new light-duty vehicle acquisitions are required to be AFVs (the percentages vary depending on the type of fleet). Fleets covered by EPAct that do not comply with the requirements of the S&FP regulation are subject to fines of up to $50,000 per violation per day. As of January 2000, almost 90% of these fleets had complied.    Fleets reporting to DOE now have more than 35,000 AFVs on the road, with annual demand of at least 6,500 AFVs. Dana O'Hara, DOE's EPAct Team Leader, has high hopes for the program. ""We expect the number of AFVs in state and fuel provider fleets to keep increasing, in part because our enforcement strategy is flexible and fair,"" he said. Today more than 30 different models of AFVs are available from original equipment manufacturers, ranging from sedans and pickup trucks, to vans and minivans. Furthermore, due in part to this program, more refueling sites are available nationwide for fuels such as ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These options provide AFV users more flexibility and freedom. For example, ethanol stations have increased from two nationwide in 1992 to 49 in 1999. The network of CNG stations has grown from 349 to 1,267, and LPG refueling stations have increased from 3,297 to 4,153 over the same period.   Since the regulation passed, DOE's program team has spent most of its time organizing the implementation. Now that procedures and processes are in place, it will focus on increased outreach and enforcement.   For more information regarding the S&FP Program, log on to the Alternative Fuel Data Center Web site at www.afdc.doe.gov/fleet.shtml, call the regulatory information line at 202-586-9171, or send an e-mail to  regulatory_info@afdc.nrel.gov .         F ocus On   AFN Focus on the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition    Increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on the road and developing a network of refueling sites to support their use is no mean feat. It requires well-rounded coalitions that are effective in all aspects of the Clean Cities arena, including public outreach, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and legislative advocacy. Any of these  tasks may seem formidable, but the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition (SLCCC) and coordinator Beverly Miller makes it all look easy.   SLCCC has niche market projects (including several 100% alternative fuel fleets), airport initiatives, a technical training program, a renowned legislative effort, and a recognized public outreach program. The coalition recently received non-profit status. How do they do it all?  Miller says it's a combination of the right environment and stakeholder support that helps make it happen in Salt Lake City. ""Ultimately, every Clean Cities coalition is concerned with increasing the number of AFVs on the road and adding more refueling infrastructure,"" she added. ""We are fortunate to have wonderful fleets and strong support from our stakeholders.""    In addition to tactical project support, the Utah Office of Energy Services has made the full-time coordinator position possible through funding support, and the Salt Lake City Mayor's office provides Miller with a workplace and other amenities, including a computer, phone, and mailing services.   ""The availability of a full-time coordinator has been a vital element to their success,"" said DOE's Ernie Oakes, Clean Cities Program Manager for the Denver Region. Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition successes include more than 2,230 AFVs, already surpassing their original program plan goal for 2000. Many of these vehicles operate in niche market fleets that are highly visible to the community.   The Newspaper Agency, responsible for delivering the area's two major newspapers-the Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News-is a classic example of a successful niche market AFV fleet. According to Miller, after researching its options, The Newspaper Agency staff decided AFVs would be a good way to give something back to the community. Today it operates a nearly 100% alternative fuel fleet. All 230 of its vans, which travel six million miles a year, run on CNG and are saving the company thousands of dollars in fuel costs. ""The Newspaper Agency is absolutely committed,"" said Miller. ""It's their passion for alternative fuels that has made them so successful.""    Another delivery fleet, Flower Patch, Inc., a floral delivery service, is also operating its entire fleet (18 vehicles) on natural gas. The Jordan School District added seven natural gas buses in 1999, bringing its total AFV fleet to almost 30. The city-owned airport, whose fleet includes many heavy-duty snow removal vehicles and buses, is 26% alternative fueled, and that percentage is steadily climbing. The coalition, which intends to make Salt Lake International Airport ""the greenest airport in the country,"" has developed an AFV strategic plan to be implemented this year. SLCCC is also working with independently owned shuttle companies that service the airport to facilitate their transition to alternative fuels.    Among the stakeholders at the helm of SLCCC's niche market effort is a local vehicle dealership. A representative from Hinckley Dodge is working with several area shuttles that serve handicapped and disabled people to transition their vehicles to AFVs. ""It's been the most focused and most aggressive effort I've ever seen,"" said Miller.    The thousands of AFVs traveling the area's roads would not be possible, however, without the strong support of fuel providers like Utah's Questar Gas. Miller calls Questar Gas ""simply fantastic."" Not only does its fleet include more than 800 AFVs, but the company has also helped develop an extensive refueling infrastructure network that includes more than 60 natural gas stations. In partnership with the state of Utah, most of the region's refueling sites are now publicly accessible with a common gas credit card. ""GasCard expanded the number of publicly accessible sites from 20 to 32,"" said Miller. ""The stations are easily accessible and near interstate highways, which helps create an environment attractive to fleets,"" she said.   The coalition, which recently received non-profit status, also assists area fleets with fund-raising to support AFV purchases. Last year, SLCCC was awarded three DOE State Energy Program Special Projects grants totaling $314,421. The funds will support the school bus fleet, a delivery fleet, and a publicly accessible refueling station at the airport. The coalition also received $25,000 through DOE's Clean Cities Rebate Program to create an AFV reimbursement fund for coalition stakeholders. The Propane Education and Research Council also awarded the coalition a grant to support The Newspaper Agency's purchase.   SLCCC is active in public outreach as well. The Newspaper Agency, which co-chairs the coalition's public awareness committee, helped develop several projects. In partnership with the National Energy Foundation, they created two newspaper supplements. The first insert was a resource guide with information on alternative fuels and Clean Cities for the elementary and middle school students participating in Utah's ninth annual energy debate. More than 375,000 copies were printed; half were distributed to schools in response to specific requests. The second newspaper insert corresponded to the opening of TRAX, the area's new light rail system, and featured information on alternative transportation systems, as well as the Clean Cities Program. The coalition is currently planning a third supplement on land use issues, which will highlight AFVs and transportation planning.    Also included in Salt Lake's outreach activities is its technician-training program. The coalition developed a program that is offered without charge to technicians representing local entities with AFVs.    It might seem the vehicle, station, fleet recruitment, fundraising, and public outreach activities would be enough to keep the Salt Lake coalition busy. However, Miller and other stakeholders have also developed a legislative plan. ""I feel strongly about the importance of people directly involving themselves in the political process,"" said Miller. ""There isn't anything more American than calling your legislator and voicing your opinion."" The coalition has developed a relationship with local and national legislators and regularly informs them of its activities and successes. While in Washington, D.C., at the Fourth National Clean Cities Conference, Miller and several other SLCCC stakeholders made a trip to Capitol Hill and visited with staff members of every congressional representative for the state of Utah. ""It's important to work with the staff,"" said Miller. ""They can help you, or they can shut you out."" Perhaps it is no coincidence that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was a co-sponsor of The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act (S. 1003), introduced in 1999, and has announced his support for alternative fuels in numerous forums.    Utah legislators are also helping the SLCCC. As a result of the relationships SLCCC stakeholders have developed, staffers now seek their opinion. ""Voters don't typically make phone calls, but when you make yourself known, others will follow,"" Miller said. The coalition's legislative momentum will continue through the 2000 legislative session. Stakeholders have drafted AFV legislation they hope will be introduced. In the spirit of what Miller calls ""grassroots advocacy,"" several private sector coalition members are working with a lobbyist to help them with the information-and the courage-they need to call their elected officials and put in a good word.  According to Miller, effective outreach and constant customer interaction help create a favorable environment for AFVs. ""If you do something long enough, if you have a constant presence and never forget your message, you'll begin to see some activity,"" she said. A strong core of support is also essential for success. ""I really believe this is a full-time job,"" said Miller. ""At the least, you have to get people involved. I am deeply indebted to about a half-dozen, results-oriented people. You don't need many, but with a core group you can really make things happenjust find two or three things that you can feel good about so you can advertise your success,"" she said. The SLCCC Board of Trustees meets regularly, as do most of the coalition's working groups.    In addition to stakeholder involvement, remembering ""the basics"" is also critical to maintaining coalition support. ""It's also important to thank people,"" Miller added. ""You have to bring people in, make them feel good about what they're doing, and let them know you appreciate their efforts.""    Salt Lake Clean Cities continues to be a leader in all aspects of alternative fuel market development. Thank you, Beverly Miller and the Salt Lake Clean Cities Coalition, for setting an outstanding example.         C lean Cities Roundup   Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition Celebrates Purchase of 40 AFVs    Before kicking off its millennium festivities, the Greater Long Island Clean Cities Coalition (GLICCC) hosted a different kind of celebration. Together with the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Boston Regional Office, coalition stakeholders, including KeySpan Energy, DOE's Clean Cities Program, Suffolk County, and Ford Motor Company, celebrated the purchase of 40 natural gas vehicles by Arrow Security, a private security firm based on Long Island. The purchase, recognized as the largest single acquisition of natural gas vehicles by a private fleet in New York state, was made possible by funding and technical assistance from the GLICCC, KeySpan Energy, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and the DOE Clean Cities Rebate program. GLICCC and KeySpan Energy leveraged $275,000 in public and private financing to help offset the capital costs of the project. For more information, call Mike Scarpino, U.S. DOE, Boston Regional Office, at 617-565-9716.    Connecticut Subway Restaurants Now Offer More than Just Sandwiches    Now many Connecticut residents can do more than get a sandwich and chips at the local Subway. The Subway shops of Fairfield County have committed to a partnership with Clean Cities Energy Alternatives of Southwestern Connecticut (formerly Norwalk Clean Cities). Subway has positioned itself as the ""Smart Alternative,"" to fast food, a strategy that the company sees as a perfect fit with the local Clean Cities effort.    In the spirit of healthy living, Subway management has offered its locations as designated sign-up spots for individuals or companies. People who are interested in joining the local Clean Cities coalition can sign up while they lunch at a Fairfield County Subway shop, using coalition membership applications that are available at each cash register. In turn, Subway will have an ad on the application directing companies and /or individuals to the coalition's Web site . Visitors to the Web site can download a coupon for Subway sandwiches, which is valid at a participating store in the Fairfield County area.    Depending on the success of the pilot program, local board chairman James Hansen will present the idea to Subway's national board to implement nationwide.        F rom the Automakers   Auto Show Attendees Get a Glimpse of Future Concept Cars    Winter isn't only a season of cold weather, snow, and holiday fun. For many in the transportation industry, it's also the auto show season. In Tokyo and Detroit, automakers impressed audiences, who were anxious to catch a glimpse of the vehicles for the new millennium. Hybrid electric and fuel cell concept vehicles drew much of the attention, as environmentally friendly transportation is a growing concern among consumers. Ford and General Motors (GM) unveiled their hybrid vehicles developed with the help of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). The new energy efficient hybrids, still under development, boast fuel economies of 80, 90, and even 100 miles per gallon (mpg). Below are a few of the vehicles showcased last fall in Tokyo and at the North American International Auto Show held in January 2000. Although most are still concepts and do not compete directly with today's alternative fuel vehicles, these hybrid-electric and fuel cell technologies forecast an exciting future for drivers everywhere.    Ford Prodigy     On the outside, the Ford Prodigy looks very similar to the conventional model year 2000 vehicles. What's on the inside, however, is a much different story. The Prodigy, a hybrid-electric concept vehicle designed to be a family sedan, uses a propulsion system with drive units on both axles. An experimental four-cylinder, 1.2 liter diesel engine, and an electric drive motor enable fuel economy of 80 mpg with diesel fuel (the equivalent of 70 mpg in a gasoline vehicle). Made almost entirely of aluminum, the Prodigy is extremely light and aerodynamic; rear-facing cameras replace traditional side view mirrors to reduce drag. But even though Ford uses the latest technology, it has not lost its focus on practicality. Unlike many other hybrid-electric concepts, the Prodigy has a usable trunk.    Honda Insight and FCX    Honda's hybrid-electric Insight needed no introduction, as it was among the first hybrid vehicles to be officially unveiled last year (and it was also showcased at the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in June 1999). In addition to highlighting the Insight, Honda unveiled its latest advanced technology concept vehicle, the FCX, at the  auto show in Detroit. The FCX is a fuel cell prototype sedan that Honda plans to have on the road by 2003. The prototype models include both hydrogen- and methanol-based systems.    GM's Precept and Chevrolet Triax    General Motors (GM) is also working on two new hybrid concepts-the GM Precept and the Chevrolet Triax. The Precept is among the world's most energy efficient vehicles; it can attain 90 miles per diesel gallon (80 mpg gasoline) equivalent. GM unveiled the sleek, aerodynamic hybrid-electric concept vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Precept features a dual-axle regenerative hybrid propulsion system that combines electric and either gasoline or diesel engine systems. The fuel cell version of the Precept also made its debut in Detroit. It uses a hydrogen hydride storage system, which GM boasts will attain 108-mpg equivalent and up to 500 miles in range.    The Chevrolet Triax, featured at the Tokyo and North American International Auto Shows, is a sharply angled and highly versatile hybrid vehicle that can be produced with one of three powertrains-4WD electric, 2WD gasoline, or 4WD gasoline-electric hybrid. Customers will be able to select the type of powertrain that best meets their needs. In its hybrid form, the Triax has an electric motor that powers the front wheels and captures regenerative braking energy to recharge the battery. A gasoline engine drives the rear wheels, and a second electric motor captures the regenerative braking energy from the rear wheels and starts the engine.    Toyota's HV-M4    Although Toyota showcased its highly popular hybrid, the Prius, in Detroit, the company unveiled its newest hybrid concept vehicle-the HV-M4- at the Tokyo Auto Show last fall. The HV-M4, the world's first hybrid-electric 4WD minivan, is powered by a 2.4 liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the back wheels. The HV-M4 is reported to meet Japan's soon-to-be toughest emissions standards, J-ULEV. With room for six and its own mobile power station (internal and external electric sockets that can power a microwave or television without extra charging), the HV-M4 will be an exciting entry into the hybrid world.   Look for coverage of DaimlerChrysler's new hybrid, the Dodge ESX3, in upcoming issues of AFN.         N uts and Bolts   DOE Awards Alternative Fuel Grants to 33 National Parks    On December 6, 1999, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Bill Richardson and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced almost $500,000 in Clean Energy Awards to selected national park fleet managers. These awards are the first for the Green Energy Parks Program.   Thirty-three national parks will benefit from the grants, made possible through DOE funds. The money will support the enhanced use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in the National Park System. Anticipated projects include building new refueling stations, buying more AFVs, and evaluating emerging engine and fuel system technologies for use in the parks. The Green Energy Parks Program continues this year, with another round of project developments already under way.   Check out   www.eren.doe.gov/femp/techassist/greenparks.html  for information about the types of AFVs and fuels being used in the National Park System.   The following parks received funding through the Green Energy Parks Program:    Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona   Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas   Channel Islands National Park, California  Joshua Tree National Park, California  Whiskeytown Shasta Trinity, California  National Recreation Area, California  Yosemite National Park, California  Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado   National Capital Region, District of Columbia  Everglades National Park, Florida  Chattahoochee National Scenic River, Georgia  Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii  Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Indiana   Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky   Assateague Island National Seashore, Maryland   Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts  Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan  Sleeping Bears Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan   Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota  Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, Missouri   Scott's Bluff National Monument, Nebraska   Cuyahoga River National Recreation Area, Ohio  Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, Ohio  Fort Union National Monument, New Mexico  Gettysburg National Military Park, Pennsylvania  Fort Sumter National Monument, South Carolina  Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota  San Antonio Missions National Historic Park, Texas  Marsh-Billings National Historic Park, Vermont   George Washington Memorial Parkway, Virginia   Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, Washington  Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming  Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming    NAFTC Names New Executive Director    The National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) recently announced the appointment of Al Ebron as its new executive director. Ebron, formerly Alternative Fuels Program Manager for the state of North Carolina, brings extensive experience in alternative fuels to this position at NAFTC. The consortium, headquartered in Morgantown, West Virginia at West Virginia University, is the nation's leading supplier of alternative fuels systems training and education.        H ot off the Press   EPAct Report Evaluates Progress    The U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Technology Utilization has recently issued the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) Section 506 report. The report evaluates progress made in achieving the fuel displacement goals described in EPAct, the actual and potential role of replacement fuels and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in significantly reducing U.S. reliance on imported oil, and the actual and potential availability of various domestic replacement fuels and AFVs.  The considerable experience gained from vehicle operation that was mandated by EPAct and related DOE research and development efforts helped determine the following conclusions about transportation replacement fuels:    The technical barriers to the use of alternative and replacement fuels can be overcome.  Many people who own vehicles find the performance of flexible and alternative fuel vehicles acceptable.   The 10/30 replacement fuel goals cannot be met, given today's petroleum product prices and the limited federal authority to promote or require the use of replacement fuels. DOE, as part of its EPAct rulemaking to determine if private and local fleets should be required to purchase AFVs, will determine whether the goals should be modified, given the current market conditions.  The public policy goals served by the increased use of alternative and replacement fuels remain strong in terms of reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil price shocks, decreasing emissions of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing criteria pollutants, and promoting the development of the domestic economy.  It would be prudent for DOE and interested committees of Congress to begin discussions now on additional programs and authorities that would contribute to reaching EPAct goals.   The report, entitled ""Replacement Fuel and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Technical and Policy Analysis,"" was finalized in April 2000 and transmitted to the President and Congress. Copies of the report can be viewed and printed from the ""Regulations and Legislative Activities"" section of DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies Web site at  www.ott.doe.gov  as soon as it is available. Printed copies will also be available by calling the Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1363.         O n the Web   Information about Alternatives    The Natural Resources Defense Council recently launched a Web site intended to educate the public about alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Once educated, the council hopes more people will make the change to environmentally friendly cars. Visit the Web site  www.nrdc.org/ .

GX254-96-1896779	"OLR Bill Analysis    sSB 1068    AN ACT ENABLING THE STATE TO PROVIDE A TAX-FREE COMMUTING INCENTIVE.    SUMMARY :    This bill permits the comptroller to offer qualified state employees and members of the General Assembly the option of excluding certain commuting costs from their taxable wages.  The comptroller's actions must be consistent with the Internal Revenue Code.      The comptroller may hire a contractor to manage the program.          EFFECTIVE DATE:  October 1, 2001      COMMUTING COSTS    Commuting costs are those incurred (1) through transportation in a ""commuter highway vehicle"" if it is connected with travel between the employee's home and work site, (2) for a transit pass, or (3) for ""qualified parking.""      The Internal Revenue Code defines ""commuter highway vehicle,"" ""transit pass,"" and ""qualified parking"" (26 USC 132(f)).       A commuter highway vehicle is one that seats at least six adults (excluding the driver) and is reasonably expected to be used for transporting employees to and from work on trips with at least one-half of the seats (excluding the driver) filled for at least 80% of the vehicle's mileage for a year.         A transit pass is any pass, token, farecard, voucher, or similar item entitling a person to ride on mass transit or a commuter highway vehicle.       Qualified parking is employer-provided parking at or near an employee's work or at a location from which the employee commutes by transit pass, commuter highway vehicle, or carpool.  An employer provides parking if it pays for the parking or reimburses the employee for parking expenses or the parking is on property that the employer owns or leases.         The comptroller cannot withhold more than the Internal Revenue Code's maximum level.  The current limit is $65 per month for commuter highway vehicle and transit pass costs and $180 per month for qualified parking costs.         BACKGROUND    Federal Law    The Internal Revenue Code excludes certain fringe benefits from gross income.  Income that constitutes a ""qualified transportation fringe"" is excludable.  A ""qualified transportation fringe"" is any of the following an employer provides to an employee: (1) transportation in a commuter highway vehicle that is in connection with travel between the employee's home and work, (2) any transit pass, or (3) qualified parking (26 USC 132(a)).

Hybrid electric vehicles combine                    the best features of internal combustion engines  (1)                     and electric motors  (3) .                                             In              the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius both the engine  (1)  and              the electric motor  (3)  are connected to the wheels by the same              transmission  (2).   With the assistance of the electric motor              the engine can be smaller.                Intelligent                power electronics  (4)  decide when to use the motor and engine                and when to store electricity in advanced batteries  (6)  for                future use. The electric motor is used primarily for low speed cruising                or to provide extra power for acceleration or hill climbing.               When                braking or coasting to a stop, the hybrid uses its electric motor                 (3)  as a generator to produce electricity, which is then                stored in its battery pack  (6) .               Unlike                all-electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles do not need to be plugged                into an external source of electricity. Gasoline stored in a conventional                fuel tank  (5)  provides all the energy the hybrid vehicle                needs.               Three                hybrid vehicles are currently available:                               Toyota                  Prius                 Honda                  Insight                 Honda Civic(hybrid)                                               For                fuel economy information on these vehicles, please visit the  Find                and Compare Cars Section.

October 29, 2003      News and Events       DOE and EPA Announce the Fuel Economy Leaders for Model Year 2004    Japanese Automakers Look to the Future at Tokyo Auto Show    Fourteen of 22 Cars Complete the World Solar Challenge    Big Wind Energy Projects Hit the Great Plains    USDA and Rural Electric Coops to Advance Energy Efficiency, Renewables    St. Lawrence Hydropower Station Earns New 50-Year License         Energy Connections       EIA: U.S. Energy Use Increased 1 Percent in 2002              News and Events    DOE and EPA Announce the Fuel Economy Leaders for Model Year 2004   DOE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the latest edition of the Web-based ""Fuel Economy Guide"" on October 23rd. The latest edition of the guide includes fuel economy, emissions, and safety data for all model year 2004 vehicles sold in the United States. It also includes fuel-saving tips and additional information on advanced-technology vehicles, including hybrid electric, alternative fuel, and fuel cell vehicles. See the  Fuel Economy Guide .   For the fourth year in a row, hybrid electric vehicles are at the top of the fuel efficiency list, and with the new, larger Toyota Prius, hybrids also lead three vehicle classes: the Honda Insight leads the two-seaters, the Honda Civic Hybrid leads the compact cars, and the Toyota Prius leads the midsize cars. The bottom of the list is mostly dominated by the Italian sports cars-Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Maserati-with one domestic entry: the four-wheel-drive Ford F150 pickup. See the  DOE  and  EPA  press releases.   Although the Honda Insight remains at the top of the list, its impact on the total U.S. fleet of vehicles is negligible, since Honda has sold only 1,036 of the vehicles this year. Honda's sales of the Civic Hybrid are much greater: 13,707 vehicles in 2002, and 17,177 through the end of September this year. However, the new Toyota Prius may dwarf those numbers, as Toyota plans to produce 36,000 Prius vehicles for the U.S. market in 2004. See the  Honda  and  Toyota  press releases.    Japanese Automakers Look to the Future at Tokyo Auto Show   While Honda and Toyota currently lead the world in the production of hybrid electric vehicles with high fuel efficiencies, their concept vehicles at the Tokyo Auto Show-now underway and continuing through November 5th-suggest an intent to use hybrid technology for more high-powered performance in the future. Toyota stands out with its Lexus ""LF-S,"" a sedan powered by a hybrid electric V8 engine; its ""SU-HV1,"" a sport utility vehicle that combines a 3.3-liter V6 engine with a 120-kilowatt motor, boosted by a 50-kilowatt motor on the rear axle; and its ""CS&S,"" a sports car that marries a 1.5-liter engine to a 50-kilowatt motor, with another motor mounted on the front axle. Toyota's CS&S aims to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 8.6 seconds while achieving a fuel economy of nearly 78 miles per gallon. Toyota is also displaying the ""Fine-N,"" a fuel cell car that uses four 25-kilowatt wheel-mounted motors. See the press releases, images, videos, and detailed information on  Toyota's Tokyo Auto Show Web site .   Honda brought its own vision of high-performance hybrid technology to the Tokyo Auto Show. The ""IMAS,"" which looks like a Honda Insight on steroids, incorporates Honda's newest hybrid power system into a carbon-bodied two-seater that weighs slightly more than 1,500 pounds. Honda estimates the vehicle would achieve more than 94 miles to the gallon. Honda also introduced the ""ASM,"" a hybrid electric minivan, and the fuel-cell-powered ""KIWAMI,"" a wedge-shaped sedan that uses an ultracapacitor for energy storage. See  Honda's Tokyo Auto Show Web site .   Meanwhile, Daihatsu and Subaru are threatening to topple the Honda and Toyota hybrid electric dynasty. Daihatsu debuted the ""UFE-II,"" a four-seat hybrid that looks like an Insight, weighs less than 1,300 pounds, and achieves the lowest aerodynamic drag yet (0.19), all of which yields an astounding 140 miles per gallon. Subaru unveiled the ""B9 Scrambler""-a two-seat sports car featuring its new hybrid power system-and the all-electric ""R1e"" mini-car. See the  Daihatsu press release  and  Subaru's Tokyo Auto Show Web site .   Other Japanese automakers focused mainly on fuel cell vehicles and advanced internal-combustion engines. Nissan unveiled its ""EFFIS"" fuel cell car, which uses a lithium-ion battery and an efficient motor with two output shafts that can be controlled independently. Mitsubishi brought its new fuel cell vehicle to the show, and also introduced the ""i,"" a small, lightweight car that uses an advanced gasoline engine to achieve low emissions and a fuel economy of 62 miles per gallon. And Mazda debuted the ""RX-8 Hydrogen RE,"" which features a rotary engine that burns hydrogen. See the press releases from  Nissan ,  Mitsubishi , and  Mazda .    Fourteen of 22 Cars Complete the World Solar Challenge   The World Solar Challenge ended on October 28th in Australia, and 14 of the 22 cars that entered the race reached the finish line near Adelaide under their own power. For the leaders, the race was over six days earlier: the Nuon Solar Team from the Netherlands finished the course on the afternoon of October 22nd, winning the race with an average speed of about 60 miles per hour. The second-place team-from Melbourne, Australia-reached the finish line an hour and forty-three minutes behind the Dutch team. A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology came in third, finishing early in the morning on October 23rd. Three other vehicles finished that day, followed by three more on the 24th, two more on the 25th, two on the 26th, and a final straggler on October 28th. The final team—the Heliodet team from Germany—has entered each of the seven World Solar Challenges, and was successful in crossing the finish line for the first time this year. The World Solar Challenge is a grueling course, stretching nearly 1,900 miles down the center of the Australian continent. See the "" Latest Updates "" and "" Media "" pages on the World Solar Challenge Web site.   The Nuon Solar Team earned its second consecutive win at the World Solar Challenge-and achieved its second consecutive world-record speed-by relying heavily on technology developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). The team's vehicle, the Nuna II, used 3,000 triple-junction gallium-arsenide solar cells, which convert more than 24.5 percent of the sunlight that hits them into electricity. The craft also featured 46 lithium-ion batteries (providing five kilowatt- hours of electrical energy storage), an advanced aerodynamic shape, and a carbon-fiber body reinforced with a plastic called aramide, which is used in space suits for protection against micrometeorites. See the  ESA press release .    Big Wind Energy Projects Hit the Great Plains   New wind power plants went online in October in the Great Plains states of North and South Dakota-the first large wind facilities in those states-while construction began on a new large wind plant on the plains of eastern Colorado.   Both North and South Dakota gained 40 megawatts of wind power as FPL Energy completed the North Dakota I Wind Energy Center and the South Dakota Wind Energy Center in the first half of October. Basin Electric Power Cooperative is buying all the power from the two sites, each of which draws on 27 1.5-megawatt wind turbines manufactured by GE Wind Energy. In late October, FPL Energy completed its second wind project in North Dakota, the North Dakota II Wind Energy Center, a 21-megawatt project that will provide power to the Otter Tail Power Company. The facility consists of 14 of the 1.5-megawatt GE Wind Energy turbines. See the  October 6th  and  October 14th  press releases from Basin Electric, as well as the  Otter Tail Power Company press release .   The Colorado plains will soon host the state's largest wind power plant, a 162-megawatt facility near Lamar, about 100 miles east of Pueblo. PPM Energy, Inc. and Shell WindEnergy, Inc. are building the Colorado Green Wind Project using-you guessed it-108 1.5-megawatt wind turbines from GE Wind Energy. Xcel Energy is buying all the power produced by the new facility, which should be complete by year-end. See the  PPM Energy press release .   PPM Energy is active in California, as well: the company is building the 22-megawatt Mountain View III wind facility in Riverside County, near the Arizona border. FPL Energy is also gaining more wind energy assets in California, but is buying rather than building them: the company is acquiring 130 megawatts of wind power capacity that is currently owned by Enron. The $80-million deal is subject to regulatory approval and acceptance at a bankruptcy auction, scheduled for early December. See the  PPM Energy  and  FPL Energy  press releases.    USDA and Rural Electric Coops to Advance Energy Efficiency, Renewables   The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) signed an agreement with rural electric cooperatives on October 22nd to increase the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in rural areas by removing technical and market barriers. The USDA signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) to identify cost-effective, voluntary opportunities for rural electric cooperatives to partner with farmers and ranchers to reduce greenhouse gases. The agreement includes—but is not limited to—the use of renewable energy, energy efficiency, fuel cells, microturbines, and biobased products. The agreement identifies areas for public-private cooperation in research, standards development, and education. See the  USDA press release .   The agreement also calls for NRECA to assist member cooperatives toward a goal of increased use of renewable power technologies, including biomass co-fired power plants, biomass gasification power plants, animal waste-to-energy projects, landfill-methane power projects, and wind and solar energy. NRECA will also support the development of industry standards for the interconnection of distributed power sources to the electrical grid. See the full agreement, posted on the NRECA Web site ( PDF 747 KB ).  Download Acrobat Reader .    St. Lawrence Hydropower Station Earns New 50-Year License   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a new 50-year operating license to the 912-megawatt St. Lawrence-FDR hydropower project on October 22nd. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) owns the project, located on the St. Lawrence River near Massena, New York. The project regulates the water levels in Lake Ontario by controlling its flow to the Atlantic Ocean. It has been producing power since 1958.   The relicensing of the facility involved a complicated settlement agreement among Native Americans, conservation groups, and local, state, and federal officials from both the United States and Canada. It includes a $24 million fund for fish enhancement and mitigation and the construction of a fish ladder to assist the upstream passage of the American eel. See the  FERC press release .   New York Governor George E. Pataki lauded the new license, which NYPA applied for two years ago. The original license was due to expire in October. Although the St. Lawrence project is aging, NYPA is currently spending more than $254 million on a 15-year modernization and upgrade for the project's turbine generators. NYPA aims to complete the upgrade in 2013. See the  governor's press release .    Energy Connections    EIA: U.S. Energy Use Increased 1 Percent in 2002   U.S. energy use held nearly steady in 2002, according to a new report by DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). U.S. energy use increased about 1 percent above 2001 levels, but is still 1.4 percent lower than the energy consumption in 2000 and only 0.6 percent greater than 1999 consumption levels. By sector, the trends in energy use reflect trends in the U.S. economy as a whole, with residential energy use increasing 3.4 percent and accounting for most of the overall increase. In contrast, the use of energy for transportation increased 0.9 percent, commercial energy use increased 0.5 percent, and industrial energy use increased only 0.02 percent. The energy intensity of the economy-measured in energy use per dollar of gross domestic product-continued its downward trend, and is now at 10.31 thousand Btu (British thermal units) per dollar, adjusted to 1996 dollars. A decrease in energy intensity suggests that the U.S. economy is using energy more efficiently.   As already noted in EIA's Renewable Trends Report, issued in late August, the use of renewable energy increased about 10.8 percent in 2002, due largely to a 21.2 percent increase in hydropower production as the West bounced back from the 2001 drought. Wind power experienced the fastest growth of all renewable technologies, increasing nearly 59 percent over 2001 levels.

DOE Seeks Input on E85 Action Plan  Inside:   L  iving in Washington, DC, it seems like each week brings a new, major question, challenge, or problem for the President, Congress, or the ""American people"" to address, debate, or solve. Skimming through the newspaper reveals the need to revise the tax code, balance the budget, and improve health care. There is a challenge for better logging practices in the rain forests, and just what's going to happen in Iraq? Although this may be an intellectually stimulating environment, all too often there is little that we as individuals have the power to influence. Well, that's not the case with the climate change issue, which splashed across every newspaper and magazine during December and January. Climate change is our issue. This is something we can influence. Here is a place where we can make a difference. I think our cover story headline hits the nail on the head in stating, ""Historic Kyoto Protocol Presents Opportunities for Cleaner Transportation Technologies."" Right now in the 60 Clean Cities, you are working on a solution by promoting and using alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). And, maybe more importantly, you are setting the stage to introduce the advanced technology vehicles of the next generation. Our feature story, on new plans for E85 infrastructure, is a perfect example of how the hard work in and around Clean Cities can directly affect the ""global challenge"" of climate change. By building new ethanol refueling infrastructures, we can facilitate the use of more 85% ethanol fuel. The use of domestically produced renewable ethanol for E85 production significantly reduces tailpipe emissions that cause ozone and carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. You may have noticed that Lee Slezak's signature is missing this month. Lee has moved over to our vehicle testing and evaluation division here at DOE, where he will manage the advanced vehicle testing and field operations programs. Although he'll be missed at the Alternative Fuels Data Center, we'll soon be hearing special reports from him on the real-world characteristics and performance of advanced technology vehicles that will be in showrooms early in the next century. The Data Center will also undergo a bit of an organizational facelift. Cindy Riley from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (303-275-4491) has assumed the management responsibilities, and she is planning an exciting new portfolio of informational materials and ""tools"" to help influence the choice for AFVs. Lastly, Clara Chun from our Oakland office will be moving on in her career. Many of you know her from her work in California, but Clara has also been an instrumental and critical part of the National Clean Cities Team for more than 3 years now. Although I wish her well, she will be dearly missed. Fortunately, Ernie Rios (510-637-1950), a 10-year veteran of DOE and former director of the old San Francisco Regional Support Office, will take over the reins. So, as you can see, we're already off to an eventful and exciting year! As usual, enjoy the issue.

BR-425-23470 March 1998  Printed with a renewable-source ink on paper containing at least 50% wastepaper, including 20% postconsumer waste  2   Historic Kyoto Protocol Presents Opportunities for Cleaner Transportation Technologies Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions present new opportunities for the alternative transportation fuels industry. Responding to the vast majority of the world's climate scientists who believe human activities (primarily burning fossil fuels) are adversely influencing global climate, 160 nations recently reached a historic agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by harnessing the forces of the global marketplace to protect the environment. ""[The Kyoto Protocol] is environmentally strong and economically sound.... I am particularly pleased that it strongly reflects the commitment of the United States to use the tools of the free market to tackle this difficult problem,"" President Clinton stated. ""I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, and energy-efficient homes. "" President Clinton, State of the Union  Because transportation is the second largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and is projected to be the largest source by the year 2000 (according to the Energy Information Administration), transportation industries will have a critical role to play in helping the nation reach the U.S. emissions reduction targets. General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler recently demonstrated their understanding of the significance of the Protocol as they unveiled concept designs for cleaner vehicles and showcased how U.S. industry can find practical solutions to this problem (see From the Automakers). In response, Vice President Gore applauded the Big Three for ""introducing a new generation of highly efficient cars that will meet the needs of America's families while also meeting the challenge of global warming. It shows that through ingenuity and inno""In light of the Kyoto agreement, vation, American industry can dramatically reduce greensuch advanced vehicles will play an house gas pollution while strengthening our economy and even more important role in meeting creating new jobs."" national environmental goals while Most importantly, the alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) built preserving U.S. jobs. "" by automakers today and already operating in Clean Cities, Dan Reicher, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, U.S. DOE  can also help address climate change. Automakers and fuel suppliers that are helping meet the nation's urban air quality and energy security goals can now market AFVs as part of the nation's climate change strategy.  More than 200,000 AFVs are on the road in the 60 U.S. communities participating in DOE's Clean Cities Program. Each vehicle fuel technology--ethanol, natural gas, propane, electric, and others--can provide net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, technology and fuel suppliers are learning how to measure and communicate these benefits to customers using AFVs, and create the necessary foundation to develop future markets for high fuel efficiency and advanced ""We can help tackle this probtechnology vehicles. lem now with the alternative In addition, policy developments on the horizon can be expected to increase business opportunities for cleaner transportation technologies and alternative fuels.

"" David Rodgers, Director Office of Technology Utilization, U.S. DOE  In the future, the President's proposal for domestic greenhouse gas emissions trading (modeled after the Clean Air Act's highly successful utility acid rain trading program) could bring new investments in advanced transportation technologies.

While policies unfold, the scientific need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will remain, as will the challenges and opportunities this issue presents for clean energy and transportation technologies.  3   Federal News Comments Welcome on the Rulemaking for Local Government and Private Fleets If fleet managers want to convert their delivery fleets to an alternative fuel, they can. There is a variety of vehicles and fuels from which to choose, with an array of tax incentives and deductions to help defer the costs of vehicle purchases. From the time the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) was passed 6 years ago and our nation's ambitious petroleEPAct Section 502 outlines the nation's um displacement petroleum displacement goals: goals were estab 10% replacement fuel use by 2000 lished (see Box 1),  30% replacement fuel use by 2010 federal, state, and Box 1 voluntary programs, such as Clean Cities, have sought to help jumpstart the alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) industry. We've made a lot of headway, but there's still a long way to go in order for EPAct goals to be reached. AFVs will need to comprise 35%40% of new vehicle purchases, and AFV sales growth will have to double every year for the next 5 years--from approximately 30,000 to 500,000 AFV sales per year. Currently available incentives are not large enough to induce this growth in the AFV market. The private and local government fleet commitments to AFVs may be the key to reaching our nation's EPAct goals. April 1, 1998, is the legal deadline for DOE to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) that starts the Department's effort to consider implementing a regulatory program for local government and EPAct section 507(g)--conditional private fleets. AFV acquisition requirements for local Although private government and private fleets: fleet requirements  20% of new vehicle acquisitions must will undoubtedly be AFVs in model year (MY) 2002 spark many  40% in MY 2003 debates, they  60% in MY 2004 could also ensure  70% in MY 2005 and thereafter significant growth Box 2 of the AFV market. This may be an opportune time to implement private and local government fleet requirements because increasingly more AFVs are available from the automakers. EPAct outlines conditional requirements of municipal and private fleets that may or may not be implemented (see Box 2). Under the law, DOE has several options for modifying the rule, including the choice to pursue no rule at all. DOE must also consider the petroleum replacement goals and whether or not to modify them. Each option will be outlined in the ANOPR and open for public comment. Should DOE decide to pursue a rule, the modification options include: (1) changing the start date of the program, thereby postponing the model year in which fleets covered under the rule must start acquiring AFVs; or (2) reducing the acquisition percentages specified in EPAct section 507(g). In addition to questions targeting feedback on local government and private fleet AFV requirements, the ANOPR will contain questions about including transit bus fleets in the rulemaking. Transit buses are perfect applications for alternative fuel use (pre-determined routes and central refueling), and they are already big players in the alternative fuel market. Many fleets have begun replacing their diesel-powered buses with alternative fuel buses. For example, SunLine Transit Agency in Coachella Valley, California, boasts a fleet that is 100% alternatively fueled. In fact, according to the American Public Transit Association, 22% of the new buses on order from January to April 1998 are powered by alternative fuels--an increase from 13.9% in 1996. After the ANOPR is published, DOE will collect input from the public for 90 days. The ANOPR will give a mailing address for written comments. Three separate hearings will be held in different cities, providing forums for people to voice their opinions and offer suggestions to DOE. Due to the vast number of fleets affected by the proposed ruling, the hearings should be very well attended. ""These hearings will offer the public an excellent chance to voice their opinions to DOE in person,"" said Ken Katz, DOE's program manager for EPAct rulemaking and compliance. ""The hearings also provide an opportunity for DOE to ask questions that will clarify or amplify a comment made, and thus enable DOE to use that information as it considers options for the fleet program."" Refer to upcoming issues of Alternative Fuel News for hearing dates and locations, and keep checking the Federal Register at www.epa.gov/ fedrgstr for the announcement and publication of the rulemaking and hearing date information. After the ANOPR comments are reviewed, DOE has until May 1, 1999, the legal deadline for publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) in the Federal Register. The NOPR, if published, would be a draft rule resulting from DOE's findings during the ANOPR comment review phase. The draft would outline the specifics of any proposed regulatory program, and ask for additional public comment. Following the NOPR public comment period, DOE would have to publish a final rule on or before January 1, 2000, for  4   it to be considered effective. ""The local government and private fleet program can be a vital component in the nation's efforts to decrease petroleum dependency,"" said Katz. ""The Clean Cities network can help facilitate this program via education, advocacy, and early adoption of AFVs.""  GSA Helps Federal Fleets Acquire AFVs The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) held a meeting last December to outline AFVs available to federal fleet customers in 1998. GSA leases vehicles to its federal customers through the Interagency Fleet Management System (IFMS). GSA increased its AFV lineup to meet EPAct and Executive Order demands, which in 1998 require 50% of all covered fleet light-duty vehicle purchases to be AFVs. The new lineup has additional vehicles and more flexibility than last year, helping fleet managers meet their specific vehicle needs (see box). GSA will allow fleet managers to purchase the midsized flexible-fuel Taurus in lieu of their normal compact purchases. However, the higher cost of leasing a mid-sized vehicle instead of a compact must be made up by higher payments in the first lease year. Fleet managers can still obtain AFVs by purchasing them through GSA's Automotive Division (formerly the Automotive Center).  AFVs Available through GSA IFMS Sedans Ford Contour (compact, bi-fuel, natural gas) Ford Crown Victoria (full-size, dedicated natural gas) Ford Taurus (mid-size, flexible-fuel, ethanol, or methanol) Trucks Ford Ranger (compact, electric) Chevrolet S10 (compact, electric) Chevrolet C2500 (full-size, bi-fuel, natural gas) Ford F250 (full-size, dedicated, natural gas) Minivans Chrysler Grand Caravan (mid-size, flexible-fuel, ethanol) Full-Size Vans (passenger and cargo) Ford E250 (full-size passenger, dedicated, natural gas) Ford E350 (full-size cargo, dedicated, natural gas) Freightliner MT45 (medium-duty cargo, dedicated, natural gas)  At the Pump DART's New Facilities Are Truly Texan The first of two 30,000-gallon, above-ground liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks was installed at the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) LNG refueling station. Built by Lone Star Energy, a Texas Utilities Company, the facility will service 210 LNG buses that DART will procure under separate contracts. The LNG used to fuel the buses is produced at the Amoco Chemical Chocolate Bayou plant near Alvin, Texas, and transported to the DART facility by LNG-powered tractor trailers. The buses are expected to consume up to 12 million gallons of LNG over 5 years as part of the contract with Lone Star Energy. ""The DART commitment to LNG will showcase to other heavy-duty fleet operators the advantages of using alternative fuels and contribute to improving the air quality in the Dallas/ Fort Worth metroplex,"" said DOE's Dan Deaton. ""I believe this project is unique in that the heavy-duty trucks that will haul the LNG to Dallas were converted to LNG utilizing Clean Cities Program funds received by Lone Star Energy, an active stakeholder in the Dallas/Fort Worth Clean Cities coalition."" The station is scheduled to be operational by March 1998, and the buses should be delivered later this Spring. For more information, contact Stan Taylor, Lone Star Energy Company Alternative Fuels Division, at 214-573-3854.  New Technologies Are Right around the Corner IMPCO Technologies, Inc. announced the opening of its new gaseous fuel technology center in Irvine, California. The new center focuses on the development and manufacture of automotive original equipment manufacturer fuel systems and fuel storage vessels, and provides advanced fuel system technology for heavy-duty engines, forklifts and small industrial engines. The center employs more than 100 professionals and has state-of-the-art testing equipment and laboratories. IMPCO is diversifying its products and services to meet global demands for cleanburning, energy-efficient technologies. IMPCO recently acquired two alternative fuel companies to diversify its product line and fully service the growing Mexican and Latin American markets. IMPCO is also teaming with General Motors on domestic and international ventures, including the development of a bi-fueled Chevrolet Cavalier. For more information, contact Dale Rasmussen at 206-575-1594, extension 306.  5   From the Automakers:  AFVs  Were a Hit at the Auto Shows  Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) were popular themes at the Los Angeles and Detroit Auto Shows held back-to-back in January. Both auto shows focused on environmentally friendly vehicles with advanced automotive technologies. The automakers demonstrated commitment to more energy-efficient and less polluting transportation. Photo courtesy of John Hampton, Abacus Technology/PIX 05467  Both General Motors' (GM) and Honda's EV exhibits were well attended. The GM EV1, available only through leasing, was a key attraction at GM's Saturn exhibit as EV1 owners shared their driving experiences. Honda's exhibit also drew crowds as attendees asked questions about the EV Plus, which is currently available in California through a pilot lease program. The Prius, Toyota's new HEV, was accompanied by an elaborate show highlighting the propulsion system. The display, with the help of video, component cutaways, and moving parts, showed how the hybrid system actually works. Currently, the Prius is being sold only in Japan, but it may be available in the United States through a 1999 pilot program. DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) exhibit, which featured a student-built HEV, also attracted much interest. The vehicle, built by the University of CaliforniaDavis, won first place in OTT's 1997 Future Car Challenge, a student engineering competition in which college students competed to build an 80-mpg fuelefficient vehicle that performs like a traditional vehicle. Engineering students, representatives from OTT's Office of Technology Utilization, and California Clean Cities' stakeholders answered questions about HEVs and explained the program's involvement in developing fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Consumers were especially excited about hybrids; many said they would buy them when they become available to the public. At the Detroit Auto Show, the automakers reinforced their commitment to advanced automotive technologies. GM showcased its advanced vehicles and EVs in a hightech video display featuring parallel and series hybrids, and methanol-powered fuel cell concept vehicle technologies. GM's EV1 was outfitted with an Ovonic nickel metal hydride battery, which could increase the EV1's range to 120160 miles per charge. ""Our family of clean car options  Detroit Auto Show--GM's prototype fuel cell concept vehicle  is growing fast,"" said Jack Smith, GM's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""This year, we're phasing in nickel metal hydride batteries to our pioneering vehicles, the EV1 and S10 electric truck, and we plan to have a production-ready HEV by 2001."" Ford unveiled its P2000 DIATA, a mid-sized HEV weighing 40% less than a standard mid-size sedan with a fuel economy of 63 mpg. The P2000 has an aluminum direct-injected compression ignition engine and lightweight body parts. Ford also displayed a fuel cell-powered P2000. ""Later this year we'll have an electric hybrid powered version of the P2000 on the road. And by 2000, we  6   Ford Moves into the Fast Lane Does America Want Ford's E85 Windstar? Ford Offers E85 Muscle Car You better not blink when you see Ford's future E85 offering, or you might miss it! Ford unveiled its Mustang Super Stallion concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January. The vehicle comes equipped with a 545-horsepower 5.4-liter engine with the E85 flexiblefuel option. The Super Stallion can do the quarter mile in a mere 13 seconds; whoever thought AFVs could be so much fun! The Stallion will be offered in limited quantities in model year 1999. For more details, call your local Ford dealer or the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE. Ford is currently testing prototype E85 Windstars in several test fleets throughout the Midwest. So far the vehicles are performing well, according to Rob Seiter of Ford Motor Company. ""Some of the vehicles have logged more than 15,000 miles and are performing flawlessly."" Most of the fuel system and engine emission control technology comes from the E85 Taurus, which has a history of reliable performance. One of the goals of the demonstration project is to evaluate consumer response to the product. Commercialization of the E85 Windstar will depend on an evaluation of market potential for the vehicle.  Ford Announces AFV Incentives for 1998 Ford FFV Taurus Sales Look Good for 1998 According to Ford representatives, favorable sales figures are expected for the flexible-fuel Taurus for 1998. The Taurus is one of the favorites of federal fleet managers who will be using these vehicles to meet EPAct purchasing requirements. The Taurus FFV has no increased incremental cost, which makes it an attractive option for fleet managers concerned about the bottom line. The flexible-fuel concept (a fuel system that can run on 85% alcohol, gasoline, or a combination of both) gives drivers fuel flexibility without additional costs. Ford has announced incentives for 1998 model year AFVs reaching $2,000 per vehicle. The car prices, different for each model, are based on the reengineering cost of each vehicle built to run on a specific fuel. The incentives include $1,000 for the flexible-fuel Taurus, and either $1,500 or $2,000 for the other AFVs. Also, the Ford EV Ranger has a $5,000 incentive off the actual price!

Chrysler displayed its Dodge Intrepid ESX2 sedan, which uses lightweight composite plastics and a dieselelectric hybrid engine to meet future vehicle emission requirements and achieve up to 70 mpg. Domestic automakers are currently working together to develop hybrids through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), a government/industry partnership between the Big Three automakers (Chrysler, Ford, and GM) and DOE. The partnership's goal is to  develop and bring to market a prototype 80-mpg vehicle by model year 2004. As shown by the demonstration of vehicles at the early 1998 auto shows, the new concept vehicles have significant technological advancements. However, these vehicles will be required to achieve the more ambitious PNGV goal of a safe, reliable, costcompetitive 80-mpg vehicle with very low emissions and a 100,000-mile vehicle life.  7   It's the classic chicken and egg story. Vehicles first, then stations? Or is it build the stations and the vehicles will follow, as in ""if you build it, they will come?"" It's a scenario that the alternative fuel vehicle industry has grappled with for several years. It seems that now, at least for one alternative fuel, the dilemma may be over. Ethanol industry stakeholders, together with DOE, are developing a plan that could lead to the widespread use of E85 flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) by the general public. This partnership is particularly timely as the conference in Kyoto (see cover story) has drawn much attention to climate change issues, and E85, as a domestically produced, renewable fuel, can mitigate potential problems associated with climate change. In June 1997, Chrysler announced that for the 1998 model year, all of its 3.3-liter minivans will be FFVs, capable of running on either E85 or gasoline at no additional cost. All will be E85-ready, which means as many as 200,000 new vehicles in major metropolitan areas across the country in the next year alone, a giant leap for the E85 vehicle market. Ford will extend the leap even further in model year 1999, when all of its 3.0-liter V-6 Ford Ranger pickups will be E85-ready. But where will these vehicles refuel? At the time of the automakers' announcement, there were just 38 public E85 refueling stations and 29 privat stations, mostly in the Midwest. Very few of these stations were located in major cities, only one in California, and none in the northeastern or southern states. That may have been fine for the approximately 10,000 E85 vehicles on the road, but what about 20 times that number? According to industry stakeholders, if all the Chrysler minivans used the E85 option all the time, the demand for E85 would increase by about 150 million gallons per year--the  The Chrysler E85 minivan equivalent of approximately 100 stations.

The today! plan is called the Action Plan to Promote the Development and Use of E85 Refueling Infrastructure (E85 Action Plan), and is now available in draft form for public comment. The plan aims to identify several major metropolitan areas where a significant number of the new FFVs can use E85 most of the time. E85 infrastructure could then be placed in these ""high priority"" areas with increased confidence that many vehicles will take advantage of the E85 option, laying a foundation for the expanded use of E85 as a transportation fuel. The strategic approach of the E85 Action Plan outlines proposed criteria for determining the high priority areas for infrastructure investment. It offers suggestions for determining areas that would best respond to E85 infrastructure investment, and ways in which industry stakeholders can ensure sufficient throughput of the new stations. Your input and buy-in are needed to move forward with the implementation of the action plan. ""The large-scale introduction of flexible fuel vehicles is a challenge to the ethanol producers and retailers--if they can provide a significant amount of fuel for this emerging market--they may well guarantee significant ethanol use in light-duty vehicles for  Ford's E85 Ranger Pickup  8  Photo courtesy of Ford Motor Company/PIX 05149  Photo courtesy of Chrysler Corporation/PIX05467  DOE Seeks Input on E85 Action Plan   years to come,"" said David Rodgers, director of DOE's Office of Technology Utilization. The potential for success is enormous. Widespread public availability of these vehicles, strategically located refueling stations, and effective education and outreach to alert people of these vehicles and the benefits of their use could mean a turning point for the  AFV industry. The summit in Kyoto has brought climate change issues to the forefront and set the stage for clean burning, domestically produced renewable fuels to penetrate the market. With a strong industry partnership and the right plan, E85 FFVs will be the breakthrough AFVs to be widely used.  To obtain a copy of the E85 Action Plan, call the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE, or check out the Office of Transportation Technologies web site at www.ott.doe.gov/news/actionplan.html.

From the Hill Converted Vehicles Subject to New Rules There have been diverse reactions to EPA's Addendum to Memorandum 1A, which tightened the certification standards for vehicle conversions. Many people are still adjusting to the more stringent EPA guidelines, particularly because converted vehicles won't count toward EPAct compliance unless they meet EPA conversion standards. Furthermore, EPA has set stiff penalties for noncompliance: $25,000 for manufacturers and $2,500 for individuals (per infraction). Some industries, such as the propane (LPG) industry, are hit harder than others. There are approximately 250,000 propane vehicles in the United States, most of which are conversions. The addendum will severely limit the availability of conversion kits in the short term. However, new LPG vehicles from Ford may help meet LPG vehicle demand. Some companies have changed their business strategies in order to comply with EPA guidelines. Companies are slimming down the number of vehicle applications for which they offer kits, and sell only the more popular conversion kits. Industry experts have forecasted that smaller companies will join together to merge capital and human resources. If you are a fleet manager who relies on vehicle conversions, get proof from your vendor that the conversion kits you purchase are EPA certified. Otherwise these conversions will have no value toward EPAct requirements and EPA could fine you. If you have any questions about conversions, call the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE, or browse the Alternative Fuels Data Center web site at: www.afdc.doe.gov.  CMAQ Funds Are Still Alive On December 1, 1997, President Clinton signed a 6-month extension to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). The extension, referred to as the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, permits the allocation of federal transportation funds to continue through May 1, 1998, and allows surplus funds to be spent through July 1, 1998. These funds, totaling approximately $15.5 billion, are being used for various programs including CMAQ (Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality) projects. Tommy Foltz, president of Clean Fuels Strategies, stated, ""People should continue to apply because if 1998 surplus funds still exist, stakeholders can get funding for alternative fuel-related projects, and send a message to Congress about the importance of reauthorizing the program."" According to Mike Savonis, of DOT's Federal Highway Administration, ""The serious competition for CMAQ funds demonstrates the continued viability and importance of the CMAQ program."" The extension bill is a positive action in that it allows states to continue obligating federal transportation funds; however, the extension is temporary. The current version of the Act, referred to as ISTEA 2, is now being debated in Congress. To learn more about ISTEA, visit the web site at www.istea.org. For more information on how to apply for funding, contact your local metropolitan planning organization, state DOT, or local office of the Federal Highway Administration.  9   Funding Opportunities SEP Grants Promote Partnerships One of the great attributes of the Clean Cities Program is that it brings together all the key players of the AFV market. State Energy Offices are among those key players. One way Clean Cities works with states is through the State Energy Program (SEP) Special Projects grant program. For the third year, DOE's Office of State and Community Programs, in conjunction with the Clean Cities Program, is offering approximately $2 million for projects that help accelerate the introduction or increase the use of AFVs. The benefits of the program are twofold: (1) it helps Clean Cities coalitions leverage funds to foster development of their local AFV markets, including projects to get more AFVs on the road, install infrastructure, develop educational tools, and build the organizational capacity of local coalitions; and (2) it helps strengthen the relationship between the federal, state, and local governments, and Clean Cities private-sector partners. Selected projects are funded as part of the state's SEP, so cities must work with their State Energy Offices on proposal development. ""As a former state energy official, I know firsthand the value and important role states play in building longterm public and private partnerships to create new markets for energy-efficient technologies. Clean Cities has a lot to gain from the experience and leadership of the State Energy Offices,"" said Marcy Rood, deputy director of the National Clean Cities Program. ""In regard to alternative fuel markets, State Energy Offices have provided leadership by offering guidance on AFV regulations, information on AFV products to public and private fleets, and support to their local Clean Cities, all of which is most appreciated,"" said Rood, ""I know we couldn't do it without them!"" Also unique to this year 's SEP funding is a partnership between the Clean Cities Program and DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). FEMP/Clean Cities are interested in funding three pilot programs that would develop a process to allow easy adoption of energy service performance contracting legislation for local and state facilities, and nonprofit schools and hospitals. Awards for both the Alternative Fuels Special Projects and the FEMP SEP Special Projects are available only to designated Clean Cities coalitions or groups that have submitted a formal application for official Clean Cities status. Winners will be announced this March, and will be highlighted in our next issue. For information on next year 's SEP, call Dorothy Wormley at 202-586-7028.  ICLEI Award Winners Announced The U.S. Office of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) has awarded $250,000 in grants to 10 U.S. cities and counties under the Transportation Solutions Grant Program (see box for winners). The program is offered annually though ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection Campaign-U.S., with funding provided by EPA's Transportation Partners and DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies and Clean Cities Program.  ICLEI Award Winners Mesa, Arizona Telecommuting project $25,000 Berkeley, California Electric Station Car Project $30,000 Los Angeles, California Traffic Enforcement Officers on Bicycles $14,500 San Jose, California Electric Vehicle Recharging Stations $17,500 Fort Collins, Colorado Propane-powered Shuttle Van Service $32,000 Miami Beach, Florida Electrowave Electric Bus System $25,000 Maplewood, New Jersey Natural Gas-Powered Community Jitney Service $25,000 New York City, New York Natural Gas-Powered Shuttle Service $30,000 Schenectady County, New York Natural-Gas Shuttle for Welfare-to-Work $28,000 Salt Lake City, Utah Police Officers on Electric Bicycles $23,000  Ninety-five U.S. local governments competed for the grant funding to support projects that incorporate alternative fuels, alternative fuel vehicles, or other technologies to reduce vehicle travel, air pollutants, and greenhouse gas emissions. The 10 projects chosen involve a variety of transportation solutions, including electric cars, buses, and bicycles; propane and compressed natural gas-powered shuttle vans; and telecommuting. Each project will help reduce the negative impacts of urban transportation on local air quality, global warming, and the quality of urban life. For more information on how to apply for funds under the ICLEI program, call Matt Nichols, ICLEI Sustainable Transportation Program Coordinator, at 510-540-8843.  10   EPA Pollution Prevention Can Help Clean Cities The EPA is soliciting grant proposals under the Environmental Justice through Pollution Prevention (EJP2) grant program. This program is designed to support pollution prevention approaches that address environmental justice concerns in affected communities. EPA anticipates that as much as $4 million will be available in FY 1998. Cost sharing is no longer required. EPA strongly encourages cooperative efforts between communities, businesses,  industry, and government to address common pollution prevention goals. Applications are due April 20, 1998. For more information contact Louise Little at 703-841-0483, or go to www.epa.gov/opptintr/ejp2. Recharge Your EV While Staying at the Hilton The Hilton Hotel Corporation is installing free electric vehicle (EV) recharging stations in all its Southern California locations. The stations are funded by General Motors Corporation and have been installed by Edison EV. The inductive chargers can fully recharge batteries in 1 hour.  Clean Cities Roundup l  Long Island. On December 2, the Long Island Clean Cities coalition hosted its first Alternative Fuel Vehicle Funding and Acquisition Clinic. This ""how-to"" workshop was developed to inform fleet owners and operators of the 1998 funding opportunities available for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on Long Island. The clinic included information on AFV grant programs and tax incentives available from the federal and state governments, fuel providers, and vehicle manufacturers. A ride and drive featuring electric vehicles (EVs), compressed natural gas, and propane vehicles afforded participants a handson experience with the technologies available for their fleets in the coming year. Local dealers and auto manufacturers were also available to discuss vehicle offerings, delivery dates, and purchase costs. More than 160 people attended the event, which was covered by local television and newspapers. Los Angeles. The City of Los Angeles recently received the Governor 's Environmental and Economic Leadership Award in the ""Environmental Economic Partnership"" category for its Quick Charge L.A. Program. The award, California's most prestigious environmental honor, was established in 1993 by Governor Pete Wilson to recognize outstanding achievements that successfully balance environmental protection and conservation with sustainable economic development. Under Quick Charge L.A., 29 public and private sector partners are working to develop EV infrastructure throughout the region in areas including shopping malls, hospitals, universities, office buildings, event centers, transit centers, and employers. The City of Los Angeles is also introducing 59 EVs into various departments including airports, harbor, transportation, water and power, and the zoo.  l  Florida Gold Coast. Miami's ""Electrowave,"" Florida's first electric shuttle bus system, began service on February 1 of this year. The Electrowave provides residents and visitors access to the many attractions in South Beach free of charge, 365 days a year. The system consists of seven fully air conditioned 22-passenger vehicles. Each is a moving work of art, with the exterior panels designed by one of five artists chosen in a design competition. The Electrowave shuttle bus system was developed by the Miami Beach Transportation Management Association and the City of Miami Beach, in partnership with the Florida Gold Coast Clean Cities Coalition, the Florida Departments of Transportation and Environmental Protection, Florida Power & Light Company, Florida Alliance for Clean Technologies, and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. Central Oklahoma. The Central Oklahoma Kids for Clean Cities initiative is already under way for 1998. This year 's feature project involves a partnership with students at Edmond Memorial High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, to create a Clean Cities magazine. Funded by a grant from the Oklahoma Department of Commerce and supplemented by advertising sales, the magazine will feature AFV fleets and businesses in Oklahoma. The students plan to enter the completed magazine in the Oklahoma Interscholastic Press Association's annual student magazine competition.  l  l  11   From the States  ec The New Jersey t: P Department of ower Com Transportation (DOT), in conjunction with New Jersey Transit and Transportation Management Associations (TMAs), has implemented a $1.5 million pilot project to promote commuter alternatives, decrease traffic congestion, and improve air quality.

CLE HI  Clean Cities Program Hits the Airwaves Channel surfers in a few select cities may catch a glimpse of the latest and greatest PBS series on alternative fuels entitled, On the Road to Clean Cities for the 21st Century. The series, a joint effort of the Clean Cities Program, New Vision Communications, and The Jefferson Energy Foundation, features video segments and panel discussions on current issues in the AFV industry. Each broadcast is taped in front of a live studio audience and will be packaged as one segment in a series of town hall meetings throughout the country. The series debuted on December 2 at the University of California Riverside's Studio Theater. This premiere show was broadcast live to PBS channel KVCR in San Bernardino and Orange Riverside Town Hall Panelists Counties. It opened with a Doug Henderson video segment Western States Petroleum Association featuring David William Keese Gergen, U.S. California Energy Commission News and World Mayor John Longville Report, who City of Rialto commented on Dennis Minano the connection General Motors between the Wayne Nastri transportation South Coast Air Quality sector and air Management District pollution.

For nearly 50 minutes, Bill Cook directed questions to the panelists and led an informative (and occasionally controversial) discussion on alternative fuels and the role of AFVs in Southern California. Although the panelists agreed that there is a definite need and viable role for AFVs, there were differences of opinion on the level of  Morristown, the first location in New Jersey to implement Solectria Force EV the project, uses Solectria Force EVs. The Solectria is a four-person sedan with a 50-mile range, regenerative braking, and cabin preheat. Charging boxes will be installed both at the train stations and work locations. The program benefits will greatly affect the people of New Jersey by closing the transportation gap between public transit and the workplace, reducing harmful automobile emissions, decreasing the number of singleoccupancy vehicles on our roadways, and creating a market for EVs in the state. ""It's great to see this partnership between government agencies and several private sector organizations--this is what Clean Cities is all about,"" said James Ferguson, DOE Clean Cities program manager for the Philadelphia Region. ""This is just another example of New Jersey's leadership and commitment to alternative fuels initiatives. The recently designated North Jersey Clean Cities Program should really benefit from this highly visible project,"" he said. Businesses that purchase the EVs at project end are eligible for a 10% alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) tax credit, and would receive a tax deduction if they install a charging infrastructure. The TMAs will manage the project at  j Pro  12   urgency, the degree to which these technologies can penetrate the market, and the timing of their introduction. Much of the attention was turned to the development of hybrid and fuel cell technologies. Although most of the participants agreed that fuel cell technology is the ideal alternative, the point was well made, especially by David Rodgers, director of DOE's Office of Technology Utilization, that there are readily available alternatives to gasoline today that can be very successful when placed in the appropriate application. Comments made after the show by the studio audience indicated that this message was by far the most important. The General Motors Innovention Center at EPCOT in Orlando, Florida, was the setting for the second show of the series, which was broadcast live to PBS stations in Miami and Tampa Bay. This show had a special feature, as it dovetailed into the Electric Vehicle Symposium-14 (EVS-14), also held in Orlando. Following the general introduction, the video featured scenes from the EVS-14 Exhibit Hall and provided an overview of EV technologies.

There were mixed reviews on whether natural gas and propane are the fuels of the future, but all agreed that they are viable options that are available today as a means to fight against air pollution and decrease our oil imports. Guests cited the lack of infrastructure as one of the main barriers to market penetration. Suggestions were made to focus future efforts on development of refueling stations, education for fleets on the benefits of AFVs, and explanation of the available incentives needed for greater penetration. With these goals accomplished, natural gas and propane could indeed become viable transportation fuels. The Clean Cities message will undoubtedly hit the television airwaves again soon. ""This sort of public outreach offers a special opportunity for the public to learn about the scope of this new technology and how it's becoming part of our everyday lives,"" said College Station panelist Dick Moreau, of General Motors.  Ethanol Refueling Station Opens in Kentucky 's Capital Kentucky's capital city of Frankfort recently opened its first ethanol facility. The new station is privately owned with full public access.

EVs through the Eyes of Child The decision to purchase an alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) may seem a lot less complicated through the eyes of a five-year-old. Daniel and His Electric Car, written by DOE's own Ann Hegnauer and published in partnership with General Motors, is the story of a little boy who goes with his dad to the Saturn dealership looking for a small, red car they can use for short family trips. Sounds like a job for GM's EV1, right? Young readers can learn all about electric vehicles (EVs) and how they work as the dealer takes Daniel for a test ride in an EV1. ""Our public outreach efforts to promote AFV use must also consider our nation's future drivers,"" said Hegnauer. ""Not only can kids influence their parents' choices, but a few years down the road when it's time for them to get behind the wheel, they will hopefully make the AFV choice.""

Electric Vehicle International Challenge (EVIC) The Electric Vehicle International Challenge (EVIC) brought together more than 50 elementary, middle, and high school teams to compete in designing electric vehicles. The major sponsors for the event were the DOE's Clean Cities and Student Vehicle programs, Florida Power and Light, and Toyota. The Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation was the managing organization, which comprises businesses, universities, and government entities to develop advanced transportation technologies for global markets. The EVIC included educational forum sessions and various competitions that were held in Orlando, Florida, on December 1114, 1997 in conjunction with EVS-14, the world's largest conference and exhibition devoted to electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The events were broken down into elementary, middle, and high school levels. The vehicle competition included design, troubleshooting, acceleration, slalom driving, and presentation. The focus of EVIC was to join today's students with the technological advancements in the automobile industry to help increase partnerships between industry and education. Of 13 competing schools, the overall winner was Northampton East High School in Conway, North Carolina.  14   On the Web Get AFN On-Line! www.afdc.doe.gov Do you have Internet access, an e-mail address?

D E P A R T M E N T o f  ENERGY  An Official Publication of the Clean Cities Network and the Alternative Fuels Data Center From the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy  Alternative Fuel School Buses Earn High Marks  PLUS: Biodiesel Expands Availability National AFV Day  INSIDE:  AFVs for '02   D  ear Readers,  For nearly eight years, Clean Cities stakeholders have rallied behind the notion that we must increase the use of alternative fuel to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil and strengthen our national energy security. I think it's accurate to conclude that for eight years, building a national, sustainable market for alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles has been an uphill climb. After the events of September 11, our call to action has never been more urgent, our cause has never been more important, and our success has never been more critical. Oil is one of the cornerstones of our economy and our national security. Our country now depends on other nations for 56 percent of the oil we use. What's more, transportation accounts for about two-thirds of the oil we consume. How's that for an Achilles Heel? This situation leaves our economy dangerously vulnerable to price shocks, and the potential for supply disruptions influences our options while we respond to terror. Increasing the use of domestically produced, clean alternative fuels in our vehicles is not the sole solution, but it is an important part of our nation's overall security strategy. As Clean Cities stakeholders, you understand this, and you are demonstrating the important role that alternative fuels can play in our transportation system. In this issue of Alternative Fuel News, we feature many of your efforts to build alternative fuel niche markets and highlight particular efforts to increase the use of a homegrown, renewable fuel--biodiesel. Thank you for your hard work, resolve, and continued commitments to increase the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. Best wishes, and as usual, enjoy the issue.

The story stated that greenhouse gas emissions are believed to ""cause ozone depletion, which contributes to global warming."" The statement is inaccurate. It should have said that such gases increase the so-called ""greenhouse effect"" on the atmosphere, which is widely known as global warming. Ozone depletion is a separate issue.  3   Alternative Fuel School Buses Earn High Marks So how do schools ensure a safe, clean environment? Power buses with alternative fuels, say the authors. The report suggests, ""alternative fuel technologies represent the cleanest available options for heavy-duty applications,"" and recommends that alternative fuel buses ""play an integral part in our emission-reduction strategy."" INFORM, a New York-based nonprofit organization, agrees. INFORM examined nine major emission studies comparing conventional diesel buses with natural gas buses and published its findings in ""Bus Futures: New Technologies for Cleaner Cities."" Specifically, INFORM reports that natural gas buses emit 40 to 86 percent less particulate matter and 38 to 58 percent less nitrogen oxides than diesel buses. Moreover, according to ""Bus Futures,"" natural gas is ""virtually toxic-free, while diesel exhaust contains more than 40 toxic constituents, about half of which are known or suspected carcinogens."" In addition to the clean air benefits, buses powered by domestically produced alternative fuels such as biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, natural gas, or propane can contribute significantly to our nation's energy security. ""School buses consume more than twice the amount of fuel used by the average passenger car,"" said Shelley Launey, Director of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Clean Cities Program. ""Collectively, when powered by alternative fuel, they can make a big difference in reducing our nation's petroleum consumption,"" she said. ""School buses are also highly visible to the community, which can generate good publicity for the school district or local government--they make an excellent alternative fuel niche market,"" she said.  M  Niche markets, according to the Clean Cities definition, are ""targets"" or opportunities for which alternative fuels Earlier this year, the Natural Resources Defense Council make sense. They include fleets with high mileage, high fuel-use vehicles that can reap the cost-savings benefits of (NRDC) and Coalition for Clean Air (CCA) published, using a less expensive alter""No Breathing in the Aisles,"" based on their native fuel.

The school absenteeism related to chronic conditions.  ost kids know not to stand behind their school bus. They know the bus could back up and accidentally hit them, and they know that the black smoke expelled from the tailpipe is not good to breathe. What they (and their parents) probably don't know is that the air inside the bus may pose an even greater health risk than what they're breathing outside.  4   majority is located in California, with large numbers also in Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Many of these fleets actively participate in the Clean Cities Program--for example, Clean Cities National Partner Award winners Northside Independent School District (Alamo Area coalition), Tulsa Public Schools (Greater Tulsa coalition), and Lower Merion School District (Greater Philadelphia coalition). The Clean Cities web site features a growing number of success stories about school bus fleets using alternative fuels such as biodiesel, natural gas, and propane. Whether they're required to (see side box) or they voluntarily pursue alternative fuels, school districts face a critical barrier--cost. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and propane may cost less than traditional transportation fuels, but the initial price of a new alternative fuel bus is approximately $30,000 more than a conventional vehicle.  districts finance the transition to a cleaner, alternative fuel fleet. For example, alternative fuel school buses feature prominently in the Comprehensive Energy Research and Technology Act of 2001, H.R. 2460, proposed by Congressman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY).  Specifically, Subtitle A of H.R. 2460, referred to as the ""Alternative Fuel Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2001,"" would create a $300 million, DOE-sponsored, competitive grant program to fund up to 15 demonstration projects in partnership with state and local governments. Eligible projects would According to the National include the purchase of AFVs such as school buses, as well as infraHighway Traffic Safety structure to support vehicles purAdministration, each year, chased with the grant money.  440,00 public school buses travel 4.3 billion miles to transport 23.5 million children to and from school and school-related activities.  Some school districts, however, have been able to take advantage of state and local incentives to defray the initial cost. California, for example, offers several programs, including the Compressed Natural Gas School Bus Incentive Program, which can help reduce the initial purchase price of an alternative fuel bus even below the cost of a conventional diesel bus. Incentives in other states include Arizona's SB2001, New York's Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act Funding, and Pennsylvania's Alternative Fuels Incentive Grants (AFIG) Program, among others. Soon, schools without the benefit of local incentives may also be eligible for help. If passed, several bills pending on Capitol Hill could help local governments and school  Subtitle D, also called the ""Clean Green School Bus Act of 2001,"" would establish a DOE grant program for local governments and others that provide bus service to public school systems. Funds would be available for purchases of alternative fuel or ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses that would replace older, dirtier vehicles. Buses purchased would be required to meet certain emission standards, which would become stricter over time. Funds would also be available for alternative fuel infrastructure, with an emphasis on shared or public access stations.  Alternative fuel school buses are now the rule in L.A. basin California's South Coast Air Quality Management District now requires public agencies in the greater Los Angeles area to purchase clean fuel vehicles when expanding their fleets or replacing older vehicles. The rules, which in August survived a Federal court challenge by the Engine Manufacturers Association, apply to vehicles including buses and garbage trucks. In particular, the Clean On-Road School Buses rule (#1195), now in effect, requires all new school buses purchased or leased to operate on alternative fuel. Buses may also be retrofit with a California Air Resources Board (CARB)certified control device to reduce air toxic and criteria pollutant emissions. For more on information, please visit www.aqmd.gov/news1/Fleet_court_decision.htm.  DOE's Clean Cities Program also offers funds for school bus purchases through the State Energy Program (SEP). Nearly $490,000 was awarded for alternative fuel school bus projects this year. School buses will remain a project category in SEP 2002. The solicitation was expected in November 2001. Clean Cities' new school bus tool, distributed to all designated coordinators this summer, can also help school districts select the AFV buses that best meet their needs and determine the cost benefits of making the conversion.

Much of biodiesel's growth followed its addition to the short list of alternative fuels eligible for the kind of AFV acquisition credits first defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Effective in January 2001, the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule (CFR4901.11.1) allows covered fleets to earn such credits through the purchase of biodiesel fuel, for use in blends of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel (called B20) or higher. EPAct applies to federal, state, and alternative fuel provider fleets. Biodiesel use by state and fuel provider fleets multiplied more than sixfold between 1999 and 2000, according to their reports to DOE. In 1999, 12 such fleets used roughly 86,000 gallons. In 2000, 28 state and fuel provider fleets used 563,000 gallons of biodiesel fuel (see chart). The main reason for biodiesel's success is its logical fit in the nation's portfolio of transportation fuels. Biodiesel can be blended in any proportion with petroleum diesel. B20 is one common blend. Pure unblended biodiesel is called B100, or ""neat fuel."" Covered fleet operators can meet up to half of their AFV acquisition requirements using biodiesel. One AFV credit is earned through every 450 gallons of B100 (2,250 gallons of B20) purchased.  T  here were no petrol stations in Paris when French-born Dr. Rudolf Diesel demonstrated his new compression-ignition ""diesel"" engine in 1900. His fuel was vegetable oil--chemically similar to the soybean oil now commonly used as a feedstock for biodiesel fuel. A century later, biodiesel is becoming a mainstream alternative fuel. In the past decade alone, according to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB), it has gone from a nearly non-existent market position to use in more than 100 major fleets. Biodiesel is used in trucking, public transit, school districts, agriculture, public utilities, and military fleets.  Biodiesel passes the test for New Jersey schools New Jersey's Medford School District clearly illustrates the advantages of using biodiesel in school buses. In a four-year test beginning in 1997, the district has run half of its 44 buses on B20 biodiesel fuel and the other half on petroleum diesel. In basic performance, says district operations director Joe Biluck, no differences were detected between the two groups of buses. Fuel economy and start-up ability were identical even in colder weather. Biluck says the B20-fueled buses seemed to idle more smoothly, perhaps because of biodiesel's greater oxygen content.  Biodiesel Usage in State and Fuel Provider Fleets Number of Fleets 30 Gallons of Biodiesel (in thousands) 600  25  500  20  400  15  300  10  200  ""From a fleet manager's point of view the integration was completely seamless,"" he says. Importantly, the biodiesel fuel emitted noticeably cleaner exhaust. With students gathering around buses every day , the heavy black smoke from petroleum diesel is a constant health hazard. At least one bus normally transports handicapped students who aren't able to move in and out of buses quickly, says Biluck. The Medford district is not covered by EPAct. Its biodiesel test was funded by a Heavy Duty Vehicle grant from DOE to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, Division of Energy Department of Environmental Protection, which will largely dictate the future direction of biodiesel in the district. ""If I had my way, we'd start using it in all of our buses,"" says Biluck.

Cincinnati bus passengers board the B20 Cincinnati this year put biodiesel into service in a big way, fueling 150 of its city transit buses with B20. The experimental program will continue through 2001. It follows several tests of alternative fuels by Cincinnati Metro dating as far back as 1993. ""Biodiesel cuts pollution without reducing engine power or mileage,"" claims Paul Jablonski, general manager of the agency. ""It gives us yet another way to improve our region's air quality."" The agency's use of B20 will increase fuel costs by about 10 percent per gallon.

The fuel is supplied by World Energy, Inc. of Boston. Further benefits will go to Ohio farmers who grow the soybeans to make biodiesel. The state of Ohio is fifth in soybean production nationally. According to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, demand for soybased products will bring ""significant economic benefits to U.S. farmers.""  special systems. To prevent such problems, effective steps include:  Blending with No. 1 diesel, which is lighter and more volatile;  Using a cold-flow enhancing additive;  Using a heater to warm the fuel tank, filter, or lines;  Indoor storage and overnight parking. Lowering the sulfur content of conventional diesel fuel is a widely debated, high-profile program objective of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. By June 2006, new EPA regulations will reduce allowable sulfur content in petroleum diesel to 15 parts per million (ppm), from the current limit of 500 ppm. The sulfur reduction may cause new problems--lost lubricity and accelerated engine wear. But biodiesel is well positioned to be part of the solution. Augmenting conventional diesel fuel with just one or two percent biodiesel can effectively  Biodiesel blends may require minor changes to existing fueling infrastructure. They are commonly stored in standard tanks used otherwise for petroleum diesel. Engines running on B20 generally need no modifications. But blends with higher biodiesel content are more likely to require modifications, particularly to the fuel system. Using biodiesel in a conventional diesel engine can reduce unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. A 1998 life-cycle analysis by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy showed a 78 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from B100 compared to petroleum diesel. Acid rain-causing sulfur oxides and sulfates, components of conventional diesel, can also be reduced significantly. But emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) tend to show a slight increase. Among other drawbacks, pure biodiesel can cause rubber and other components to fail, so some engine modifications may be necessary to use pure biodiesel in existing engines. There is often a reduction in fuel econ-  omy and power for pure biodiesel, varying among different engines. And because it is not widely available, biodiesel is currently more expensive than petroleum diesel. Like standard No. 2 diesel, biodiesel thickens at low temperatures, so using it in cold climates requires  Concrete improvements in Arizona's environment Business owner Grant Goodman switched his entire fleet of trucks and heavy equipment from petroleum diesel to biodiesel in January 2001. Approximately 120 trucks, loaders, and aggregators now run on B100 at Rockland Materials, a concrete and gravel-mining company in Phoenix, Ariz. Motivated by a desire to improve local air quality, Goodman researched the emissions benefits of biodiesel. ""What grabbed my attention was the fact that we could reduce carcinogen and hydrocarbon emissions by such a significant amount."" Performance of the fleet was unaffected, he says. The change-over caused ""zero problems""--except a shrunken bottom line. With the price of biodiesel in Phoenix running at least 25 percent higher than regular diesel, the change reduced profits. ""We're running a $300,000 deficit to our competitors,"" he said in September. As a private business operator, Goodman is not regulated by EPAct, and was not forced to switch. The move was voluntary. ""I don't get a tax break,"" says Goodman, whose trucks travel the busiest streets in greater Phoenix. ""With kids riding around in diesel-powered school buses, I felt I had do to something.""  7   EPAct credit sales spur biodiesel use in Iowa restore its lubricity, according to tests by Stanadyne Automotive Corp., the nation's largest independent fuel injection manufacturer. Several biodiesel-based diesel supplements are made for that purpose. Biodiesel is made from soybean oil and other vegetable oils, and from animal fats. To produce biodiesel, the fat or oil is reacted with an alcohol, such as methanol, in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium. The catalyst typically is recovered for re-use. Fluctuating oil prices have pushed interest in biodiesel to levels greater than expected. Even private businesses unaffected by EPAct have switched from petroleum diesel (see Concrete Improvements, page 7), motivated by a desire to reduce foreign energy dependence. Recent legislation in Iowa established a fund to be used exclusively to purchase biodiesel fuel for vehicles operated by the Iowa Department of Transportation. The measure, known as Senate File 465 as it moved through the State Legislature, could significantly boost the demand for biodiesel in Iowa. According to EPAct, state fleets An abundant soybean crop helps make exceeding their vehicle purchase renewable energy possible in Iowa. requirements may sell the excess credits. States that do so must certify that the vehicles yielding such credits were truly operated on alternative fuels. Iowa will use the funds it generated in this manner to purchase biodiesel fuel, which will help support Iowa's soybean crop. Iowa's use of AFVs began in the early 1990s with state-level legislation mandating the use of ethanol-fueled vehicles. The state's transportation department purchased many Ford Taurus sedans and fueled them with E85. Iowa's law preceded EPAct's effective date, says department fleet manager David May, and pre-EPAct purchases commonly earned double or triple credits for the state. EPAct credits earned by Iowa have exceeded requirements many times over, May says. Selling the excess credits has already generated more than $74,000, and is expected to generate another $50,000 in the next year. Those funds will help finance the development of another clean, domestic home-grown fuel in Iowa, where more than 100,000 gallons of B20 will be purchased in the coming year.  Many major trucking fleets have made the switch to biodiesel; most use B20.  For more information...

Provides guidance on EPAct compliance and reporting; provides full text of the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule.  In its share of the overall market for domestic transportation diesel fuel, biodiesel is still small, accounting for less than one-tenth of one percent. But annual production has grown rapidly, from 5 million gallons in 2000 to an estimated 20 million gallons in 2001. Future growth could be substantial, but is difficult to quantify in part because biodiesel's success in the marketplace is so recent. Most biodiesel users are fleets, but growth in demand by individual users has spawned several publicly accessible fueling stations nationwide. Biodiesel now is produced in nine plants nationwide, with approximately 14 more in development or under construction, setting the stage for increased use in the future.  8   Coalitions Invited to Join  National AFV Day AP R I L 11, 2 0 02 Coordinators and all stakeholders in the Clean Cities Program are encouraged to participate in National AFV Day, a celebration of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on April 11, 2002. The event was conceived by the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC), a group of technical schools, colleges, and universities devoted to training auto technicians in the service of AFVs. The group has 20 full members and approximately 60 associate and affiliate members including high school automotive programs, fuel providers, and Clean Cities coalitions. The NAFTC expects concurrent participation at the locations of many of its members and affiliates. ""We're trying for at least 100 sites,"" said NAFTC executive director Al Ebron. ""AFVs remain a wellkept secret, despite a growing number of manufacturers that produce them for the consumer market, and despite federal and state incentives for their use in government and business fleets."" The group offers a free information package with suggestions on how to stage and sponsor a local event. It includes guidelines for print communications such as press releases, and artwork for use in advertising. Also included is a draft letter of agreement, to use in signing up participants for local events. DOE's Clean Cities Program is one of several stakeholders working with the NAFTC to make the event happen. Others include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, and Ford Motor Company. Organizers of local events are encouraged to seek the support of local entities to act as co-sponsors. National AFV Day is intended to promote AFV use in general and AFV service training in particular. Events should be should be designed to build and strengthen relationships, and aimed at target markets. Invitees could include legislators, health and environmental organization representatives, school board officials, fleet operators, auto dealers, car club members, and civic-minded individuals. At training locations, events can be a means to attract new students. Sponsoring a National AFV Day event shares much in common with the staging of Advancing the AFV Choice events by Clean Cities coalitions. The NAFTC encourages local sponsors to customize events according to local needs. To appeal to prospective students, for example, sponsors might include hands-on training or a scholarship giveaway. Other attractions can include:        An AFV ride-and-drive Technology demonstrations Contests and prizes A fair, gala, or open house Exhibits and panel discussions Educational presentations might cover:       AFV purchasing options, vehicles, and local dealerships Federal and state tax incentives Environmental benefits; impact on demand for foreign oil Local refueling and service options, locations  Events staged for National AFV Day, on April 11, 2002, may have much in common with past Advancing the AFV Choice events.  Trade shows and technology displays blend well with more festive events such as an outdoor barbecue. Media coverage can be cultivated successfully, as shown by Sheble McConnellogue (top right) of Colorado's Weld/ Larimer/Rocky Mountain National Park coalition.  Several Clean Cities coordinators have already expressed interest in participating in National AFV Day. One is Erin Russell, director of EVermont, which manages the Clean Cities Program in Vermont. ""We're excited about the opportunity to be part of such an important event,"" said Russell. ""Drawing attention to alternative fuel vehicles on a national scale is the key to broadening acceptance and use of these vehicles.""

Consumers have a new and improved tool to help them select their new vehicle. In a kickoff to Energy Awareness Month, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced the availability of new model year Fuel Economy Guide in a ceremony on October 9 at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). DOE produces the guide, published in print and on-line at www.fueleconomy.gov, in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition to fuel economy information, the web-based guide offers vehicle-specific emissions, greenhouse gas, and safety ratings data, creating a comprehensive, one-stop shop for new car-buyers. A dynamic web site, www. fueleconomy.gov features an annual fuel cost calculator and allows users to search for specific vehicles by class, make and model, miles per gallon--and of course, by fuel. Side-by-side comparisons of up to three vehicles at a time also enable users to select the cleanest, safest, most fuelefficient vehicle that meets their needs. at new car dealerships, public libraries, and credit unions nationwide. Initially launched in the fall of 1999, www. fuelecomomy.gov has experienced 1 million user sessions.  Buyer's Guide Adds AFV Ordering Info Vehicle ordering-window information for model year 2002 is now available on the Clean Cities Fleet Buyer 's Guide at www.fleets.doe.gov. The new feature, updated monthly, reports generally on production schedules for all AFV manufacturers. Production for low-volume vehicles such as AFVs is less consistent than that of traditional vehicles. In the past, vehicle buyers have waited as long as six months to have orders filled. The new feature indicates when orders are accepted, and gives a realistic idea of anticipated delivery dates. Available for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles, the information is accessible by clicking on ""How Can You Buy an AFV?"" The site also calculates the net incremental costs of buying AFVs, compared to conventional vehicles.  Alternative Fuel Price Report Clean Cities' Alternative Fuel Price Report provides a glimpse of fuel prices around the country. Obtained with the help of Clean Cities stakeholders, the prices are tabulated to illustrate trends and allow for price comparisons among alternative fuels, gasoline, and diesel fuel. The quarterly report is distributed to Clean Cities coordinators and posted on the Web at www.afdc.doe.gov/periodicals.html.  Find Used AFVs at AFVMarket.com Not everyone prefers a brand-new car, but used vehicles--particularly clean, alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs)-- are sometimes hard to find. Now, thanks to two long-time AFV champions, shopping for a used vehicle is a little easier. EV Rental Cars and EV World.com have joined forces to create AFVMarket.com, a new web site listing pre-owned AFVs and hybrid-electric vehicles available for sale at a discounted rate, compared to the original purchase price. The AFVMarket.com inventory consists of late-model vehicles, many of which were previously used as rental cars stationed at EV Rental locations in California, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. Available vehicles include the natural gas powered Ford Crown Victoria and Honda Civic GX, as well as the hybridelectric Honda Insight. The hybrid-electric Toyota Prius is expected soon. In addition to vehicle-specific searches by price, mileage, and location, the web site provides warranty information and offers links to the Clean Cities Fleet Buyer 's Guide for details about available incentives. For more information, please visit www.afvmarket.com.  DOE's Fuel Economy Guide for model year 2002 is now online. The print version will be available at car dealerships later this fall.  For energy- and cost-conscious consumers, the web site offers fuel-saving drivers' tips. A new gasoline price page can also direct users to stations offering the least expensive gas in town, and a new consumer information page answers a host of frequently asked questions about fuel pricing and can help drivers understand exactly where their money goes each time they visit the gas pump. The entire Model Year 2002 Fuel Economy Guide can be downloaded and printed from the web site. Officially printed guides will be available to the public later this fall  10   From the Automakers AFVs, Advanced Technology Vehicles Join the '02 Line-up Flex-fuel, bi-fuel, and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles return with few changes among automakers' offerings for the new model year. A complete listing of AFVs for 2002-- with powertrain, fuel capacity, and driving range information--can be found in the Alternative Fuels Data Center at www.afdc.doe.gov/pdfs/wModel_Year2002AFVs.pdf. From American Honda comes the Civic GX, a CNGfueled version of Honda's coupe. The GX boasts one of the world's cleanest combustion engines, says its manufacturer. Also from Honda is the hybrid Insight, powered both by batteries and gasoline. A hybrid-powered Civic will join the Honda line-up next spring. Hybrids do not qualify for EPAct fleet use credits, however.  The Ford Ranger pickup is available with E85 flex-fueling or electric power.  Mazda's B3000 pickup--essentially the same vehicle as Ford's Ranger, made in the same factory--is offered with E85 flex-fueling as well. Ethanol-powered pickups and SUVs from General Motors include the flex-fuel Tahoe, Suburban, and Sonoma. A small GM pickup and a passenger van offer CNG bi-fueling, with an onboard switch to select gasoline or natural gas. The electric-powered two-seat EV-1 coupe is available in California and Arizona only. Wieck Photo Database  Honda's natural gas-fueled Civic GX boasts of one of the world's cleanest combustion engines.  Of interest to electric utilities seeking EPAct compliance may be Toyota's RAV4-EV, an all-electric mini-SUV with an advertised driving range of 125 miles. Toyota also offers the Prius, a hybrid coupe that can go 570 miles on a tank of gasoline. To help California meet its own strict zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) requirements, Nissan offers the new Altra-EV, a mid-size wagon with lithium-ion battery power available to select fleets. Solectria's Citivan, sold nationwide, is the a service van with lead-acid battery power and a 40-mile range.  DaimlerChrysler now configures many of its vans and ever-popular minivans for natural gas and for E85 ethanol flex-fueling. In the Dodge Ram Van and Ram Wagon, a dedicated CNG-powered 5.2 liter V8 engine produces 200 horsepower. Among minivans, the Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Caravan can go more than 300 miles on a tank of E85. For light-duty truck fleets regulated by EPAct, Ford offers several variations of its half-ton pickup. The F-150 can be had with CNG-dedicated, CNG bi-fuel, and even LPG bi-fuel power. The smaller Ranger pickup is available with E85 flex-fueling; and with battery-electric power (and a range of 73 miles). Ford offers other flex-fuel vehicles including the Taurus sedan and various models of the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford Motor Company's new TH!NK enterprise, founded to create environmentally friendly vehicles, plans limited U.S. distribution of its first neighborhood electric vehicle. The TH!NK neighbor will be sold in California and in many Sun Belt states in 2002. The four-seat neighborhood electric vehicle has a top speed of 25 mph.  Nissan's electric-powered Altra-EV is available only in California.  11  Nissan  Wieck Photo Database   Challenge Bibendum 2001 A rally by tire maker Michelin helps automakers put AFVs in the spotlight Tires play an important role in fuel efficiency, and the ambitious efficiency gains expected of cars in the future will demand superior tire technology. With that assertion, French tire manufacturer Michelin kicked off its third-ever Challenge Bibendum, a competitive event for ""environmentally innovative vehicles,"" from Oct. 26-29, 2001. The four-day event attracted both production vehicles and one-of-akind prototypes, powered by electricity, natural gas, propane, hydrogen, and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as diesel fuel and various hybrid-electric configurations. At least 10 vehicle makes were present, with participation by U.S., European, and Japanese automakers. Michelin  More than 30 vehicles completed the 227-mile trek across southern California and Nevada.  The Michelin Man's real name is ""Bibendum,"" a French reference to the ability of tires to ""drink up road hazards.""  In Los Angeles, the event opened with an elegant auto show in the Spanish courtyard of the historic Auto Club of Southern California. Attended by many international journalists, the day focused on styling and design. ""Beautiful cars can be environmentally friendly; let's not choose between fun and green,"" said Edouard Michelin, chairman of the host company and great grandson of its founder. The ZEbus, operated by SunLine Transit, demonstrated superior range due to roof-mounted hydrogen fuel supplies.  Next was a full day of track testing at the California Speedway. Vehicles competed in tests of acceleration, fuel efficiency, driving range, noise, braking, and slalom performance. Rather than vying against each other, however, production vehicles were measured against emission and performance standards set by their own manufacturers. No overall winners were declared. A hydrogen-powered adaptation of the 1965 Shelby Cobra CSX dominated acceleration tests. Day 3 marked the main event, a road rally, with a 32vehicle caravan crossing the desert from southern California to Las Vegas. Few zero-emission vehicles made the 227-mile trip. One notable exception was a relay team of four fuel cell-powered cars sponsored by the California Fuel Cell Partnership. Also making the trip was the 40passenger ZEbus, powered by Xcellsis and Ballard, and operated by the SunLine Transit Agency. SunLine, which is the driving force behind the Coachella Valley Clean Cities Coalition, provided mobile refueling of CNG and hydrogen-powered cars along the route. The event concluded with a recap for journalists arriving in Las Vegas for one of its biggest annual conventions, that of the Specialty Equipment Market Association. The SEMA show began with a conference on ""The Transportation Transformation,"" focusing on sustainable mobility for the 21st Century.

Alternative fuels and the Air Force have come together at Robins Air Force Base, 100 miles south of Atlanta. Robins AFB occupies nearly 9,000 acres and is home to 19,800 military and civilian personnel. It has long been a leader in military transportation, with responsibility for maintaining many tactical, cargo, and fighter aircraft. Its Support Equipment and Vehicle Management Directorate procures nearly 90 percent of ground vehicles for the Air Force worldwide, and 100 percent of support equipment such as bomb loaders and electric generators. reformer. Also in progress is a solid-oxide fuel cell that runs hotter and burns less fuel than a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The office has worked with industry partners in developing other AFV systems, including diesel-hybrid shuttle buses that now operate on the base. Roughly 500 vehicles at the base operate on some form of alternative fuel. The Electric-powered Multistop Cube Vans, used daily for cargo delivery at Robins, are total number of vehislated for upgrades such as a rapid-charge cles present, includsystem from EPRI/Southern Company. ing heavy trucks, is approximately 1,500. The resulting environmental impact was a factor in motivating the Robins Air Force Base to investigate the Clean Cities Program. Perazzola and other base personnel have been involved in forming a new coalition in central Georgia, working with the cities of Macon, Perry, and Warner Robins. The stakeholders hope to see their Clean Cities application completed and approved by spring of 2002. If they succeed, Robins will be one of approximately 20 military stakeholders in Clean Cities coalitions nationwide. Others include the U.S. Navy Public Works Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and more than a dozen Air Force bases around the country. Such organizations promise to fill an important niche market within Clean Cities. Both as an AFV buyer and a developer of technology, the military will help move the U.S. toward energy security, as part of its crucial role in national security in general.  Hybrid-electric tow tractors at Robins mate a Cummins diesel engine with 48 lead-acid batteries and a 100-kilowatt Seimens motor.  Robins also houses the Alternative Fuel Vehicle System Program Office (AFVSPO) for the Air Force. For years, the base has been using and experimenting with AFVs, hybrids, and various advanced-technology vehicles. The Robins base and the military are interested in alternative fuels for several reasons, says Carl Perazzola, civilian director of the AFVSPO. One is strategic, related to an Air Force initiative called Single Battle Fuel Forward. The assumption is that jet fuel (known in the military as JP8) will always be present--and necessary--in combat. But a diverse range of other fuels will help ensure a constant supply of feedstocks. That heightens the military's interest in hydrogen fuel cells, says Lieutenant James Muldoon, an engineer working in the AFVSPO. Hydrogen can be produced by reforming many fuels including diesel, gasoline, ethanol, and CNG. It can also be derived from water through electrolysis. The AFVSPO is developing fuel cell technology in many applications and variations, including a JP8-to-hydrogen fuel  ISE Research, Inc.  Hawaii's Hickham Air Force Base participated in a statewide electric vehicle demo program in July, with 15 Hyundai Santa Fe all-electric SUVs.  13   Clean Cities Roundup Top Ten Clean Cities Coalitions for 2000  Northeast Ohio San Joaquin Valley Los Angeles San Diego Region Dallas/Ft.

Similar to previous years, however, survey responses will be used to select winners of the annual coalition awards presented at the National Clean Cities Conference, as well as determine the annual top ten ranking--so coordinators are urged to be as accurate as possible and submit their reports on time. For more information about the annual Clean Cities Coordinator survey, please contact TG Powell at 202-586-8077 or tg.powell@ ee.doe.gov.  FuelMaker and Honda Offer Clean Cities Incentive Clean Cities Announces Top Ten Coalitions The National Clean Cities Program recently announced the ""top ten"" best performing coalitions in 2000, identified in the map above. The annual top ten list is determined using data collected from the annual Clean Cities Coordinator surveys which document coalition activities in the previous year. Specific criteria include the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), alternative fuel refueling stations added during the year, and the total number of AFVs and stations in a coalition's service area. The ranking criteria, based on a point system, are weighted according to the level of investment required and the expected amount of actual alternative fuel used. Refueling station construction, for example, receives significantly more points than individual vehicle acquisition because of the investment involved; heavy-duty AFV acquisitions receive more points than light-duty vehicle acquisitions, and dedicated vehicles earn more points than flex-fuel vehicles because they typically displace more petroleum. Coalition activities such as membership meetings, media coverage, and outreach events are also considered when developing the ranking, although no point value is assigned. In another important note to coalition coordinators, the National Clean Cities Program also has announced a change in the timing of the annual survey. In response to coordinator concerns, survey has moved from spring to fall. Coordinators should have already received their 2001 surveys, which are due this December and intended to document year 2001 activities. To ease the transition, the new survey includes fewer questions than those from previous years and will cover only the basics, such as AFV acquisitions, FuelMaker Corporation and American Honda have partnered to offer Clean Cities coordinators and stakeholders an increased discount on purchases of FuelMaker natural gas refueling units and Honda's dedicated natural gas-powered Civic GX. The deal, available for vehicles purchased and delivered before March 31, 2002, increases previously available incentives and is open to private businesses and government fleets (natural gas utility fleets and individuals are ineligible). FuelMaker will increase its individual refueling unit incentive to $700 for each small unit and $2,200 for each large unit. Honda will increase its incentive, offered for each group of four Civic GXs purchased, to $1,200. For more information on the Honda-FuelMaker Clean Cities incentive, please visit www.fuelmaker.com/ccpromo or call Paula Herbert of FuelMaker at 800-898-3835.  Funding Available for Clean Cities Projects Attention Clean Cities Coordinators! The 2002 State Energy Program (SEP) Alternative Fuels Special Projects grant solicitation will be available in December and can be downloaded from the Clean Cities Web site at www. ccities.doe.gov/support.shtml. More than $4 million will be available to fund projects in the following categories: niche markets, infrastructure, school bus technologies, alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) signage, and Clean Cities coordinator positions. Important changes include more funding available for infrastructure projects and a new AFV signage category. Only designated Clean Cities coalitions are eligible for funding. For more information, please call your DOE Regional Office Clean Cities manager.  14   Toyota Supplies Electric SUVs to 10 Clean Cities Coordinators Denver Clean Cities Coordinator Mike Gutirrez stands beside a Toyota RAV4-EV. The vehicle is one of 10 electric-powered 1998-model vehicles loaned to coordinators by Toyota Motor Company, as a gesture of support for Clean Cities coalitions. Toyota provided the vehicles for one year of use, along with one electric charging station to accompany each vehicle. An employee of public utility Xcel Energy, Gutirrez recently signed on as full-time coordinator of the Denver coalition following eight years of service by Deborah Kielian of the City and County of Denver.  From the States AFVs: The Latest Campus Craze With relatively short vehicle routes and central fueling capabilities, university campuses can be an ideal niche for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The University of Kentucky, for example, recently renovated its entire fueling facility and installed an E85 tank so its 75 flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) can use alternative fuel. Drivers at Murray State University (MSU) in western Kentucky are also fueling their 35 FFVs with E85 from a new on-site pump. But E85 isn't the only alternative fuel of choice at MSU. In response to professors' concerns, the school is considering alternatives to its gasoline and diesel-powered support equipment, including quiet, electric-powered mowers. Some faculty and staff members will also have an opportunity to drive Ford Th!nk EVs in a station car program coming soon to the university. In addition to its EVs, Emory has a fleet of ten compressed natural gas (CNG) shuttles. Drivers refuel using a FuelNet card--the key to Atlanta's universal refueling program--to obtain CNG from a nearby station owned by the city of Atlanta. The school plans to build an on-site CNG station that will also be accessible to other fleets participating in the FuelNet program.  But perhaps the most popular in Emory's AFV program is what the students call the ""Garage Mahal,"" a new parking deck built specifically to accommodate up to 50 electric rechargers. Partially funded by a DOE State Energy Program grant in coordination with Clean CitiesThe University of Louisville recently Emory University's ""Garage Mahal.""

They drive AFVs. President Bush, when visiting his ranch in Crawford, Texas, now drives a propane-powered Ford F-250 pickup truck. What's more, the vehicle prominently displays a Clean Cities window decal. On November 7, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey joined other propane vehicle proponents in an informal ceremony to recognize the installation of a propane refueling station on the President's ranch. Also, although the truck has been in use on the ranch since August 5, a ceremonial key to the President's new AFV was presented to Bush Ranch foreman, Kenneth Englebrecht, to mark the addition of a cleanfueled vehicle to the President's ranch fleet. Its Texas location makes propane an excellent energy choice for the Bush Ranch. According to the Propane Energy and Research Council (PERC), Texas ranks first  in the nation in industrial propane production, the total number of vehicles and vehicle fleets that run on propane, and the total number of propane fueling stations. In addition to Launey, ceremony speakers included Michael Williams, Texas Railroad Commission Chairman; Bruce Toellner, vice president of Mitchell Energy and Development and chairman of the Propane Education and Research Council; and Curtis Donaldson, president of Clean Fueling Technologies, a propane equipment and service provider.  16  AP Photo/Kenneth Lambert"

This was most evident as we celebrated the 7th National Clean Cities Conference and Expo in Philadelphia. Alternative fuel stakeholders from across the country--from all over the world, for that matter--spent three robust days in Philadelphia, experiencing ""The Alternative Fuels Revolution."" The conference was an overwhelming success, and many heartfelt thanks go out to our host coalition, the Greater Philadelphia Clean Cities Program, and its stakeholders. You can read all about this year 's conference in our feature story.  We also recently welcomed two new coalitions to the Clean Cities Program--the Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition and the Vermont Clean Vehicles Coalition. (An interesting note: both designations were ""round two"" for their respective coordinators. Twin Cities' Tim Gerlach helped shepherd the Red River Valley Clean Cities Coalition to designation in 1998, and Vermont's Erin Russell helped guide the Northeast Ohio Clean Coalition to its designation in 1999). These newest coalitions, quite different from one another, bring unique experience and expertise to the Clean Cities network. Twin Cities stakeholders have developed the nation's largest network of E85 refueling stations and have focused much of their efforts on bringing the public (the thousands of flexible-fuel vehicle drivers in and around the Twin Cities) to its clean fuel options. The Vermont coalition, on the other hand, serves a much smaller, less populated region of the country. And although the coalition cannot claim 60 public fueling stations like the Twin Cities, it has been extremely successful in communicating the Clean Cities message and in generating support from the local community. In fact, in a surprise announcement at the designation, Vermont Governor Howard Dean offered to pay a third of the total cost of an AFV for any municipal fleet that commits to alternative fuels.

(See ""AFV and Alternative Fuel Legislative Proposals,"" page 5.) Another bill known as the CLEAR Act, sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Representative David Camp (R-Mich.), would create a ""tiered"" system of tax credits to reward AFV buyers according to the amount of environmental benefit expected of their vehicles. The National Energy Policy includes several recommendations pertaining specifically to alternative fuels and energy efficiency. One suggests tax credits for the purchase of hybrid and fuel cell-powered vehicles between 2002 and 2007. It also recommends continuing the current federal excise tax exemption for ethanol production, which ultimately makes ethanol fuels such as E85 more affordable for consumers. The policy acknowledges the familiar problem of ""flexible-fuel"" vehicles, which have the capability to cut petroleum consumption, but in reality often run on gasoline: ""Reforms to the federal alternative fuels program could promote alternative fuels use instead of mandating purchase of vehicles that ultimately run on petroleum."" Specific program changes are to be developed by appropriate agencies. Also recommended is a review of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, with due consideration of a report by the National Academy of Sciences, expected in July. The policy supports ""marketbased approaches"" to increasing fuel economy, which might include joint government-industry efforts such as the Clean Cities Program and other budding partnerships to promote green vehicles. Industry-funded educational programs are recommended, with emphasis on ""energy's compatibility with a clean environment.""  A  s the 2001 calendar reaches midyear, energy issues have taken center stage throughout the U.S. and in Washington. By any measure, the debate over how America will fuel its future has commanded acute attention. Sparked partly by rising electricity and petroleum prices, and lack of generating and refining capacity to satisfy our growing demand, the national discussion on energy has brought a renewed public focus to a host of issues including fuel efficiency, alternative transportation fuels, and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). In mid-May, the National Energy Policy Development Group, led by Vice President Dick Cheney, completed three months of policy-making effort. The resulting 163-page document includes 105 specific energy-related recommendations, addressing everything from power line construction to clean coal. (The document is available in its entirety at www.whitehouse. gov/energy.) As intended, the National Energy Policy has generated much discussion since its release. Like any policy statement of its kind, the Bush-Cheney energy plan does not carry the force of law. Rather, it aims to influence members of Congress to write new legislation, incorporating the wishes of the administration as well as the American people, after a reasonable period for public feedback. The policy may also support future executive orders from the White House. Several congressional bills propose new incentives for infrastructure development and vehicle purchases. Others will represent the return of older ideas, unveiled in previous congressional sessions but never passed.  The National Energy Policy recommends continuation of a federal tax exemption for the production of ethanol, often made from corn.  4  Warren Gretz, NREL/PIX 00643   Many legislative initiatives, both proposed and pending, are affected by funding for programs under DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. A review of those programs was recommended in the National Energy Policy, and related public comment was given in June, in public hearings held in seven major cities. With input from those hearings, legislators and the administration will continue shaping our nation's energy policy.  Advanced bus propulsion technologies would benefit under TEA-21, an ongoing clean fuel grant program supported in the National Energy Policy.

For long-haul trucks, it recommends measures to reduce emissions and fuel consumption, partly through alternatives to idling (see AFN Vol. 5, No. 1).   2001  CLEAN CITIES  CONFERENCE REPORT  Philadelphia Hosts Clean Cities Alternative Fuels Revolution The Seventh National Clean Cities Conference and Expo assembled a unique cast of characters, as alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) advocates joined Ben Franklin and several of his 18th century Philadelphia friends eager to partake in ""The Alternative Fuels Revolution."" This year 's conference, hosted by the Greater Philadelphia Clean Cities Program, proved to be an exciting and productive gathering of the nation's Clean Cities stakeholders. More than 1,400 attendees of all ages experienced a trip back in time to colonial Philadelphia, where Ben Franklin and company visited with attendees in the Pennsylvania Convention Center and helped guide them to conference events and receptions throughout the city. Following a welcome from Clean Cities' Philadelphia hosts, Program Director Shelley Launey kicked off the conference by presenting the ""State of Clean Cities."" Fluctuating energy prices illustrate the need for transportation fuel diversity, she said. A look at conventional and alternative fuel price swings over the past few years, along with the reasons for these swings, made it possible to make reasonable assumptions about future costs of all fuels. ""In the midst of adversity, there is a lot of opportunity."" She also highlighted several ""AFV Heroes""--local fleet managers who have made a difference in building local and regional AFV markets. DOE's Tom Gross, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technologies, read a personal greeting from Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham. He also described the growing worldwide demand for oil and how U.S. imports of oil are rising at a near-record pace. ""So what do we do about this oil situation? We increase supply of all kinds of fuels--particularly clean, domestic ones--and we reduce demand,"" he said, setting the stage for the week's Clean Cities events.  Steve Linnell of the Greater Portland Clean Cities Coalition accepted one of the 2001 Legal Eagle Awards for sponsoring legislative initiatives affecting AFV users in Maine. NREL/PIX 10102  Something Old and Something New Keeping with Clean Cities conference tradition, the panel discussions, breakout sessions, and side events (including festive receptions, courtesy of conference sponsors) offered opportunities to network and exchange ideas. This year 's new faces and agenda features also brought unprecedented enthusiasm and excitement. On each of the three days of the conference, concurrent breakout sessions gave attendees a chance to tailor their agendas to their own interests. They could listen to panel discussions and participate in one-on-one ""car talks"" with experts in a variety of specific subjects, including niche markets, manufacturer product lines, emissions studies, and project funding opportunities. In a break from conventional conference subject matter, many of this year 's sessions were designed to intellectually  stimulate attendees and engender provocative exchange about global energy issues, and the future of alternative fuels. Featured speakers included authors, professors, media personalities, and even the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  6  NREL/PIX 10103  Salt Lake City Coordinator Bev Miller, recognized last year as Outstanding Coordinator for 2000, received an additional honor at this year's Clean Cities Conference. Miller accepted the key to a CNG-fueled Honda Civic GX from Stephen Ellis of American Honda.  NREL/PIX 10100  The Wisconsin Clean Cities Southeast Area Coalition, represented by Nicole Anderson, was a dualaward winner, accepting the Empire Award for adding the most new stakeholders; and the A Few Good Fleets Award for adding the most new private fleets.  NREL/PIX 10101  On behalf of the Los Angeles Clean Cities Coalition, Dee Allen accepted two Coalition Awards from Tom Gross of DOE: The Gold Star Award, which recognizes coalitions that have added the most AFVs; and the Legal Eagle Award for supporting AFV legislation at the state or local level.   2001  CLEAN CITIES  CONFERENCE REPORT At Tuesday's coalition awards breakfast, General Motors presented Atlanta's Kent Igleheart, named 2001 Clean Cities Coordinator of the Year, with his pick of the company's model year 2002 AFV offerings. And in the spirit of vehicle giveaways, American Honda also awarded Beverly Miller, Salt Lake City Clean Cities coordinator and last year 's Coordinator of the Year, a new CNG-powered Honda Civic GX.  The conference served alternative fuel interests of all ages and not just ""seasoned"" advocates. Nearly 600 local grade school students participated in Clean Cities' first-ever ""ScienceFest"" program, featuring General Motors' science advisor, Bill Nye, ""the Science Guy."" Students participated in a series of workshops on transportation, energy, natural resources, and the environment. They also formed teams of ""pollution busters"" and explored the AFV exhibits in the Expo Hall.  Westward Ho! Among the eagerly anticipated announcements at the Clean Cities Conference is always the site location and venue for the following year. At the coalition awards breakfast, with the help of a Native American tribal dancer, Zach Taylor, Executive Director of the Central Oklahoma Council of Governments, announced that the Eighth National Clean Cities Conference will be held in Oklahoma City, May 12-15, 2002. For details on the Seventh National Clean Cities Conference, including speaker presentations and sponsor lists, and for preliminary information about the 2002 Clean Cities Conference in Oklahoma City, please visit www. ccities.doe.gov/conference.shtml.  And the Winners Are... The Clean Cities Conference provides an excellent forum for the program to recognize the accomplishments of stakeholders and coalitions. On opening day, Tom Gross presented the Clean Cities National Partner Awards to organizations that have made significant contributions to the alternative fuels industry (see photo, back cover).  2001 Clean Cities National Partners  American Airlines  Denver International Airport's Terry Henry  Holiday Stationstores, Minnesota Corn Growers, Minnesota Department of Commerce-Energy Division  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority  New York State Clean Fueled Vehicles Council  Northside Independent School District  Schwan's Sales Enterprises  Waste Management For more on the 2001 Clean Cities National Partners, please visit www.ccities.doe.gov/pdfs/partner_awards_ 2001.pdf.  Igleheart Brings Outstanding Coordinator Award Home to Atlanta For his successful efforts to secure AFV project funding and strengthen stakeholder relations in the Clean CitiesAtlanta Coalition, Kent Igleheart received this year 's Outstanding Coordinator Award. Under Igleheart's leadership, the number of AFVs in and around Atlanta grew last year to more than 3,400. To meet the increased fueling demand, the coalition facilitated the addition of 7 CNG, 2 propane, and 3 biodiesel refueling stations, along with 66 electric recharging sites. Atlanta is home to nearly 200 AFV stations.  Select coalitions were also recognized at a special awards breakfast on the second day of the conference. Ten coalitions received awards for their accomplishments, which included adding the greatest number of AFVs, adding the most refueling stations, recruiting the largest number of private fleets, and leveraging the most funds for AFV projects. For more information about the coalition awards, see back cover.  Keys, Please Many Clean Cities coordinators have longed for a personal AFV to use on the job so that they may ""walk the talk."" Thanks to Clean Cities' generous auto company partners, a few surprised coordinators got their wish at the conference. DaimlerChrysler gave away a neighborhood electric vehicle at the coordinators' reception on Saturday night. Ford presented the keys to a dedicated natural gas van to the city of Philadelphia's Health and Fitness Czar, Gwen Foster. Toyota raised Monday's excitement to an electrifying level with the announcement of its vehicle giveaway--10 lucky coordinators received an electric RAV-4, complete with a charger, for one year.  Outstanding Coordinator Kent Igleheart of Atlanta was further honored by General Motors, receiving an AFV of his choice from GM.  Atlanta-area stakeholders now operate 180 compressed natural gas (CNG) transit buses, 374 CNG postal delivery vehicles, and 71 CNG taxis. In addition, Georgia Power operates a fleet of 315 electric vehicles. Looking to the future, Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority  7  NREL/PIX 10061   2001  CLEAN CITIES  CONFERENCE REPORT General Motors added to his recognition by presenting Igleheart with a 2002 model alternative fuel vehicle of his choice. In addition to his individual award, the Atlanta coalition was one of 10 winners of this year 's Clean Cities Coalition Awards.  (MARTA), Buckhead Shuttle, and Clayton, Gwinnett, and Cobb counties are committed to making the transition to alternative fuel buses. Igleheart is responsible for guiding the Atlanta coalition to non-profit status. ""Becoming a non-profit organization opened new avenues for additional funding,"" he said. ""As a non-profit, we enjoy more freedom in terms of the types of grants we're eligible for."" ""Our success in securing funds has allowed us to put a management contract in place that provides the equivalent of more than two full-time people to focus on fundraising, planning meetings and conferences, producing the coalition newsletter and Web site, and lots of other activities that simply wouldn't be possible otherwise,"" Igleheart said.  ""Super-Consumer"" John Davis Praises AFVs, Alternative Fuels John Davis is the producer and host of the weekly PBS program, MotorWeek. In more than 20 years in that role, Davis has applied the show's rigorous test and evaluation regimen to thousands of cars and trucks--always with the goal of considering vehicles purely from the perspective of the consumer.  Conference Panel Sheds Light on New Possibilities for AFV Funding Conference sessions included a variety of topics to help Clean Cities coalitions expand the AFV market. One panel discussion showcased an innovative scheme to help increase funding for projects according to the expected global emissions reduction benefits. In 1997, Oregon enacted the first meaningful statelevel legislative measure to control carbon dioxide (CO2). Like other so-called greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, CO2 is believed to cause ozone depletion, which contributes to global warming. The law requires utilities generating power in Oregon to ""avoid, sequester, or displace"" a portion of their CO2 emissions. One way to do so is to purchase credits, or ""carbon offsets,"" from qualified organizations launching emissions-reducing projects in Oregon or elsewhere. The Oregon plan is of particular interest to Clean Cities coalitions, regardless of their location, as a potential source of funding for AFV projects. By meeting specific requirements in terms of project structure and emissions monitoring, coalitions could receive grant money for projects that reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The plan is administered by the Climate Trust, an Oregon-based non-profit. One DUMMYpotential buyer is Seattle large CAPTION COPY Airport vehicles make up one utility that City Light, a public claims to have put $7 million on the table, earmarked for purchasing carbon credits. ""I want coalitions to hone their ability to sell their carbon dioxide emissions reductions to us,"" said Doug Howell, a strategic advisor with Seattle City Light. Howell is a founding member of the Puget Sound Clean Cities Coalition. His employer is seeking as many as four projects, to offset the equivalent of 247,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to Howell. Consideration will be given to projects designed to reduce not just CO2, but other greenhouse gases as well. The Oregon plan gives preference to-but does not require-projects based within the state. Acknowledging that causes and effects of ozone depletion are worldwide, the Oregon legislation honors emission-reducing efforts in other states, and even other nations. A request for proposals, explaining how to apply for consideration as a carbon-credit trading partner with Seattle City Light, is available at www.climatetrust.org. The solicitation is now closed to new proposals, but another is expected in January 2002. The site also offers general information about Oregon's carbon credit plan. The Climate Trust has an interest in purchasing carbon offsets, independent of the needs of Seattle City Light. At the direction of the National Energy Laboratory, Science Applications International Corporation has helped to produce a hypothetical sample project to illustrate how a project sponsor might qualify to earn carbon offsets under the Oregon plan and other similar trading systems. ""Developing International Greenhouse Gas Reduction Projects Using AFV Technologies"" is published on the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/pdfs/ jette_findsen.pdf.  Because ozone depletion occurs worldwide, Oregon recognizes emissions-reducing projects from outside the state.  8  Photodisc   2001  CLEAN CITIES  CONFERENCE REPORT gence Agency. An early advocate of biologically produced ethanol, he wrote extensively on the subject with Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) in Foreign Affairs magazine (Jan.Feb. 1999). Woolsey spoke of the benefits of biomass and biologically produced ethanol at Tuesday morning's ""Technology Forecast."" The session also included a broad discussion of hydrogen, fuel cells, and electric vehicles. Other participants were author Jim Motavelli, Robert Bienenfeld of American Honda, Bruce Gordon of Ford, Tom Gross of DOE, and Stan Ovshinsky of Energy Conversion Devices. Presently, most ethanol is produced from corn. But other sources, still mostly unexploited, could dramatically boost availability, Woolsey said. Biomass can be made from urban garbage and agricultural waste such as rice straw. In many parts of the world, rice straw is pulled out of the fields and burned as waste, which produces harmful carbon dioxide emissions.  ""Think of me as the super-consumer,"" Davis said in an interview preceding his participation in a Monday afternoon session. Davis led ""The Right Fit for Light Duty Vehicles: Product Roll-out."" Also on the panel were representatives of American Honda, Daimler-Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Toyota. As a concept, AFVs have an enormous potential appeal to American consumers, Davis said. Rising petroleum prices and the energy crisis in California have broadened interest in alternatives. The success of hybrid vehicles, while not classified as AFVs under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, proves people are willing to try something new. Early adopters tend to be fleet managers, he said, ""because they exist solely to save money."" Gains in operating efficiency are already enough to satisfy fleets, and the public will be quick to follow. Davis is optimistic about the spread of alternative fuels and hybrid technology to many more vehicle platforms, including sport-utility vehicles and pickups. ""When the powertrains start to make sense for more Americans, the market will explode,"" he said. John Davis  James Woolsey  Alternative fuels may still suffer from an identity crisis, however. ""Ask somebody what alternative fuels are, and they're likely to say electricity or diesel,"" he said. Compressed natural gas (CNG) remains a mystery to most motorists, even with availability in nearly all urban areas. A key to penetrating the mainstream market, he said, may be selling AFVs as the ""second car"" in a household. A family might consider a CNG-powered car if its other, conventionally fueled vehicle can be counted on for crosscountry travel, late-night fueling, etc. ""I'm a natural gas advocate, and have been for a long time,"" said Davis. A long-time muscle car enthusiast, Davis has owned a variety of vintage Mustangs, Corvettes, and a deTomaso Pantera. Such gasoline-thirsty vehicles deserve a place on the road, he insists, along with more fuel-efficient ""daily drivers."" But like all motorists, their owners have an obligation to keep such cars maintained and well-tuned. ""When I see somebody coming down the road belching smoke,"" he said, "" I want to make a citizen's arrest.""  Abundant ethanol could effectively ""stretch"" petroleum supplies, Woolsey argued. A decentralized network of ethanol producers might boost the use of flexible-fuel vehicles, running on gasoline when necessary and E85 when possible. Constructing a pipeline infrastructure would be unnecessary. Some major oil companies have a benign view of renewable energy sources such as ethanol, noted Woolsey. Others think of renewables as ""the work of the devil."" Big ethanol producers, meanwhile, are slow to change and ""acting like IBM did when silicon chips were invented,"" he said. Ethanol producers might lose out if they don't recognize the importance of new, renewable feedstocks. Hydrogen was discussed by Ovshinksy, CEO of Energy Conversion Devices. The company is developing a means to deploy hydrogen fuel as a solid, not a liquid. The method would reduce safety concerns, but it is still a long way from economic feasibility, Ovshinksy said. Electric vehicles are widely thought of as ""zero-emissions,"" he noted. But if they are recharged with electricity generated by burning fossil fuels, they are merely ""a way for L.A. to export its CO2 emissions, and they don't do anything for global warming."" Similarly, many fuels are considered potential feedstocks to create hydrogen, noted Bienenfeld of American Honda. But if petroleum emerges as dominant, ""fuel cells by themselves won't accomplish anything,"" he said.  Former CIA Chief Woolsey Touts Biomass Ethanol for Energy Security A big boost for ethanol-powered vehicles might come from ideas promoted by James Woolsey, a partner in the environmental law firm of Shea and Gardner. Woolsey's expertise in energy stems from his involvement in international security, as former director of the Central Intelli-  9   subscribers to drive. As such, individuals can avoid the cost of owning a vehicle and still maintain comparable mobility. Says Atlanta's Kent Igleheart (recently named Clean Cities Coordinator of the Year), ""I really feel that station cars will be the next big thing in transportation. A big problem with public transit is the lack of mobility once you arrive at the station--what if your work is too far from a station? What if you have an emergency? This concept addresses many of these issues."" What's more, the environment will benefit as much as any traffic-weary commuter--to date, most station cars have been zero emission vehicles such as Ford's TH!NK electric vehicle. In fact, a recent study of the San Francisco Bay Area Initial Station Car Demonstration confirmed greater than 90% reduction of emissions including carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compounds. And in the not-too distant future, station cars will take advantage of state-of-the-art electronics to simplify the system for all involved. Customers need not worry about typical rental car inconveniences such as adjusting the seats, filing out paperwork, or even setting the radio, as these tasks and more will be controlled by user-specific ID cards. Advanced docking systems will automatically recharge the automobiles once parked and line them up accordingly to ensure that a fully charged vehicle is always available. Furthermore, these automated systems will park the cars as close together as possible, conserving valuable land around transit stations. The success of pilot programs (see box) has significantly increased interest in the station car concept. To help build momentum, Clean Earth Action in Atlanta hosted the first annual Station Car Conference in April, providing a forum for station car proponents to discuss ways to increase recognition and improve viability of the concept. With continued promotion, individuals across the nation will have the opportunity to benefit from the station cars' convenience and affordability. As a result, communities nationwide could enjoy decreased traffic, pollution, and cost.  . . . And One forEnhance All Station Cars Positioned to Mass Transit Experience As our nation's population swells, city dwellers are finding themselves afflicted by the evils of pollution, traffic, and high costs of living. Yet they shrug their shoulders when asked the question: ""Why don't you take the train?"" The expanded use of mass transit can help alleviate congestion and commuter woes. Unfortunately, many cringe at thoughts of riding the bus or the train because they envision long waits, crowded vehicles, and general inconvenience. And what if the destination is beyond walking distance from a transit station? Rather than deal with these issues, most Americans opt for personal transportation, thereby contributing to the very problems that inundate their already stressful urban lives. The station car concept has surfaced as a potential alternative. Once fully developed, this new genre of transportation will offer the same mobility, convenience and comfort of privately owned vehicles while providing the economical and environmental benefits of mass transit. It can offer the best of both worlds. As with car sharing, a similar system that originated in Europe, the station car concept is motivated by the idea that mobility should not necessarily require the high cost of owning a vehicle. By obtaining membership to a station car provider or service, one can gain access to any of a large inventory of cars positioned at transit stations and other central locations. The cars are available for local trips, including going to work or home. Cars that are not in use (when the driver is at work, for example) are free for other   Seattle's Flexcar already has some 1,300 members using its 42-vehicle fleet.

On June 15, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed Senate Bill 5 (SB5), creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP)--and a $126 million annual incentive program for lower emission light- and heavyduty vehicles. The program takes effect September 1, 2001. The TERP Fund, which will pay for the program, will draw from state registration fees for truck trailers and commercial vehicles, state motor vehicle inspections and new registrations, and state-issued construction equipment charges. Modeled after California's Carl Moyer Program, the heavy-duty vehicle portion of the legislation seeks to reduce diesel emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the nonattainment areas of Texas. Approximately $90 million in grants will be available for on- and off-road heavy-duty alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) purchases, vehicle repower projects, purchases of emissionsreducing add-on equipment (such as auxiliary power units), and alternative fuel infrastructure projects. ""Everybody down here is quite excited about the opportunities this legislation could bring, especially for heavyduty projects,"" said DOE's Dan Deaton, Clean Cities Regional Manager. ""Many of our cities--Laredo, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas--are experiencing more heavy-duty truck traffic because of increased trade with Mexico. This legislation will help develop clean corridor projects. It's really a positive shot in the arm for all of the Clean Cities coalitions in Texas,"" he said. DOE is working with NREL, the Clean Cities Tiger Teams, and the Texas Clean Cities to host a series of workshops this fall to help inform fleets of the unique opportunities afforded by the legislation. How did Texas AFV advocates create such a strong incentives program--and get it passed? According to Tommy Foltz, Vice President of Government Affairs for Blue Energy & Technology, it took broad-based support and a little legislative know-how. Blue Energy and its Texas subsidiary, TranStar Energy, together with Gladstein & Associates (which has worked extensively with fleets on California's Carl Moyer Program) first proposed the idea at the 2000 National Clean Cities Conference in San Diego. They joined forces with vehicle and equipment manufacturers, such as Power Systems Associates, Pressed Steel, Ford Motor Company, and American Honda, and formed the Texas Campaign for Clean Transportation (TCCT) to develop and promote the incentives program.  TE X  A  S  Approximately $13 million will also be available to reimburse fleets for new heavy-duty engine purchases-- but incentive funding will depend on the amount of NOx emissions produced. For example, in the program's first year, vehicles emitting 2.5 grams of NOx per brake horsepower-hour (g/bhp-hr) can qualify for a $15,000 incentive, and vehicles producing 1.5 g/bhp-hr or less can qualify for as much as $25,000. The standards will rise for engines produced in model years 2003 through 2006. The same rule applies to the light-duty vehicle portion of the legislation--the cleaner the vehicle, the greater the incentive. The TERP Fund will provide more than $23 million for light-duty vehicle incentives. To qualify for the funds, vehicles must meet the emission standards of the top four ""bins"" in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Tier 2 system; incentives will range from as much as $5,000 per vehicle to $1,250 per vehicle. According to the legislation, all new car dealerships and leasing agents will carry lists of the vehicles eligible for incentives. For more on Tier 2 emission standards, please visit www.epa.gov/ oms/tr2home.htm.  TCCT members met with legislators, including the bill's champions, State Senator J.E. ""Buster"" Brown of Houston and State Representative Steven Wolens of Dallas. They answered questions and distributed literature. They also won over the Texas construction industry, which, despite the prospect of financially supporting the incentives program, backed SB5 because it lifted a ban that limited construction operations to certain hours of the day. According to Foltz, it's never too early start working the legislative process. "" State legislators have limited time once their session begins and there are so many issues in front of them. It's important to get them the information they need--early. If there's anything I can say about the process, it's get in there early, and often.""

Among the most prominent is the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). With 17,000 pieces of equipment, including on-road vehicles, off-road vehicles, and nonmotorized trailers, TxDOT operates one of the nation's largest fleets. Of its 9,000 on-road vehicles, 6,000 are AFVs. But what's most impressive about this state fleet is that its AFVs, which are a variety of bifuel natural gas and propane vehicles, consume about five million gallons of alternative fuel each year. Although TxDOT must comply with both federal and state AFV acquisition mandates--for the past 10 years, Texas has required its state fleets to purchase only AFVs-- neither regulation requires actual alternative fuel use. An internal organization policy encourages drivers to use alternative fuel whenever possible and TxDOT does not place its AFVs where alternative fuel is unavailable. But the fleet's success was not achieved overnight. At first, customer and driver reluctance to embrace the new technology posed problems. Part of the solution, according to fleet manager Don Lewis, was training--and lots of it. ""We established new employee training courses and `train the trainer ' courses to help alternative fuels become mainstream,"" he said.  TxDOT also worked at the regional level to help ensure alternative fuel use. ""We went to the top people in our 25 districts throughout the state and tied alternative fuel use to their performance measures,"" said Lewis. ""The head of each district now has a personal stake in ensuring as much alternative fuel use as possible, and we're averaging more than 80% utilization."" TxDOT does not own or operate private natural gas fueling stations. Most of its natural gas vehicles operate in and around Dallas and Houston and refuel at commercial stations, helping to ensure the viability of each region's extensive refueling infrastructure. About half of TxDOT's propane vehicle drivers service at commercial stations, while the other half refuels at TxDOT facilities. To help promote the increased use of alternative fuel and spread the word throughout the communities it serves, TxDOT staff members meet frequently with local governments and participate in each of the state's six Clean Cities coalitions. Each of the TxDOT vehicles also displays a bumper sticker to let others know it uses a clean, domestically produced alternative fuel. ""[Alternative fuel use] is not as tough as it seems--the manufacturers are producing the vehicles and the fuel industry has been very supportive,"" said Lewis. ""Today we face fewer challenges...using alternative fuel is just a way of life for us now."" State fleets interested in learning more about TxDOT are encouraged to call Don Lewis at 512-416-2085.  Nevada's Bio Bug Makes Cross Country Journey What better way to show support for AFVs than to drive one 3,000 miles to the National Clean Cities Conference and Expo? That's what the Nevada State Motor Pool did with its Bio Bug, a Volkswagen Beetle powered by biodiesel. Powered by a truly homegrown fuel, the Bio Bug used biodiesel made exclusively from recycled cooking oil collected from the MGM Grand Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada and produced by Biodiesel Industries, Inc. Drivers carried with them buckets of the Nevada-made biodiesel (B100), which they mixed with conventional diesel to create B20.  The BioBug began its cross-country journey in Carson City, Nevada. From left: Norma McCusker, Western Energetix; Jason Geddes, Nevada Department of Agriculture; Adele Malone, Nevada Department of Environmental Protection; Jim Brandmueller, Nevada Energy Office; and Linda Obrien, Washoe County Health Department.  Before departing on its clean, cross country journey, the Bio Bug was on display for Nevada state legislators as part of an outreach event coordinated by the Truckee Meadows Clean Cities Coalition. Keith Wells of the Nevada State Motor Pool drove the first leg of the trip from Reno, Nevada to Philadelphia. Making stops in Utah, Colorado, Missouri, and Kentucky, Wells reported achieving 45 miles per gallon. For three  days, the colorfully decorated vehicle joined other AFVs on display in the Expo Hall at the Clean Cities Conference. Frank Revell, also from the Nevada State Motor Pool, drove on the return trip, with stops in Tennessee and Texas.

Attendees often eagerly await National Partner and Clean Cities Coalition award presentations, but it's the announcement of State Energy Program (SEP) Special Projects grant recipients that always keeps coalition coordinators at the edge of their seats. Each year, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offers funds to designated Clean Cities coalitions through the SEP grant program. This year, coalitions submitted nearly 130 proposals seeking funds for alternative fuel niche marSEP Grant Amounts ket development projects, by Project Type alternative fuel infrastrucNiche markets $1,890,448 ture, alternative fuel Infrastructure 1,486,285 school buses, training, and School buses 487,147 Clean Cities coordinator Training 225,365 positions. Coordinators 357,286 DOE awarded more Total $4,446,531 than $4.4 million to 54 projects in 25 states, including the District of Columbia, but what's more, the estimated cost-share from the funded projects is more than $40 million, or ten times the federal investment. For more information on which projects were funded, please visit the Clean Cities Web site at www.ccities.doe.gov/sep_ winners.shtml. Nearly half of the proposals submitted sought funds for natural gas projects--among the winners is Sysco Food Services of Houston. A member of the Greater Houston Clean Cities Coalition, Sysco received two grants for a total of $350,000. The funds will help the company convert 15 of its heavy-duty distribution trucks to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and build an LNG refueling site in Houston. Following in the footsteps of Clean Cities National Partner, H.E.B. Foods, also based in Texas, Sysco plans to eventually convert all 130 of its trucks to LNG. According to Gary Cullen, Vice President of Operations, the company decided to pursue alternative fuels because Houston suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the country. ""It's the right thing to do,"" said Cullen. ""We want to use alternative fuels to do our part to clean the air and conserve petroleum products, and we think we can do that without sacrificing service to our customers.""  Clean Cities International News New Delhi: A Hot Climate--and Now the Hottest Market for NGVs The Indian government has enacted tough, progressive air quality polices in New Delhi in an effort to help the city lose its distinction as one of the top ten most polluted regions of the world. On March 31, 2001 an India Supreme Court ruling took effect, requiring the entire New Delhi bus fleet, as well as other public transport vehicles, to convert from diesel to compressed natural gas. In all, the volume of vehicles slated for conversion is enormous--12,000 buses and 9,000 taxis, in addition to numerous auto rickshaws that ply the streets. As for refueling, 65 of the expected 90 to 120 ""daughter stations"" have been completed. Unfortunately, not all of the lines leading from the natural gas pipeline are operating--drivers must wait hours for fuel that is delivered in cascade cylinders. And unlike U.S. buses, CNG tanks are placed below the bus floors; ""spurious"" cylinders have caused tragic accidents. ""The Indians need U.S. product and they need help with training,"" said Clean Cities Program Deputy Director Marcy Rood. ""Crucial safety standards and training are not yet in place,"" she said. According to Rood, success of the natural gas industry in New Delhi is critical not just for the local effort, but also because it could affect upcoming decisions in other Indian cities currently considering alternative fuels. Repercussions of a failed program could also negatively affect the global natural gas market, she said. In April, the Department of Energy's Clean Cities Program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency led a delegation to India's first alternative fuels conference, sponsored by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and the Central Pollution Control Board. According to Rood, the Indians greeted them enthusiastically and greatly appreciated the information the group presented. The delegation's future plans include establishing a much-needed ""train the trainer"" program, with help from the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium.

The checkered flags waved on June 13, as fifteen university teams and their ""future trucks"" powered past the finish line at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in Washington, DC. The event culminated many months of hard work (or as one student put it, ""blood, sweat, and tears"") involved in the 2001 FutureTruck competition. In the 2001 FutureTruck competition, co-sponsored by DOE and General Motors, students from the United States and Canada used hybrid design strategies, alternative fuels, and other advanced technologies including fuel cells, to reengineer Chevrolet Suburbans--all part of a quest to create the cleanest, greenest, most fuel-efficient sport utility vehicle. Each FutureTruck vehicle underwent a more than a week of rigorous emissions, design, and performance testing at the General Motors Proving Ground in Michigan, before the teams drove to Washington for the finish line festivities. In one of his first appearances as DOE's new Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, David Garman welcomed the FutureTruck teams to the finish in Washington. The parade of vehicles then proceeded to a display on Capitol Hill, where the students shared their work with more than twenty members of Congress, as well as Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham. Competition awards were announced at an evening ceremony held at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The University of California at Davis captured first place in the overall competition. UC-Davis' achievements included a 42% improvement in the EPA adjusted combined-cycle fuel economy (19.09 mpg vs. 13.46 mpg for the stock Suburban); and emissions equivalent to that of a certified ultra low emission vehicle (ULEV) and accelation comparable to the stock vehicle. Efforts to reduce weight and aerodynamic drag contributed to the  GM's Ed Koerner; Bill Nye, ""the Science Guy;"" DOE's David Garman; and Robert Webb, representing the Canadian Embassy, each waved a checkered flag as FutureTruck teams crossed the finish line.  team's success. The University of Wisconsin, which placed second with its ""Moolenium"" vehicle, achieved 28 miles per gallon equivalent in the on-road fuel economy test--a 62% improvement over the stock Suburban (17.3 mpg). The Moolenium's emission score, however, kept Wisconsin from taking first place. More than 30 awards were presented in a variety of categories including best use of advanced materials, achieved by the University of Wisconsin, and best use of advanced technologies, presented to Michigan Tech. For a detailed list of award winners and more information on FutureTruck, please visit www.futuretruck.org.  Pickens Fuel Wins Blue Sky Award Pickens Fuel Corp. was awarded this year 's Blue Sky Award by WestStart, a California-based, advanced transportation organization. The award recognizes outstanding marketplace contributions to advanced clean transportation and efforts to get more AFVs on the road. Pickens was honored for its commitment to helping fleets affordably convert to alternative fuels. The company has developed an economic business model that links a natural gas fueling station to an ""anchor"" tenant with a high fuel-use fleet. This model helps to amortize fixed costs and build economically viable stations.  Clean Air Excellence Awards Program EPA has launched its second annual Awards Program honoring outstanding, innovative efforts that support progress in achieving cleaner air. Award categories include the following: Clean Air Technology, Community Development/Re-Development, Education/Outreach, Regulatory/ Policy Innovations, Transportation Efficiency Innovations, and Outstanding Individual Achievement.

Members of the Ohio State University team met with Senator George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the FutureTruck display on Capitol Hill on June 13.  14   From the Automakers California Fuel Cell Partnership Shoots for 70 FCVs by 2003 Launched to advance fuel cell technologies as an environmentally friendly solution to pollution and America's dependence on foreign oil, the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CFCP) labels itself ""a unique collaborative of auto manufacturers, oil companies, a fuel cell company, and the state of California."" The association's more than 25 partners range from industry to government. They include DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, American Honda, and Volkswagen; BP, Shell, and Texaco; Ballard Power Systems and XCELLSiS; and the Department of Energy and the California Air Resources Board. Its associate partners include AC Transit, SunLine Transit Agency, and Pacific Gas & Electric. With a goal of placing 70 demonstration fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) on the road by 2003, the 2-year-old group has structured this objective into three one-year phases. Phase I, which ended in 2000, consisted of planning and project development, and partner additions and facilities preparation. Phase II, which will end in 2001, includes the demonstration of hydrogen fueled passenger cars and transit buses and the building and management of a hydrogen refueling station in West Sacramento. During the final phase, from 2002-03, manufacturers will demonstrate more than 50 passenger cars using hydrogen, methanol and a petroleum based fuel, and transit agencies will demonstrate 20 hydrogen buses. The vehicles will look and perform like traditional vehicles, says the partnership's Web site at www.drivingthe future.org. The only difference is that they will emit zero to near-zero emissions and show increased fuel efficiency. CFCP also promises the vehicles will offer lower maintenance costs, an impressive driving range, a vibration-free ride, and ample power to run entertainment features, such as global positioning systems and Internet connections. ""Quantum Technologies is recognized as the industry leader in hydrogen storage and handling for automotive applications,"" said Larry Burns, GM vice president for research and development, and planning. ""We've had a long relationship with Quantum in the alternative fuels field. This agreement will enable our two companies to work together on bringing fuel cell vehicles to the market. It is a logical next step on the long road to a hydrogenbased economy."" In April, Quantum announced that it has developed of a compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel system for GM's first Chevrolet Zafira, a compact van manufactured at GM's Thailand Assembly Center. The Zafira is powered with clean CNG and equipped with a 1.8 liter, 115 hp engine.  ""Automatic"" Insight Now Available Hybrid electric vehicles are gaining popularity-- automakers continue to report record sales. And now car buyers who prefer automatic transmissions now have a new hybrid option. Honda recently announced the availability of an Insight model featuring a continuously variable transmission (CVT), which eliminates the need to manually shift gears.  Honda Insight  According to Honda, the CVT model allows drivers the convenience of an automatic transmission while still providing ""the fuel efficiency benefits and snappy performance of a manual transmission."" Although it's not quite as fuel efficient as its manually driven counterpart, the Insight CVT still achieves 57 miles per gallon in the city and 56 miles per gallon in highway driving. It also has the idle-stop feature that allows drivers to save gas while idling in traffic or stopped at a red light. The engine automatically restarts when the driver removes his or her foot from the brake pedal. Certified to California's super ultra low emission standard, the Insight CVT emits 96 percent less pollutants than a typical car. A hybrid-electric Civic model is planned for 2003. For more on the Insight, check out www.honda.com.  GM Takes an Interest in Quantum General Motors says it is taking a ""substantial minority stake"" in Quantum Technologies, a subsidiary of alternative fuels developer IMPCO, as part of a deal to develop hydrogen technology for fuel-cell powered vehicles. The deal will facilitate development of hydrogen storage and handling, and electronic control technologies.  15  American Honda   Alternative Fuels Data Center National Renewable Energy Laboratory 1617 Cole Blvd., MS/1633 Golden, CO 80401-3393  Award Winners Clean Cities Coalition Awards At this year 's Clean Cities Conference in Philadelphia, DOE's Tom Gross, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technologies, presented 10 coalitions with awards to recognize their outstanding achievements.

September 2003     Green Cars Start Their Engines Numerous automakers, as well as a few tinkerers, showcased 100 environmentally friendly cars and trucks at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. The vehicles, including plug-in electrics, hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and diesels, were put through testing for this eco-vehicle gathering. Japanese automakers are focusing on hybrids, and American manufacturers are promoting vehicles that would replace the internal combustion engine with fuel cells. European carmakers are focusing on diesel engines.         The vehicles were tested on drive by noise, fuel efficiency, exhaust emissions, acceleration, braking, slalom driving, and fuel efficiency. The friendly competition included an individual who spent $5,000 to convert a pickup truck to run on hydrogen, natural gas, propane, and gasoline, as well as any combination. Test drives of futuristic fuel cell prototypes were also offered.      Innovative Transit Bus Focuses on the Future The   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  is collaborating with other government agencies and the automotive industry to develop a bus that is designed to capture the nostalgia and appeal of the buses driven in Yellowstone National Park in the 1930s. The new yellow bus carries 16 to 32 passengers, can use an alternative fuel, features a low floor, and complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act.    The bus is built on a General Motors T-560 medium-duty chassis with a gross vehicle weight of 19,000-26,000 pounds. It took three years to design and build. Instead of conventional shocks, the bus rides on compressed air, which is released to lower the bus for boarding. It is designed to run on natural gas. Eventually, similar buses will be manufactured using several optional engines, to allow use of alternative fuels like natural gas, propane, ethanol, and biodiesel. Its purposes are to protect the national park's pristine environment and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.    August    2003     Pump Lets Natural Gas Civics Go to Market In 2004 Honda will begin mass-marketing natural gas-powered Civics that will come with a device to fill the tank in a garage. This is the first time an automaker will sell a natural gas vehicle broadly to the public. Until now, sales have been mostly limited to specialized fleets such as airport vans and university campus vehicles. Since 1998, Honda has sold 500 to 1,000 natural gas Civic GX models per year to customers such as the New York Department of Transportation. They are popular for commercial fleets that travel short distances and have their own filling stations. The drawback to widespread sales has been the lack of an easy, reliable way to fuel the vehicles. Honda will sell an appliance, called Phill, with each Civic GX to fill the tank from a home gas line. Phill will cost $2,000, but tax credits may knock the end cost down to $1,000. The Civic GX will cost about $20,000. Honda views the market as mostly second and commuter cars.   Phill, made by Toronto-based Fuelmaker, requires 8 hours to half-fill a vehicle, good for 100 miles. GX owners also can refill at approximately 1,300 natural gas stations nationwide. Filling stations that dispense compressed natural gas under pressure can fill a tank in three to five minutes.Running a vehicle on natural gas historically costs about 80% of what it costs to run on gasoline.  Honda views natural gas as a critical bridge to acceptance of hydrogen-powered vehicles it expects to sell in large numbers by 2015. By putting Phills in garages, Honda hopes people will accept the idea of hydrogen fuel cell generators in their garages later. Compared with gasoline, natural gas emits 70% less carbon monoxide, 87% less nitrogen oxide, and 20% less carbon dioxide.      Regional Transportation Center Opens in San Diego The Regional Transportation Center (RTC), the world's first, most advanced and most  comprehensive showcase of alternative fuels and alternative fuel the vehicles, has opened in San Diego.      The $15 million, 92,000-square-foot facility reflects a high-tech feel of the 21st century, while its subtle design elements recall the golden age of motoring in the 1950s. The state-of-the-art facilityfeatures the RTC Fuel Depot, offering an unprecedented nine types of fuel (six alternative), an Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Sales Showroom, Service Center and Rental Center as well as the RTC Education Center, run by the nonprofit San Diego Environmental Foundation and designed to educate people about the benefits of AFVs and a clean environment. In addition, the RTC is the first southern California dealership for the Segway(TM) Human Transporter, the world's first self-balancing, electric-powered transportation device.      Designed to efficiently accommodate the fueling requirements of AFVs and conventional automobiles, the RTC Fuel Depot offers liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol (E-85), biodiesel, compressed natural gas, electricity, ultra low-sulfur diesel, and three standard grades of gasoline. Many of the fuels are dispensed from futuristic, 10-foot-tall ""Eclipse"" pumps. In addition, motorists get the ""white glove"" full service treatment at no charge from service attendants dressed in 1950s era uniforms who are eager to assist with air, water, and window cleaning services. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the RTC Fuel Depot accepts all major credit, debit, and Voyager cards, and cash.      The RTC's signature structure is the AFV Sales Showroom, a stunning example of modern, state-of-the-art automobile showroom design that showcases Ford Motor Company's complete line of AFVs. Complementing the showroom is the AFV Rental Center and the AFV Service Center.      The RTC is also the first Segway HT dealership in Southern California. The Segway HT is the first self-balancing, electric transportation device designed for short-distance travel. The RTC Education Center is designed to educate middle and high school students about innovativetechnologies that will improve the environment.       The RTC has received financial support from Pearson Ford, Ford Motor Company, U.S. Department of Energy, County of San Diego, California Air Resources Board, City of San Diego via a HUD grant, Mutual Propane, and Clean Energy.

Veneman announced key revisions to the Bioenergy Program to expand industrial consumption of agricultural commodities by promoting their use in the production of ethanol and biodiesel. Sign-up for the program will begin May 7 and end June 6. Any bioenergy producer who expects to have eligible production between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003, must enroll in the program during this signup period.       The program will promote sustained increases in bioenergy production and related industrial agricultural commodities, and will help improve the environment. Under the program, the Secretary of Agriculture makes payments through the Commodity Credit Corporation to eligible producers to encourage increased purchases of eligible commodities (energy feedstocks) for the purpose of expanding production of bioenergy and supporting new production capacity. Payments to eligible producers are based on the increase in quantity of bioenergy they produce during a fiscal year over the quantity they produced during the preceding fiscal year.

Mayor Rocky Anderson Receives EPA Climate Protection Award Mayor Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City received the EPA Climate Protection Award, recognizing unprecedented efforts to slow global warming. Salt Lake City is the only municipality being recognized for its efforts, on a local level, to set an example for other cities. It is taking concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and health-endangering air pollutants. Mayor Anderson has spearheaded a broad range of cost-effective, innovative initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and has leveraged the international spotlight to draw attention to this issue.    The EPA nominated Anderson because of his commitment, announced early in 2002, to reduce greenhouse gases to 7% below 1990 levels by 2012. Salt Lake City now has a comprehensive Local Climate Action Plan, which involves actions in transportation, energy, waste, and forestry. Some actions are well underway, including the installation of 861 LED traffic signals; switching of airport ground service equipment to biodiesel; and an initiative to convert city fleets to 100% alternative fuel vehicles. A broad-based stakeholder group known as the Green Team, which includes representatives from city/state agencies, industry, academia, and environmental groups, is helping to develop this plan and guide its implementation.      GM, BMW to Develop Hydrogen Fueling Technology GM and the BMW Group will work together to develop fueling technology for liquid hydrogen vehicles and will invite other automakers and suppliers to join them. GM said BMW is an ideal partner because the German automaker has done extensive research on liquid hydrogen.  Every major automaker is working on hydrogen-powered vehicles, most with fuel cells. GM and BMW say their goal is to have affordable and compelling hydrogen vehicles for sale by 2010. A key to meeting that goal is developing ways to store and handle the fuel easily.  Compressed and liquid hydrogen both hold promise for hydrogen-powered vehicles, but liquid hydrogen's density is especially attractive with respect to fuel distribution. The collaborative work will center around setting global standards for fueling equipment, both on vehicles and at retail locations, and establishing specifications for suppliers.      Fuel Cell Vehicles to Number 800,000 by 2012 The number of FCVs that will be introduced to the world in the coming decade will reach 800,000 by 2012, according to a new study by Allied Business Intelligence. FCVs will contribute critical knowledge for early rollouts in niche markets in the second half of this decade, according to the study. ABI believes that greater attention is finally being given to fuel cells, and there is as much awareness in the European Union as there is in Japan. The United States will have to more aggressively execute its strategy of solving technological challenges and infrastructure layouts if it is to help early FCV introduction by the second half of the decade.  ABI has updated its forecasts for FCV shipments and its analysis of the changing global fuel cell business environment. The study exposes regional characteristics of the automotive fuel cell sector and outlines a timeline for potential fuel cell penetration in the next 10 years.     Abraham Calls for International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy At the International Energy Agency Ministerial meeting, DOE Secretary Abraham called for an international collaboration in advanced R&D that will support the deployment of hydrogen energy technologies. A growing number of countries have committed to accelerate the development of hydrogen energy technologies to improve their energy, economic, and environmental security. The United States has committed $1.7 billion for the first five years of a long-term R&D program for hydrogen, hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cells, and hybrid vehicle technologies. The European Union has committed up to 2 billion Euros to long-term R&D of renewable and hydrogen energy technologies.   January   2003     Bush Announces Hydrogen Initiative President Bush announced a $1.2 billion  hydrogen initiative  during his State of the Union address. The initiative will include $720 million in new funding over the next five years to develop the technologies and infrastructure needed to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles and to generate electricity.  The initiative complements the President's FreedomCAR initiative, which is developing technologies needed to mass produce safe and affordable hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Through partnerships with industry, these two initiatives seek to make these vehicles cost effective for large numbers of Americans by 2020.                  The new hydrogen initiative and FreedomCAR will dramatically improve America's energy security by significantly reducing the need for imported oil, and are key components of the President's clean air and climate change strategies.  For more information about hydrogen technologies, see the   National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap .     Ethanol Workshop to be Held in California The National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, the American Coalition for Ethanol, the Nebraska Ethanol Board, and the Clean Fuels Development Coalition are cosponsoring a workshop titled, Ethanol in California: Opportunities for Increased Utilization and Production, on February 6, 2003 at the Radisson Hotel in Sacramento, California. The workshop will provide information on the possibilities for ethanol production in California. The workshop will focus on the various forms of ethanol available to Californians that can have a positive impact on air quality and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several other workshops are planned within the next two years at various locations. Register for this event at the  Clean Fuels Development Coalition  Web site or the  American Coalition for Ethanol  site.     Ford Agrees to Sell Think Nordic to Kamkorp Microelectronics Ford Motor Company signed a letter of intent in late December to sell Think Nordic, the Norwegian part of its EV business, to Kamkorp Microelectronics of Switzerland. The agreement will save 100 jobs at the Think Nordic plant in Aurskog, Norway. Ford announced in late August 2002 that it was abandoning its TH!NK brand of battery-powered EVs, focusing instead on developing hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. As part of the agreement, Kamkorp will also acquire the rights to the TH!NK and city brand names developed by Ford. Ford acquired the Norwegian plant in 1999, when it was operating under the PIVCO name.     Nissan Unveils UTC Fuel Cells A Nissan X-TRAIL FCV fuel cell vehicle powered by a UTC Fuel Cells (UTCFC) hydrogen power plant was the first produced under agreements signed between Nissan and UTCFC to develop fuel cells and fuel cell components for vehicles.  The zero-emission X-TRAIL FCV, a hybrid vehicle that draws its primary power from a 75-kW UTCFC ambient pressure fuel cell power plant, is fueled by compressed hydrogen. Nissan intends to start public road testing of the vehicle in Japan.  UTCFC is also developing fuel cells for the fleet vehicle market with partners Irisbus of Europe and Thor Industries of the United States. A Thor Industries' bus powered by a 75-kW fuel cell power plant unit entered passenger service in November with Sunline Transit Agency.     General Motors to Offer Hybrid Vehicles GM will offer hybrid options on several vehicles, starting later this year with the GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups for use in commercial fleets. The hybrid versions of the trucks will increase fuel economy by 10% to 12%. The vehicles will be publicly available in 2004.  Depending on demand, GM may produce a million or more a year by 2007. In 2005, GM will begin producing a hybrid Saturn VUE sport utility. It will also include a hybrid option on its Chevy Equinox SUV in 2006 and its Chevy Malibu sedan in 2007. Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler also plan hybrid models.  Buyers in some areas qualify for a federal tax deduction and local tax breaks. Even though a hybrid could cost $4,000 more than a conventional vehicle, an owner could save nearly $5,500 in gasoline expenses over the vehicle's driving life.                                                    | Vehicle Buyer's Guide | Consumer Buyer's Guide | Fleet Buyer's Guide |    [ DOE ] [ Clean Cities ] [ OWIP ] [ FCVT ] [ Webmaster ]  [ Security and Privacy Notices ]"

D E P A R T M E N T o f  ENERGY  An Official Publication of the Clean Cities Network and the Alternative Fuels Data Center From the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy  Alternative Fuel School Buses Earn High Marks  PLUS: Biodiesel Expands Availability National AFV Day  INSIDE:  AFVs for '02   D  ear Readers,  For nearly eight years, Clean Cities stakeholders have rallied behind the notion that we must increase the use of alternative fuel to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil and strengthen our national energy security. I think it's accurate to conclude that for eight years, building a national, sustainable market for alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles has been an uphill climb. After the events of September 11, our call to action has never been more urgent, our cause has never been more important, and our success has never been more critical. Oil is one of the cornerstones of our economy and our national security. Our country now depends on other nations for 56 percent of the oil we use. What's more, transportation accounts for about two-thirds of the oil we consume. How's that for an Achilles Heel? This situation leaves our economy dangerously vulnerable to price shocks, and the potential for supply disruptions influences our options while we respond to terror. Increasing the use of domestically produced, clean alternative fuels in our vehicles is not the sole solution, but it is an important part of our nation's overall security strategy. As Clean Cities stakeholders, you understand this, and you are demonstrating the important role that alternative fuels can play in our transportation system. In this issue of Alternative Fuel News, we feature many of your efforts to build alternative fuel niche markets and highlight particular efforts to increase the use of a homegrown, renewable fuel--biodiesel. Thank you for your hard work, resolve, and continued commitments to increase the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. Best wishes, and as usual, enjoy the issue.

The story stated that greenhouse gas emissions are believed to ""cause ozone depletion, which contributes to global warming."" The statement is inaccurate. It should have said that such gases increase the so-called ""greenhouse effect"" on the atmosphere, which is widely known as global warming. Ozone depletion is a separate issue.  3   Alternative Fuel School Buses Earn High Marks So how do schools ensure a safe, clean environment? Power buses with alternative fuels, say the authors. The report suggests, ""alternative fuel technologies represent the cleanest available options for heavy-duty applications,"" and recommends that alternative fuel buses ""play an integral part in our emission-reduction strategy."" INFORM, a New York-based nonprofit organization, agrees. INFORM examined nine major emission studies comparing conventional diesel buses with natural gas buses and published its findings in ""Bus Futures: New Technologies for Cleaner Cities."" Specifically, INFORM reports that natural gas buses emit 40 to 86 percent less particulate matter and 38 to 58 percent less nitrogen oxides than diesel buses. Moreover, according to ""Bus Futures,"" natural gas is ""virtually toxic-free, while diesel exhaust contains more than 40 toxic constituents, about half of which are known or suspected carcinogens."" In addition to the clean air benefits, buses powered by domestically produced alternative fuels such as biodiesel, electricity, ethanol, natural gas, or propane can contribute significantly to our nation's energy security. ""School buses consume more than twice the amount of fuel used by the average passenger car,"" said Shelley Launey, Director of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Clean Cities Program. ""Collectively, when powered by alternative fuel, they can make a big difference in reducing our nation's petroleum consumption,"" she said. ""School buses are also highly visible to the community, which can generate good publicity for the school district or local government--they make an excellent alternative fuel niche market,"" she said.  M  Niche markets, according to the Clean Cities definition, are ""targets"" or opportunities for which alternative fuels Earlier this year, the Natural Resources Defense Council make sense. They include fleets with high mileage, high fuel-use vehicles that can reap the cost-savings benefits of (NRDC) and Coalition for Clean Air (CCA) published, using a less expensive alter""No Breathing in the Aisles,"" based on their native fuel.

The NRDC and CCA report that there are comprise only 25% of the population, they represent 40% approximately 2,675 alternative fuel school buses operated of the asthma cases--and asthma is the leading cause of by nearly 130 school districts across the country. The school absenteeism related to chronic conditions.  ost kids know not to stand behind their school bus. They know the bus could back up and accidentally hit them, and they know that the black smoke expelled from the tailpipe is not good to breathe. What they (and their parents) probably don't know is that the air inside the bus may pose an even greater health risk than what they're breathing outside.  4   majority is located in California, with large numbers also in Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Many of these fleets actively participate in the Clean Cities Program--for example, Clean Cities National Partner Award winners Northside Independent School District (Alamo Area coalition), Tulsa Public Schools (Greater Tulsa coalition), and Lower Merion School District (Greater Philadelphia coalition). The Clean Cities web site features a growing number of success stories about school bus fleets using alternative fuels such as biodiesel, natural gas, and propane. Whether they're required to (see side box) or they voluntarily pursue alternative fuels, school districts face a critical barrier--cost. Alternative fuels such as natural gas and propane may cost less than traditional transportation fuels, but the initial price of a new alternative fuel bus is approximately $30,000 more than a conventional vehicle.  districts finance the transition to a cleaner, alternative fuel fleet. For example, alternative fuel school buses feature prominently in the Comprehensive Energy Research and Technology Act of 2001, H.R. 2460, proposed by Congressman Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY).  Specifically, Subtitle A of H.R. 2460, referred to as the ""Alternative Fuel Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2001,"" would create a $300 million, DOE-sponsored, competitive grant program to fund up to 15 demonstration projects in partnership with state and local governments. Eligible projects would According to the National include the purchase of AFVs such as school buses, as well as infraHighway Traffic Safety structure to support vehicles purAdministration, each year, chased with the grant money.  440,00 public school buses travel 4.3 billion miles to transport 23.5 million children to and from school and school-related activities.  Some school districts, however, have been able to take advantage of state and local incentives to defray the initial cost. California, for example, offers several programs, including the Compressed Natural Gas School Bus Incentive Program, which can help reduce the initial purchase price of an alternative fuel bus even below the cost of a conventional diesel bus. Incentives in other states include Arizona's SB2001, New York's Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act Funding, and Pennsylvania's Alternative Fuels Incentive Grants (AFIG) Program, among others. Soon, schools without the benefit of local incentives may also be eligible for help. If passed, several bills pending on Capitol Hill could help local governments and school  Subtitle D, also called the ""Clean Green School Bus Act of 2001,"" would establish a DOE grant program for local governments and others that provide bus service to public school systems. Funds would be available for purchases of alternative fuel or ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses that would replace older, dirtier vehicles. Buses purchased would be required to meet certain emission standards, which would become stricter over time. Funds would also be available for alternative fuel infrastructure, with an emphasis on shared or public access stations.  Alternative fuel school buses are now the rule in L.A. basin California's South Coast Air Quality Management District now requires public agencies in the greater Los Angeles area to purchase clean fuel vehicles when expanding their fleets or replacing older vehicles. The rules, which in August survived a Federal court challenge by the Engine Manufacturers Association, apply to vehicles including buses and garbage trucks. In particular, the Clean On-Road School Buses rule (#1195), now in effect, requires all new school buses purchased or leased to operate on alternative fuel. Buses may also be retrofit with a California Air Resources Board (CARB)certified control device to reduce air toxic and criteria pollutant emissions. For more on information, please visit www.aqmd.gov/news1/Fleet_court_decision.htm.  DOE's Clean Cities Program also offers funds for school bus purchases through the State Energy Program (SEP). Nearly $490,000 was awarded for alternative fuel school bus projects this year. School buses will remain a project category in SEP 2002. The solicitation was expected in November 2001. Clean Cities' new school bus tool, distributed to all designated coordinators this summer, can also help school districts select the AFV buses that best meet their needs and determine the cost benefits of making the conversion.

Much of biodiesel's growth followed its addition to the short list of alternative fuels eligible for the kind of AFV acquisition credits first defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct). Effective in January 2001, the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule (CFR4901.11.1) allows covered fleets to earn such credits through the purchase of biodiesel fuel, for use in blends of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel (called B20) or higher. EPAct applies to federal, state, and alternative fuel provider fleets. Biodiesel use by state and fuel provider fleets multiplied more than sixfold between 1999 and 2000, according to their reports to DOE. In 1999, 12 such fleets used roughly 86,000 gallons. In 2000, 28 state and fuel provider fleets used 563,000 gallons of biodiesel fuel (see chart). The main reason for biodiesel's success is its logical fit in the nation's portfolio of transportation fuels. Biodiesel can be blended in any proportion with petroleum diesel. B20 is one common blend. Pure unblended biodiesel is called B100, or ""neat fuel."" Covered fleet operators can meet up to half of their AFV acquisition requirements using biodiesel. One AFV credit is earned through every 450 gallons of B100 (2,250 gallons of B20) purchased.

His fuel was vegetable oil--chemically similar to the soybean oil now commonly used as a feedstock for biodiesel fuel. A century later, biodiesel is becoming a mainstream alternative fuel. In the past decade alone, according to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB), it has gone from a nearly non-existent market position to use in more than 100 major fleets. Biodiesel is used in trucking, public transit, school districts, agriculture, public utilities, and military fleets.  Biodiesel passes the test for New Jersey schools New Jersey's Medford School District clearly illustrates the advantages of using biodiesel in school buses. In a four-year test beginning in 1997, the district has run half of its 44 buses on B20 biodiesel fuel and the other half on petroleum diesel. In basic performance, says district operations director Joe Biluck, no differences were detected between the two groups of buses. Fuel economy and start-up ability were identical even in colder weather. Biluck says the B20-fueled buses seemed to idle more smoothly, perhaps because of biodiesel's greater oxygen content.  Biodiesel Usage in State and Fuel Provider Fleets Number of Fleets 30 Gallons of Biodiesel (in thousands) 600  25  500  20  400  15  300  10  200  ""From a fleet manager's point of view the integration was completely seamless,"" he says. Importantly, the biodiesel fuel emitted noticeably cleaner exhaust. With students gathering around buses every day , the heavy black smoke from petroleum diesel is a constant health hazard. At least one bus normally transports handicapped students who aren't able to move in and out of buses quickly, says Biluck. The Medford district is not covered by EPAct. Its biodiesel test was funded by a Heavy Duty Vehicle grant from DOE to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, Division of Energy Department of Environmental Protection, which will largely dictate the future direction of biodiesel in the district. ""If I had my way, we'd start using it in all of our buses,"" says Biluck.  New Jersey's Medford School District noted no significant differences between petroleum diesel and biodiesel.  5  100  FY 1999  FY 2000  FY 1999  FY 2000  6   Soybeans ready for harvest.  Cincinnati bus passengers board the B20 Cincinnati this year put biodiesel into service in a big way, fueling 150 of its city transit buses with B20. The experimental program will continue through 2001. It follows several tests of alternative fuels by Cincinnati Metro dating as far back as 1993. ""Biodiesel cuts pollution without reducing engine power or mileage,"" claims Paul Jablonski, general manager of the agency. ""It gives us yet another way to improve our region's air quality."" The agency's use of B20 will increase fuel costs by about 10 percent per gallon. The fuel cost A U.S. Department of Transportation grant helps to defray Cincinnati's incremental fuel costs. difference is being funded by a $50,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Congestion Mitigation/Air Quality program, which encourages innovative clean air solutions. The fuel is supplied by World Energy, Inc. of Boston. Further benefits will go to Ohio farmers who grow the soybeans to make biodiesel. The state of Ohio is fifth in soybean production nationally. According to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, demand for soybased products will bring ""significant economic benefits to U.S. farmers.""  special systems. To prevent such problems, effective steps include:  Blending with No. 1 diesel, which is lighter and more volatile;  Using a cold-flow enhancing additive;  Using a heater to warm the fuel tank, filter, or lines;  Indoor storage and overnight parking. Lowering the sulfur content of conventional diesel fuel is a widely debated, high-profile program objective of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. By June 2006, new EPA regulations will reduce allowable sulfur content in petroleum diesel to 15 parts per million (ppm), from the current limit of 500 ppm. The sulfur reduction may cause new problems--lost lubricity and accelerated engine wear. But biodiesel is well positioned to be part of the solution. Augmenting conventional diesel fuel with just one or two percent biodiesel can effectively  Biodiesel blends may require minor changes to existing fueling infrastructure. They are commonly stored in standard tanks used otherwise for petroleum diesel. Engines running on B20 generally need no modifications. But blends with higher biodiesel content are more likely to require modifications, particularly to the fuel system. Using biodiesel in a conventional diesel engine can reduce unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. A 1998 life-cycle analysis by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy showed a 78 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from B100 compared to petroleum diesel. Acid rain-causing sulfur oxides and sulfates, components of conventional diesel, can also be reduced significantly. But emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) tend to show a slight increase. Among other drawbacks, pure biodiesel can cause rubber and other components to fail, so some engine modifications may be necessary to use pure biodiesel in existing engines. There is often a reduction in fuel econ-  omy and power for pure biodiesel, varying among different engines. And because it is not widely available, biodiesel is currently more expensive than petroleum diesel. Like standard No. 2 diesel, biodiesel thickens at low temperatures, so using it in cold climates requires  Concrete improvements in Arizona's environment Business owner Grant Goodman switched his entire fleet of trucks and heavy equipment from petroleum diesel to biodiesel in January 2001. Approximately 120 trucks, loaders, and aggregators now run on B100 at Rockland Materials, a concrete and gravel-mining company in Phoenix, Ariz. Motivated by a desire to improve local air quality, Goodman researched the emissions benefits of biodiesel. ""What grabbed my attention was the fact that we could reduce carcinogen and hydrocarbon emissions by such a significant amount."" Performance of the fleet was unaffected, he says. The change-over caused ""zero problems""--except a shrunken bottom line. With the price of biodiesel in Phoenix running at least 25 percent higher than regular diesel, the change reduced profits. ""We're running a $300,000 deficit to our competitors,"" he said in September. As a private business operator, Goodman is not regulated by EPAct, and was not forced to switch. The move was voluntary. ""I don't get a tax break,"" says Goodman, whose trucks travel the busiest streets in greater Phoenix. ""With kids riding around in diesel-powered school buses, I felt I had do to something.""  7   EPAct credit sales spur biodiesel use in Iowa restore its lubricity, according to tests by Stanadyne Automotive Corp., the nation's largest independent fuel injection manufacturer. Several biodiesel-based diesel supplements are made for that purpose. Biodiesel is made from soybean oil and other vegetable oils, and from animal fats. To produce biodiesel, the fat or oil is reacted with an alcohol, such as methanol, in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium. The catalyst typically is recovered for re-use. Fluctuating oil prices have pushed interest in biodiesel to levels greater than expected. Even private businesses unaffected by EPAct have switched from petroleum diesel (see Concrete Improvements, page 7), motivated by a desire to reduce foreign energy dependence. Recent legislation in Iowa established a fund to be used exclusively to purchase biodiesel fuel for vehicles operated by the Iowa Department of Transportation. The measure, known as Senate File 465 as it moved through the State Legislature, could significantly boost the demand for biodiesel in Iowa. According to EPAct, state fleets An abundant soybean crop helps make exceeding their vehicle purchase renewable energy possible in Iowa. requirements may sell the excess credits. States that do so must certify that the vehicles yielding such credits were truly operated on alternative fuels. Iowa will use the funds it generated in this manner to purchase biodiesel fuel, which will help support Iowa's soybean crop. Iowa's use of AFVs began in the early 1990s with state-level legislation mandating the use of ethanol-fueled vehicles. The state's transportation department purchased many Ford Taurus sedans and fueled them with E85. Iowa's law preceded EPAct's effective date, says department fleet manager David May, and pre-EPAct purchases commonly earned double or triple credits for the state. EPAct credits earned by Iowa have exceeded requirements many times over, May says. Selling the excess credits has already generated more than $74,000, and is expected to generate another $50,000 in the next year. Those funds will help finance the development of another clean, domestic home-grown fuel in Iowa, where more than 100,000 gallons of B20 will be purchased in the coming year.  Many major trucking fleets have made the switch to biodiesel; most use B20.  For more information...

Provides guidance on EPAct compliance and reporting; provides full text of the Biodiesel Fuel Use Credit Final Rule.  In its share of the overall market for domestic transportation diesel fuel, biodiesel is still small, accounting for less than one-tenth of one percent. But annual production has grown rapidly, from 5 million gallons in 2000 to an estimated 20 million gallons in 2001. Future growth could be substantial, but is difficult to quantify in part because biodiesel's success in the marketplace is so recent. Most biodiesel users are fleets, but growth in demand by individual users has spawned several publicly accessible fueling stations nationwide. Biodiesel now is produced in nine plants nationwide, with approximately 14 more in development or under construction, setting the stage for increased use in the future.  8   Coalitions Invited to Join  National AFV Day AP R I L 11, 2 0 02 Coordinators and all stakeholders in the Clean Cities Program are encouraged to participate in National AFV Day, a celebration of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) on April 11, 2002. The event was conceived by the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC), a group of technical schools, colleges, and universities devoted to training auto technicians in the service of AFVs. The group has 20 full members and approximately 60 associate and affiliate members including high school automotive programs, fuel providers, and Clean Cities coalitions. The NAFTC expects concurrent participation at the locations of many of its members and affiliates. ""We're trying for at least 100 sites,"" said NAFTC executive director Al Ebron. ""AFVs remain a wellkept secret, despite a growing number of manufacturers that produce them for the consumer market, and despite federal and state incentives for their use in government and business fleets."" The group offers a free information package with suggestions on how to stage and sponsor a local event. It includes guidelines for print communications such as press releases, and artwork for use in advertising. Also included is a draft letter of agreement, to use in signing up participants for local events. DOE's Clean Cities Program is one of several stakeholders working with the NAFTC to make the event happen. Others include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, General Motors, DaimlerChrysler, and Ford Motor Company. Organizers of local events are encouraged to seek the support of local entities to act as co-sponsors. National AFV Day is intended to promote AFV use in general and AFV service training in particular. Events should be should be designed to build and strengthen relationships, and aimed at target markets. Invitees could include legislators, health and environmental organization representatives, school board officials, fleet operators, auto dealers, car club members, and civic-minded individuals. At training locations, events can be a means to attract new students. Sponsoring a National AFV Day event shares much in common with the staging of Advancing the AFV Choice events by Clean Cities coalitions. The NAFTC encourages local sponsors to customize events according to local needs. To appeal to prospective students, for example, sponsors might include hands-on training or a scholarship giveaway. Other attractions can include:        An AFV ride-and-drive Technology demonstrations Contests and prizes A fair, gala, or open house Exhibits and panel discussions Educational presentations might cover:       AFV purchasing options, vehicles, and local dealerships Federal and state tax incentives Environmental benefits; impact on demand for foreign oil Local refueling and service options, locations  Events staged for National AFV Day, on April 11, 2002, may have much in common with past Advancing the AFV Choice events.  Trade shows and technology displays blend well with more festive events such as an outdoor barbecue. Media coverage can be cultivated successfully, as shown by Sheble McConnellogue (top right) of Colorado's Weld/ Larimer/Rocky Mountain National Park coalition.  Several Clean Cities coordinators have already expressed interest in participating in National AFV Day. One is Erin Russell, director of EVermont, which manages the Clean Cities Program in Vermont. ""We're excited about the opportunity to be part of such an important event,"" said Russell. ""Drawing attention to alternative fuel vehicles on a national scale is the key to broadening acceptance and use of these vehicles.""

Consumers have a new and improved tool to help them select their new vehicle. In a kickoff to Energy Awareness Month, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced the availability of new model year Fuel Economy Guide in a ceremony on October 9 at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). DOE produces the guide, published in print and on-line at www.fueleconomy.gov, in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition to fuel economy information, the web-based guide offers vehicle-specific emissions, greenhouse gas, and safety ratings data, creating a comprehensive, one-stop shop for new car-buyers. A dynamic web site, www. fueleconomy.gov features an annual fuel cost calculator and allows users to search for specific vehicles by class, make and model, miles per gallon--and of course, by fuel. Side-by-side comparisons of up to three vehicles at a time also enable users to select the cleanest, safest, most fuelefficient vehicle that meets their needs. at new car dealerships, public libraries, and credit unions nationwide. Initially launched in the fall of 1999, www. fuelecomomy.gov has experienced 1 million user sessions.  Buyer's Guide Adds AFV Ordering Info Vehicle ordering-window information for model year 2002 is now available on the Clean Cities Fleet Buyer 's Guide at www.fleets.doe.gov. The new feature, updated monthly, reports generally on production schedules for all AFV manufacturers. Production for low-volume vehicles such as AFVs is less consistent than that of traditional vehicles. In the past, vehicle buyers have waited as long as six months to have orders filled. The new feature indicates when orders are accepted, and gives a realistic idea of anticipated delivery dates. Available for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles, the information is accessible by clicking on ""How Can You Buy an AFV?"" The site also calculates the net incremental costs of buying AFVs, compared to conventional vehicles.  Alternative Fuel Price Report Clean Cities' Alternative Fuel Price Report provides a glimpse of fuel prices around the country. Obtained with the help of Clean Cities stakeholders, the prices are tabulated to illustrate trends and allow for price comparisons among alternative fuels, gasoline, and diesel fuel. The quarterly report is distributed to Clean Cities coordinators and posted on the Web at www.afdc.doe.gov/periodicals.html.  Find Used AFVs at AFVMarket.com Not everyone prefers a brand-new car, but used vehicles--particularly clean, alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs)-- are sometimes hard to find. Now, thanks to two long-time AFV champions, shopping for a used vehicle is a little easier. EV Rental Cars and EV World.com have joined forces to create AFVMarket.com, a new web site listing pre-owned AFVs and hybrid-electric vehicles available for sale at a discounted rate, compared to the original purchase price. The AFVMarket.com inventory consists of late-model vehicles, many of which were previously used as rental cars stationed at EV Rental locations in California, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. Available vehicles include the natural gas powered Ford Crown Victoria and Honda Civic GX, as well as the hybridelectric Honda Insight. The hybrid-electric Toyota Prius is expected soon. In addition to vehicle-specific searches by price, mileage, and location, the web site provides warranty information and offers links to the Clean Cities Fleet Buyer 's Guide for details about available incentives. For more information, please visit www.afvmarket.com.  DOE's Fuel Economy Guide for model year 2002 is now online. The print version will be available at car dealerships later this fall.  For energy- and cost-conscious consumers, the web site offers fuel-saving drivers' tips. A new gasoline price page can also direct users to stations offering the least expensive gas in town, and a new consumer information page answers a host of frequently asked questions about fuel pricing and can help drivers understand exactly where their money goes each time they visit the gas pump. The entire Model Year 2002 Fuel Economy Guide can be downloaded and printed from the web site. Officially printed guides will be available to the public later this fall  10   From the Automakers AFVs, Advanced Technology Vehicles Join the '02 Line-up Flex-fuel, bi-fuel, and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles return with few changes among automakers' offerings for the new model year. A complete listing of AFVs for 2002-- with powertrain, fuel capacity, and driving range information--can be found in the Alternative Fuels Data Center at www.afdc.doe.gov/pdfs/wModel_Year2002AFVs.pdf. From American Honda comes the Civic GX, a CNGfueled version of Honda's coupe. The GX boasts one of the world's cleanest combustion engines, says its manufacturer. Also from Honda is the hybrid Insight, powered both by batteries and gasoline. A hybrid-powered Civic will join the Honda line-up next spring. Hybrids do not qualify for EPAct fleet use credits, however.  The Ford Ranger pickup is available with E85 flex-fueling or electric power.  Mazda's B3000 pickup--essentially the same vehicle as Ford's Ranger, made in the same factory--is offered with E85 flex-fueling as well. Ethanol-powered pickups and SUVs from General Motors include the flex-fuel Tahoe, Suburban, and Sonoma. A small GM pickup and a passenger van offer CNG bi-fueling, with an onboard switch to select gasoline or natural gas. The electric-powered two-seat EV-1 coupe is available in California and Arizona only. Wieck Photo Database  Honda's natural gas-fueled Civic GX boasts of one of the world's cleanest combustion engines.  Of interest to electric utilities seeking EPAct compliance may be Toyota's RAV4-EV, an all-electric mini-SUV with an advertised driving range of 125 miles. Toyota also offers the Prius, a hybrid coupe that can go 570 miles on a tank of gasoline. To help California meet its own strict zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) requirements, Nissan offers the new Altra-EV, a mid-size wagon with lithium-ion battery power available to select fleets. Solectria's Citivan, sold nationwide, is the a service van with lead-acid battery power and a 40-mile range.  DaimlerChrysler now configures many of its vans and ever-popular minivans for natural gas and for E85 ethanol flex-fueling. In the Dodge Ram Van and Ram Wagon, a dedicated CNG-powered 5.2 liter V8 engine produces 200 horsepower. Among minivans, the Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Caravan can go more than 300 miles on a tank of E85. For light-duty truck fleets regulated by EPAct, Ford offers several variations of its half-ton pickup. The F-150 can be had with CNG-dedicated, CNG bi-fuel, and even LPG bi-fuel power. The smaller Ranger pickup is available with E85 flex-fueling; and with battery-electric power (and a range of 73 miles). Ford offers other flex-fuel vehicles including the Taurus sedan and various models of the Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford Motor Company's new TH!NK enterprise, founded to create environmentally friendly vehicles, plans limited U.S. distribution of its first neighborhood electric vehicle. The TH!NK neighbor will be sold in California and in many Sun Belt states in 2002. The four-seat neighborhood electric vehicle has a top speed of 25 mph.  Nissan's electric-powered Altra-EV is available only in California.  11  Nissan  Wieck Photo Database   Challenge Bibendum 2001 A rally by tire maker Michelin helps automakers put AFVs in the spotlight Tires play an important role in fuel efficiency, and the ambitious efficiency gains expected of cars in the future will demand superior tire technology. With that assertion, French tire manufacturer Michelin kicked off its third-ever Challenge Bibendum, a competitive event for ""environmentally innovative vehicles,"" from Oct. 26-29, 2001. The four-day event attracted both production vehicles and one-of-akind prototypes, powered by electricity, natural gas, propane, hydrogen, and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as diesel fuel and various hybrid-electric configurations. At least 10 vehicle makes were present, with participation by U.S., European, and Japanese automakers. Michelin  More than 30 vehicles completed the 227-mile trek across southern California and Nevada.  The Michelin Man's real name is ""Bibendum,"" a French reference to the ability of tires to ""drink up road hazards.""  In Los Angeles, the event opened with an elegant auto show in the Spanish courtyard of the historic Auto Club of Southern California. Attended by many international journalists, the day focused on styling and design. ""Beautiful cars can be environmentally friendly; let's not choose between fun and green,"" said Edouard Michelin, chairman of the host company and great grandson of its founder. The ZEbus, operated by SunLine Transit, demonstrated superior range due to roof-mounted hydrogen fuel supplies.  Next was a full day of track testing at the California Speedway. Vehicles competed in tests of acceleration, fuel efficiency, driving range, noise, braking, and slalom performance. Rather than vying against each other, however, production vehicles were measured against emission and performance standards set by their own manufacturers. No overall winners were declared. A hydrogen-powered adaptation of the 1965 Shelby Cobra CSX dominated acceleration tests. Day 3 marked the main event, a road rally, with a 32vehicle caravan crossing the desert from southern California to Las Vegas. Few zero-emission vehicles made the 227-mile trip. One notable exception was a relay team of four fuel cell-powered cars sponsored by the California Fuel Cell Partnership. Also making the trip was the 40passenger ZEbus, powered by Xcellsis and Ballard, and operated by the SunLine Transit Agency. SunLine, which is the driving force behind the Coachella Valley Clean Cities Coalition, provided mobile refueling of CNG and hydrogen-powered cars along the route. The event concluded with a recap for journalists arriving in Las Vegas for one of its biggest annual conventions, that of the Specialty Equipment Market Association. The SEMA show began with a conference on ""The Transportation Transformation,"" focusing on sustainable mobility for the 21st Century.

Alternative fuels and the Air Force have come together at Robins Air Force Base, 100 miles south of Atlanta. Robins AFB occupies nearly 9,000 acres and is home to 19,800 military and civilian personnel. It has long been a leader in military transportation, with responsibility for maintaining many tactical, cargo, and fighter aircraft. Its Support Equipment and Vehicle Management Directorate procures nearly 90 percent of ground vehicles for the Air Force worldwide, and 100 percent of support equipment such as bomb loaders and electric generators. reformer. Also in progress is a solid-oxide fuel cell that runs hotter and burns less fuel than a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The office has worked with industry partners in developing other AFV systems, including diesel-hybrid shuttle buses that now operate on the base. Roughly 500 vehicles at the base operate on some form of alternative fuel. The Electric-powered Multistop Cube Vans, used daily for cargo delivery at Robins, are total number of vehislated for upgrades such as a rapid-charge cles present, includsystem from EPRI/Southern Company. ing heavy trucks, is approximately 1,500. The resulting environmental impact was a factor in motivating the Robins Air Force Base to investigate the Clean Cities Program. Perazzola and other base personnel have been involved in forming a new coalition in central Georgia, working with the cities of Macon, Perry, and Warner Robins. The stakeholders hope to see their Clean Cities application completed and approved by spring of 2002. If they succeed, Robins will be one of approximately 20 military stakeholders in Clean Cities coalitions nationwide. Others include the U.S. Navy Public Works Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and more than a dozen Air Force bases around the country. Such organizations promise to fill an important niche market within Clean Cities. Both as an AFV buyer and a developer of technology, the military will help move the U.S. toward energy security, as part of its crucial role in national security in general.  Hybrid-electric tow tractors at Robins mate a Cummins diesel engine with 48 lead-acid batteries and a 100-kilowatt Seimens motor.  Robins also houses the Alternative Fuel Vehicle System Program Office (AFVSPO) for the Air Force. For years, the base has been using and experimenting with AFVs, hybrids, and various advanced-technology vehicles. The Robins base and the military are interested in alternative fuels for several reasons, says Carl Perazzola, civilian director of the AFVSPO. One is strategic, related to an Air Force initiative called Single Battle Fuel Forward. The assumption is that jet fuel (known in the military as JP8) will always be present--and necessary--in combat. But a diverse range of other fuels will help ensure a constant supply of feedstocks. That heightens the military's interest in hydrogen fuel cells, says Lieutenant James Muldoon, an engineer working in the AFVSPO. Hydrogen can be produced by reforming many fuels including diesel, gasoline, ethanol, and CNG. It can also be derived from water through electrolysis. The AFVSPO is developing fuel cell technology in many applications and variations, including a JP8-to-hydrogen fuel  ISE Research, Inc.  Hawaii's Hickham Air Force Base participated in a statewide electric vehicle demo program in July, with 15 Hyundai Santa Fe all-electric SUVs.  13   Clean Cities Roundup Top Ten Clean Cities Coalitions for 2000  Northeast Ohio San Joaquin Valley Los Angeles San Diego Region Dallas/Ft.

Similar to previous years, however, survey responses will be used to select winners of the annual coalition awards presented at the National Clean Cities Conference, as well as determine the annual top ten ranking--so coordinators are urged to be as accurate as possible and submit their reports on time. For more information about the annual Clean Cities Coordinator survey, please contact TG Powell at 202-586-8077 or tg.powell@ ee.doe.gov.  FuelMaker and Honda Offer Clean Cities Incentive Clean Cities Announces Top Ten Coalitions The National Clean Cities Program recently announced the ""top ten"" best performing coalitions in 2000, identified in the map above. The annual top ten list is determined using data collected from the annual Clean Cities Coordinator surveys which document coalition activities in the previous year. Specific criteria include the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), alternative fuel refueling stations added during the year, and the total number of AFVs and stations in a coalition's service area. The ranking criteria, based on a point system, are weighted according to the level of investment required and the expected amount of actual alternative fuel used. Refueling station construction, for example, receives significantly more points than individual vehicle acquisition because of the investment involved; heavy-duty AFV acquisitions receive more points than light-duty vehicle acquisitions, and dedicated vehicles earn more points than flex-fuel vehicles because they typically displace more petroleum. Coalition activities such as membership meetings, media coverage, and outreach events are also considered when developing the ranking, although no point value is assigned. In another important note to coalition coordinators, the National Clean Cities Program also has announced a change in the timing of the annual survey. In response to coordinator concerns, survey has moved from spring to fall. Coordinators should have already received their 2001 surveys, which are due this December and intended to document year 2001 activities. To ease the transition, the new survey includes fewer questions than those from previous years and will cover only the basics, such as AFV acquisitions, FuelMaker Corporation and American Honda have partnered to offer Clean Cities coordinators and stakeholders an increased discount on purchases of FuelMaker natural gas refueling units and Honda's dedicated natural gas-powered Civic GX. The deal, available for vehicles purchased and delivered before March 31, 2002, increases previously available incentives and is open to private businesses and government fleets (natural gas utility fleets and individuals are ineligible). FuelMaker will increase its individual refueling unit incentive to $700 for each small unit and $2,200 for each large unit. Honda will increase its incentive, offered for each group of four Civic GXs purchased, to $1,200. For more information on the Honda-FuelMaker Clean Cities incentive, please visit www.fuelmaker.com/ccpromo or call Paula Herbert of FuelMaker at 800-898-3835.  Funding Available for Clean Cities Projects Attention Clean Cities Coordinators! The 2002 State Energy Program (SEP) Alternative Fuels Special Projects grant solicitation will be available in December and can be downloaded from the Clean Cities Web site at www. ccities.doe.gov/support.shtml. More than $4 million will be available to fund projects in the following categories: niche markets, infrastructure, school bus technologies, alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) signage, and Clean Cities coordinator positions. Important changes include more funding available for infrastructure projects and a new AFV signage category. Only designated Clean Cities coalitions are eligible for funding. For more information, please call your DOE Regional Office Clean Cities manager.  14   Toyota Supplies Electric SUVs to 10 Clean Cities Coordinators Denver Clean Cities Coordinator Mike Gutirrez stands beside a Toyota RAV4-EV. The vehicle is one of 10 electric-powered 1998-model vehicles loaned to coordinators by Toyota Motor Company, as a gesture of support for Clean Cities coalitions. Toyota provided the vehicles for one year of use, along with one electric charging station to accompany each vehicle. An employee of public utility Xcel Energy, Gutirrez recently signed on as full-time coordinator of the Denver coalition following eight years of service by Deborah Kielian of the City and County of Denver.  From the States AFVs: The Latest Campus Craze With relatively short vehicle routes and central fueling capabilities, university campuses can be an ideal niche for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The University of Kentucky, for example, recently renovated its entire fueling facility and installed an E85 tank so its 75 flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) can use alternative fuel. Drivers at Murray State University (MSU) in western Kentucky are also fueling their 35 FFVs with E85 from a new on-site pump. But E85 isn't the only alternative fuel of choice at MSU. In response to professors' concerns, the school is considering alternatives to its gasoline and diesel-powered support equipment, including quiet, electric-powered mowers. Some faculty and staff members will also have an opportunity to drive Ford Th!nk EVs in a station car program coming soon to the university. In addition to its EVs, Emory has a fleet of ten compressed natural gas (CNG) shuttles. Drivers refuel using a FuelNet card--the key to Atlanta's universal refueling program--to obtain CNG from a nearby station owned by the city of Atlanta. The school plans to build an on-site CNG station that will also be accessible to other fleets participating in the FuelNet program.  But perhaps the most popular in Emory's AFV program is what the students call the ""Garage Mahal,"" a new parking deck built specifically to accommodate up to 50 electric rechargers.

They drive AFVs. President Bush, when visiting his ranch in Crawford, Texas, now drives a propane-powered Ford F-250 pickup truck. What's more, the vehicle prominently displays a Clean Cities window decal. On November 7, Clean Cities Director Shelley Launey joined other propane vehicle proponents in an informal ceremony to recognize the installation of a propane refueling station on the President's ranch. Also, although the truck has been in use on the ranch since August 5, a ceremonial key to the President's new AFV was presented to Bush Ranch foreman, Kenneth Englebrecht, to mark the addition of a cleanfueled vehicle to the President's ranch fleet. Its Texas location makes propane an excellent energy choice for the Bush Ranch. According to the Propane Energy and Research Council (PERC), Texas ranks first  in the nation in industrial propane production, the total number of vehicles and vehicle fleets that run on propane, and the total number of propane fueling stations. In addition to Launey, ceremony speakers included Michael Williams, Texas Railroad Commission Chairman; Bruce Toellner, vice president of Mitchell Energy and Development and chairman of the Propane Education and Research Council; and Curtis Donaldson, president of Clean Fueling Technologies, a propane equipment and service provider.  16  AP Photo/Kenneth Lambert"

Among the vehicles in Ford Motor Company's model year 2001(MY 2001) lineup is an AFV that's sure to be a hit in many Clean Cities. The new dedicated compressed natural gas (CNG) E-450 cutaway Econoline van, manufactured without a back panel to allow for the addition of a custom coach, is a perfect fit for many alternative fuel niche markets. Popular cutaway applications include hotel and airport shuttles, delivery vans, and school buses—each a high priority niche activity area identified by Clean Cities coalitions. ""This cutaway, or cab and chassis version, of Ford's Econoline van series has been at the top of the request list for fleets interested in alternative fuels for several years,"" said Dennis Smith, Clean Cities Niche Market Specialist. According to Smith, Ford's new offering will benefit fleets in more ways than one. ""Traditionally, these fleets are powered by diesel fuel. In comparison, this new dedicated CNG version will provide significant noise and emissions reductions, while reducing oil consumption,"" he said.   Powered by a 5.4-liter engine, the E-450 CNG cutaway comes with a four speed automatic transmission, a 176-inch wheelbase, and dual rear wheels. Three underbody tanks provide an estimated driving range of 125 to 150 miles, but customers can purchase two additional tanks to be installed through Ford's Qualified Vehicle Modifier program and extend the range to 250 miles. The new cutaway will be built at a Ford assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio and is targeted for ultra low emission vehicle certification. For more information on Ford's new MY 2001 dedicated CNG cutaway Econoline van, call Ford's alternative fuels hotline at 877-ALT-FUEL or check out  www.fleet.ford.com/products_services/alternative_vehicles/default.asp .    Toyota Prius Hits the U.S. Market    It was perfect timing. After initial success in Japan, Toyota announced the U.S. launch of its hybrid gasoline/ electric Prius this summer, amidst a growing public interest in energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. The Prius uses both a 1.5-liter gasoline-powered internal combustion engine and a nickel metal hydride battery pack powering an electric motor to achieve 52 miles per gallon in city driving (614 miles/tank) and 45 miles per gallon on the highway (531 miles/tank). The four-door/five passenger vehicle comes with an eight-year/100,000 mile battery and hybrid system warranty and a free seven-day/24 hour roadside assistance program. A certified super ultra low emission vehicle, the Prius has received several environmental awards, including the Sierra Club's Excellence in Environmental Engineering Award and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's First Annual Global Climate Protection Award.  Early adopters eager to experience the Prius, could pre-order the vehicle on Toyota's Web site starting in June, with vehicle deliveries beginning in late August. The Prius is already sold out until January and the waiting list continues to grow. For more information, check out  www.toyota.com .    DOE Launches Its First Technology Snapshot    To help consumers understand ""just what is a hybrid anyway?"" DOE published the first in a series of ""Technology Snapshots"" to help answer questions, alleviate concerns, and spark interest in early adopters of hybrid vehicles. The debut brochure, sponsored in part by Toyota and featuring Prius, describes the new technology and how it works—in plain English. It also provides an overview of the vehicle's performance, emissions, and fuel economy as compared to its conventional gasoline powered counterparts. The Technology Snapshots will be available electronically on the Clean Cities Web site at  www.ccities.doe.gov . Printed copies will be available in limited numbers at Toyota dealerships that offer the Prius.    Honda Civic GX Receives Top Green Car Rating    In an update to its model year 2000 Green Book: The Environmental Guide to Cars & Trucks, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) awarded Honda's Civic GX, a dedicated compressed natural gas (CNG) powered vehicle, its highest green car rating. The GX, recently certified to California's super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) standard, now shares the top spot with General Motors' electric EV1. ""The fact that two vehicles tie for the crown is significant since electric vehicles have previously dominated our greenest vehicle list,"" said John DeCicco, ACEEE Senior Associate and lead author of the Green Book.  ACEEE's Green Scores, which are based on emissions and fuel economy testing, account for tailpipe pollution and global warming impacts, including emissions from auto factories, petroleum refineries, and power plants in the case of electric vehicles.

For many in the transportation industry, it's also the auto show season. In Tokyo and Detroit, automakers impressed audiences, who were anxious to catch a glimpse of the vehicles for the new millennium. Hybrid electric and fuel cell concept vehicles drew much of the attention, as environmentally friendly transportation is a growing concern among consumers. Ford and General Motors (GM) unveiled their hybrid vehicles developed with the help of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). The new energy efficient hybrids, still under development, boast fuel economies of 80, 90, and even 100 miles per gallon (mpg). Below are a few of the vehicles showcased last fall in Tokyo and at the North American International Auto Show held in January 2000. Although most are still concepts and do not compete directly with today's alternative fuel vehicles, these hybrid-electric and fuel cell technologies forecast an exciting future for drivers everywhere.    Ford Prodigy     On the outside, the Ford Prodigy looks very similar to the conventional model year 2000 vehicles. What's on the inside, however, is a much different story. The Prodigy, a hybrid-electric concept vehicle designed to be a family sedan, uses a propulsion system with drive units on both axles. An experimental four-cylinder, 1.2 liter diesel engine, and an electric drive motor enable fuel economy of 80 mpg with diesel fuel (the equivalent of 70 mpg in a gasoline vehicle). Made almost entirely of aluminum, the Prodigy is extremely light and aerodynamic; rear-facing cameras replace traditional side view mirrors to reduce drag. But even though Ford uses the latest technology, it has not lost its focus on practicality. Unlike many other hybrid-electric concepts, the Prodigy has a usable trunk.    Honda Insight and FCX    Honda's hybrid-electric Insight needed no introduction, as it was among the first hybrid vehicles to be officially unveiled last year (and it was also showcased at the Fifth National Clean Cities Conference in June 1999). In addition to highlighting the Insight, Honda unveiled its latest advanced technology concept vehicle, the FCX, at the  auto show in Detroit. The FCX is a fuel cell prototype sedan that Honda plans to have on the road by 2003. The prototype models include both hydrogen- and methanol-based systems.    GM's Precept and Chevrolet Triax    General Motors (GM) is also working on two new hybrid concepts-the GM Precept and the Chevrolet Triax. The Precept is among the world's most energy efficient vehicles; it can attain 90 miles per diesel gallon (80 mpg gasoline) equivalent. GM unveiled the sleek, aerodynamic hybrid-electric concept vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Precept features a dual-axle regenerative hybrid propulsion system that combines electric and either gasoline or diesel engine systems. The fuel cell version of the Precept also made its debut in Detroit. It uses a hydrogen hydride storage system, which GM boasts will attain 108-mpg equivalent and up to 500 miles in range.    The Chevrolet Triax, featured at the Tokyo and North American International Auto Shows, is a sharply angled and highly versatile hybrid vehicle that can be produced with one of three powertrains-4WD electric, 2WD gasoline, or 4WD gasoline-electric hybrid. Customers will be able to select the type of powertrain that best meets their needs. In its hybrid form, the Triax has an electric motor that powers the front wheels and captures regenerative braking energy to recharge the battery. A gasoline engine drives the rear wheels, and a second electric motor captures the regenerative braking energy from the rear wheels and starts the engine.    Toyota's HV-M4    Although Toyota showcased its highly popular hybrid, the Prius, in Detroit, the company unveiled its newest hybrid concept vehicle-the HV-M4- at the Tokyo Auto Show last fall. The HV-M4, the world's first hybrid-electric 4WD minivan, is powered by a 2.4 liter gasoline engine and two electric motors, one for the front wheels and one for the back wheels. The HV-M4 is reported to meet Japan's soon-to-be toughest emissions standards, J-ULEV. With room for six and its own mobile power station (internal and external electric sockets that can power a microwave or television without extra charging), the HV-M4 will be an exciting entry into the hybrid world.   Look for coverage of DaimlerChrysler's new hybrid, the Dodge ESX3, in upcoming issues of AFN.

Both auto shows focused on environmentally friendly vehicles with advanced automotive technologies. The automakers demonstrated commitment to more energy-efficient and less polluting transportation.      Both General Motors' (GM) and Honda's EV exhibits were well attended. The GM EV1, available only through leasing, was a key attraction at GM's Saturn exhibit as EV1 owners shared their driving experiences. Honda's exhibit also drew crowds as attendees asked questions about the EV Plus, which is currently available in California through a pilot lease program.     The Prius, Toyota's new HEV, was accompanied by an elaborate show highlighting the propulsion system. The display, with the help of video, component cutaways, and moving parts, showed how the hybrid system actually works. Currently, the Prius is being sold only in Japan, but it may be available in the United States through a 1999 pilot program.     DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies (OTT) exhibit, which featured a student-built HEV, also attracted much interest. The vehicle, built by the University of California-Davis, won first place in OTT's 1997 Future Car Challenge, a student engineering competition in which college students competed to build an 80-mpg fuel-  efficient vehicle that performs like a traditional vehicle. Engineering students, representatives from OTT's Office of Technology Utilization, and California Clean Cities' stakeholders answered questions about HEVs and explained the program's involvement in developing fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). Consumers were especially excited about hybrids; many said they would buy them when they become available to the public.      At the Detroit Auto Show, the automakers reinforced their commitment to advanced automotive technologies. GM showcased its advanced vehicles and EVs in a high-tech video display featuring parallel and series hybrids, and methanol-powered fuel cell concept vehicle technologies. GM's EV1 was outfitted with an Ovonic nickel metal hydride battery, which could increase the EV1's range to 120-160 miles per charge. ""Our family of clean car options is growing fast,"" said Jack Smith, GM's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""This year, we're phasing in nickel metal hydride batteries to our pioneering vehicles, the EV1 and S10 electric truck, and we plan to have a production-ready HEV by 2001.""     Ford unveiled its P2000 DIATA, a mid-sized HEV weighing 40% less than a standard mid-size sedan with a fuel economy of 63 mpg. The P2000 has an aluminum direct-injected compression ignition engine and lightweight body parts. Ford also displayed a fuel cell-powered P2000. ""Later this year we'll have an electric hybrid powered version of the P2000 on the road. And by 2000, we will have a fuel cell version that produces no emissions other than water vapor,"" said Jack Nasser, Ford Automotive Operations president.      Chrysler displayed its Dodge Intrepid ESX2 sedan, which uses lightweight composite plastics and a diesel-electric hybrid engine to meet future vehicle emission requirements and achieve up to 70 mpg.      Domestic automakers are currently working together to develop hybrids through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), a government/industry partnership between the Big Three automakers (Chrysler, Ford, and GM) and DOE. The partnership's goal is to develop and bring to market a prototype 80-mpg vehicle by model year 2004. As shown by the demonstration of vehicles at the early 1998 auto shows, the new concept vehicles have significant technological advancements. However, these vehicles will be required to achieve the more ambitious PNGV goal of a safe, reliable, cost-competitive 80-mpg vehicle with very low emissions and a 100,000-mile vehicle life.      Ford Moves into the Fast Lane    Ford Offers E85 Muscle Car    You better not blink when you see Ford's future E85 offering, or you might miss it! Ford unveiled its Mustang Super Stallion concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January. The vehicle comes equipped with a 545-horsepower 5.4-liter engine with the E85 flexible-fuel option. The Super Stallion can do the quarter mile in a mere 13 seconds; whoever thought AFVs could be so much fun! The Stallion will be offered in limited quantities in model year 1999. For more details, call your local Ford dealer or the National Alternative Fuels Hotline at 800-423-1DOE.      Does America Want Ford's E85 Windstar?    Ford is currently testing prototype E85 Windstars in several test fleets throughout the Midwest. So far the vehicles are performing well, according to Rob Seiter of Ford Motor Company. ""Some of the vehicles have logged more than 15,000 miles and are performing flawlessly."" Most of the fuel system and engine emission control technology comes from the E85 Taurus, which has a history of reliable performance. One of the goals of the demonstration project is to evaluate consumer response to the product. Commercialization of the E85 Windstar will depend on an evaluation of market potential for the vehicle.      Ford FFV Taurus Sales Look Good for 1998    According to Ford representatives, favorable sales figures are expected for the flexible-fuel Taurus for 1998. The Taurus is one of the favorites of federal fleet managers who will be using these vehicles to meet EPAct purchasing requirements. The Taurus FFV has no increased incremental cost, which makes it an attractive option for fleet managers concerned about the bottom line. The flexible-fuel concept (a fuel system that can run on 85% alcohol, gasoline, or a combination of both) gives drivers fuel flexibility without additional costs.      Ford Announces AFV Incentives for 1998    Ford has announced incentives for 1998 model year AFVs reaching $2,000 per vehicle. The car prices, different for each model, are based on the reengineering cost of each vehicle built to run on a specific fuel. The incentives include $1,000 for the flexible-fuel Taurus, and either $1,500 or $2,000 for the other AFVs. Also, the Ford EV Ranger has a $5,000 incentive off the actual price!

GX252-77-11677572	"State of California California Environmental Protection Agency AIR RESOURCES BOARD  Executive Summary to the STAFF REPORT  2000 ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAM BIENNIAL REVIEW  August 7, 2000   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 1990, California embarked on an ambitious strategy to reduce vehicle emissions to zero. This objective was to be achieved through the gradual introduction of electric vehicles into the California fleet. Specifically, the Air Resources Board mandated that at least 2 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent of new car sales be zero-emitting by 1998, 2001 and 2003, respectively. The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate for passenger cars has been adjusted twice since then, in 1996 and 1998. The underlying goal, however, has not changed. California remains committed to achieving zero emissions performance wherever feasible in the vehicle fleet. The challenge is determining how to achieve sustainable success in the field. As evidence of the State's commitment, California has partially subsidized the introduction of battery electric vehicles through grants and fleet purchases. That support is expected to continue. The rationale for California's commitment is simple. Zero-emission technology is necessary to achieve the State's public health protection goals. Health-based state and federal air quality standards continue to be exceeded in regions throughout California, and more areas of the State are likely to be designated as nonattainment with promulgation of the new federal eight-hour ozone standard. California's burgeoning population and robust economy mean continued upward pressure on statewide emissions. Manufacturing, power generation, petroleum refining, goods transport, home heating and cooling, personal mobility and a wide range of human activities all have direct air pollution consequences. Accomplishing zero emissions in any of these source categories (or portion thereof) mitigates their adverse impacts and protects human health. Zero-emission technologies also transcend some of the persistent problems with conventional air pollution sources. Combustion-based engines are inherently higher emitting and prone to deterioration over time. Catastrophic failures are also a concern. Older gasoline-powered vehicles, for example, become gross emitters if their emission control systems fail. Combustible fuels also have significant ""upstream"" impacts. Refining, fuel storage and delivery all have associated emissions from both routine operations, accidents (breakdowns, fuel spills), and ongoing compliance problems (e.g., leaking underground tanks). Apart from upset conditions that may occur during electric power generation, zero emission vehicles have none of these vulnerabilities. A battery powered electric car will remain emission-free throughout its useful life.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 Current ZEV Mandate ARB regulations require that 10 percent of the new light-duty vehicles offered for sale in California for model year 2003 be zero emitting. This requirement applies to intermediate and large volume vehicle manufacturers only. Manufacturers have significant flexibility in meeting the ZEV requirements. Auto companies can earn extra ZEV credits by introducing vehicles before 2003, thereby reducing their total obligation. Extra credit is also available for battery electric vehicles with more than a 100 mile range per charge. Manufacturers may also delay compliance by one year provided they produce two years' worth of ZEVs by the end of 2004. Finally, large manufacturers can satisfy up to 6 percent of the 10 percent ZEV requirement with near-zero emitting technologies, and intermediate manufacturers may meet the entire 10 percent obligation via that route (producing no electric vehicles at all). Eleven auto manufacturers are expected to qualify as ""intermediate"" in 2003: BMW, Hyundai, Isuzu, Jaguar, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Rover, Subaru (Fuji), Volkswagen and Volvo. Six auto companies are expected to qualify as ""large"" in 2003: DaimlerChrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. If no change is made to today's ZEV regulation, staff estimates that approximately 22,000 electric vehicles would need to be offered for sale in 2003 to meet a four percent ZEV requirement. However, this total could change significantly, up or down, based on each manufacturer's actual production decisions and their chosen compliance path. As noted above, early ZEV introduction or the use of additional vehicles with extended range would decrease the 2003 obligation. Reduced reliance on PZEVs, on the other hand, would increase the number of ZEVs needed. The ZEV mandate continues in 2004 and each year thereafter. Again, if the rule is unchanged, staff estimates ZEV availability will grow gradually over time, reaching 31,000 to 78,000 units (4 percent to 10 percent) by 2006. The September 2000 Biennial Review When the ZEV mandate was adopted in 1990, electric vehicles were in a very early stage of development. To ensure successful implementation, the Board directed staff to report biennially on the status of technological progress. The September 2000 biennial review is the fifth in-depth examination of the technical and economic issues related to ZEVs. Since auto makers generally need three years' lead time for production, this biennial review is also the last significant opportunity to assess their readiness for meeting the 2003 requirements. This report describes the current status of ZEV technology and the prospects for nearand long-term improvement. The analysis is based upon experience gained through the 1996 Memorandum of Agreement (see below), staff meetings with each of the affected   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 manufacturers, contract work performed by outside experts, and extensive comments received at two public workshops conducted earlier this year. 1996 Memorandum of Agreement The original ZEV mandate called for 2 percent penetration in 1998 (approximately 20,000 vehicles). However, in 1996, the ARB determined that a smaller introduction was warranted given the status of electric vehicle technology at the time. Accordingly, the ARB's Executive Officer entered into Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with large volume manufacturers to produce a limited number of ZEVs, specifically 3,750 vehicles between calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Multiple credits for advanced batteries reduced the total legal commitment to just over 1,800 electric vehicles. Today there are approximately 2,300 electric vehicles on the road in California. The products are highly attractive, high performing and range in style from vans, pick-up trucks, sport utility vehicles and station wagons to two-seater sports cars. All of these electric vehicles were introduced within the last four years. The only significant gap is the absence of a 4-door, 5-passenger ZEV sedan, which no manufacturer is currently producing. Although the market is just forming, customer interest is encouraging and suggests that additional demand exists for ZEV products. Unfortunately, the full extent of this demand cannot be quantified because very few electric vehicles are available. Those manufacturers who have met their quotas have largely ceased production. Companies still making ZEVs have encountered production delays and are mostly marketing to fleets. This virtual ""black out"" condition was not anticipated when the MOAs were signed in 1996. It also complicates staff's analysis of market readiness for 22,000 ZEVs in 2003. When even the most motivated customers cannot obtain electric vehicles, the ability to gauge broader consumer interest and acceptance are severely diminished. The primary reason for the ""black out"" is cost. Manufacturers are not yet able to produce a competitively priced electric vehicle without incurring significant losses on each unit leased or sold. The secondary reason is uncertainty. Car companies are unwilling to invest in volume production until they see the business case for each ZEV model, a certain market, and a definitive regulatory signal from the State. Implementation of Year 2003 Requirements 1. Vehicle Technology Assessment  There is no technological barrier to building battery powered ZEVs; the issue is cost and consumer acceptance. With regard to near-zero emission vehicles, technology exists which allows vehicles to achieve the required level of performance. Several manufacturers have stated, however, that due to lead time considerations they will not be able to build enough PZEVs to take full advantage of the partial ZEV option in 2003. If they cannot overcome those challenges, more battery electric vehicles will be needed   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 to meet the 10 percent ZEV mandate. Hybrid vehicles are an environmentally attractive product and could achieve near-zero (PZEV) emissions performance in the near future. Finally, hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles have potential to become an additional pure ZEV technology, but will not be commercially available by 2003. These conclusions are explained in more detail below. Battery electric vehicles are clearly technologically feasible. Seven models are on the road including GM's EV1 2-seat sports car; the Chevrolet S-10 and Ford Ranger pick-up trucks; Honda's EV PLUS (a 4-seat, 2-door platform comparable to Honda's CRV), the Toyota RAV4 sport utility vehicle; Nissan's Altra EV station wagon; and the DaimlerChrysler EPIC minivan. In addition, several classes of smaller battery electric vehicles are emerging. These include low-speed vehicles (LSVs, also referred to as ""neighborhood electric vehicles"" or NEVs) and low-range vehicles designed for in-city driving (City EVs). Examples of the latter include the Ford TH!NK, the Toyota E-COM, and Nissan's Hyper-Mini. All of these vehicles qualify as ZEVs under the current ARB regulation. Regarding PZEVs, the leading candidates are extremely clean gasoline-powered cars, with or without hybrid electric drive-train technology. To qualify for PZEV credit, a vehicle must be certified to the super ultra low emission level (SULEV) exhaust standards, have zero evaporative emissions, and come with a 150,000 mile warranty. To date, only the Nissan Sentra has achieved PZEV status. Three other vehicles (Honda Accord, Honda Civic GX, and Toyota Prius) have attained the SULEV criteria, but have not met the remaining requirements. Both large and intermediate volume manufacturers are concerned about their ability to overcome all the engineering challenges implicit in the PZEV criteria by 2003. If they cannot reach that objective, up to the full 10 percent of battery electric cars may be required. Staff concurs that the PZEV criteria are extremely challenging and that some manufacturers will be unable to take full advantage of the PZEV option in 2003. Hybrid electric vehicles are the newest entrants to the advanced vehicle field. These vehicles combine batteries, a supplemental electric drive train, and a downsized conventional fuel tank to increase overall efficiency. Hybrid vehicles consume less fuel per mile of operation, thereby reducing upstream environmental impacts and releases of climate changing gases. Hybrid vehicles may also be low, ultra low or super ultra low emitting if they are designed to meet those respective exhaust standards. Two hybrid vehicles are currently available: the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius. Although neither qualifies for PZEV credit at this time, there is no inherent technological reason why hybrids cannot achieve PZEV performance. The main obstacle is the time needed to design, test and perfect the necessary emission controls. Fuel cell vehicle (FCV) by pure hydrogen from examining the potential types. A few prototype technology has the potential to be zero emitting when powered a relatively clean source. The California Fuel Cell Partnership is for commercializing such technology, along with other FCV fuel vehicles are available for testing and demonstration.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 2. Battery Technology Assessment  Batteries are the single most expensive component of electric vehicles. For that reason, affordable battery packs--both today and when produced in volume--are crucial to achieving a sustainable electric vehicle market. ARB's existing regulations also place a premium on advanced (long-range) battery technology. This preference was based on early survey results and upon staff's judgment that electric vehicles with greater than 100 mile range will sell better, to more people and for more uses, than shorter range vehicles. ARB contracted with a team of outside experts to obtain the best available information on battery advances, costs and future trends. The Battery Panel concluded that nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries were the most promising advanced technology, having both high performance and the longest useful life. Unfortunately, the Panel also concluded that battery costs are high and will not meet cost-competitive targets for some time. Although volume production will help, a breakthrough is needed to achieve truly affordable NiMH packs. Several commenters have suggested that ARB revisit its preference for advanced battery technology. Lead acid (PbA) batteries, they suggest, could meet market needs at a far lower cost. Their justification is two-fold. First, several EV drivers testified at staff workshops that that their actual driving needs were lower than they anticipated before they leased a ZEV and that they would not pay a premium for greater range. In addition, some auto manufacturers are closely examining the business case for leadacid based City Cars that would be overtly marketed as limited range, niche vehicles. The opposing view is that advanced batteries meet a broader range of driving needs, produce less waste (since they last longer), and may ultimately serve a larger consumer market. 3. Infrastructure Assessment  Unlike conventional vehicles, battery powered ZEVs do not require an extensive ""fueling"" infrastructure since most customers will recharge at work or at home. The availability of public charging stations is nonetheless extremely important because of its influence on consumer confidence and acceptance. Public chargers also enable ZEV owners to drive longer distances, and to reach more destinations than they otherwise might. The public infrastructure for electric vehicles continues to expand in California. Currently, there are about 400 public charging stations statewide with approximately 700 separate chargers. Most of these were constructed with a combination of government and electric utility funds. Recently, a few private companies have begun to offer electric charging services to their customers. The most notable example is Costco, which has a corporate-wide ""all electric"" philosophy. Staff expects these services to expand as additional local governments and private companies embrace electric vehicle technologies.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000  The most difficult issue affecting public charging infrastructure is the absence of uniform charging standards or equipment. A little more than half of the chargers are inductive; the rest are conductive. Current vehicles use a 220 volt system. When City Cars come to market, they will introduce the need for a new minimum voltage of 110. There is no easy way around this dilemma. Because the chargers are integrally linked to vehicle design and have competitive characteristics, manufacturers are unwilling and may actually be unable to move toward full standardization. Fast charging has been successfully demonstrated in the DaimlerChrysler EPIC minivan and holds great promise for the future. However, there is a significant economic barrier: fast charging is more expensive per station and would require extensive financial support to implement. Fast chargers also require special battery packs that can receive rapid charging without producing excessive heat. 4. Market Assessment  There is significant disagreement over the extent of market demand for electric vehicles. Manufacturers assert that the lack of leases during the first years when vehicles were available means that the market can only absorb a few hundred ZEVs per year. Electric vehicle advocates and fleet operators point to current waiting lists as evidence of strong customer interest and pent-up demand. Staff views this as the most difficult area in which to develop reliable estimates. The entire market is new and product availability has been constrained such that true consumer interest is exceedingly difficult to gauge. The recent emergence of fundamentally new ZEVsnamely city cars and neighborhood EVsfurther complicates staff's assessment. Although the business case for inexpensive, in-town EVs appears to be promising, there is as yet no market experience for selling these products in the U.S. Manufacturers will have to start from scratch in building consumer awareness and interest. Left unchanged, the current ZEV requirement will result in approximately 22,000 electric vehicles by 2003. That represents almost a ten-fold increase over the number of ZEVs on the road in California today. The quantity of ZEVs will grow in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as ZEV production ramps up per the current ARB regulation. Whether all of these vehicles can be successfully marketed and placed is a key issue facing the Board. Studies and surveys indicate that the primary factors affecting EV market demand are range, recharge time and competitive pricing. Based on experience to date and public testimony, staff has identified several other factors that are critical to ongoing success. The single greatest need is for near term ZEV availability, followed by a smooth, orderly buildup from the current base. Other important factors include public infrastructure, additional vehicle platforms, public education (including real time information on available products, subsidies, station locations, and how to go about obtaining a ZEV), and making all ZEV products available to retail customers.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000 Cost Estimates Today's ZEVs are more costly for manufacturers to make than any other vehicle technology being produced for sale between now and 2003. As noted above, most of that cost differential stems from the battery pack. The cost gap will narrow as technology improves and manufacturers move to volume production. However, there is no getting around the fact that near-term ZEVs will be relatively more expensive to produce. Staff estimates that the incremental costs for ZEVs in 2003 will range from $7,500 for City EVs, up to more than $20,000 for freeway capable ZEVs with advanced NiMH batteries. These calculations exclude the costs incurred for research and development of each ZEV model. Under an optimistic but nonetheless plausible scenario, battery EVs could become costcompetitive with conventional vehicles on a lifecycle cost basis. This scenario assumes volume production of more than 100,000 ZEVs. It is important to distinguish cost from price. Staff has estimated the cost of ZEV production to manufacturers, and the cost of operating ZEVs over their useful life. That is not the same as estimating the price at which various electric vehicles would be offered for sale. Price is set in a competitive environment and can differ from cost for several reasons. In initial years, manufacturers will not be able to recover the full cost of ZEV production through prices alone. This shortfall will be wholly borne by the automakers unless California offers full or partial subsidies to mitigate the revenue gap. During the MOA period, California provided $5,000 per vehicle ""buy down"" grants to offset the higher incremental cost of producing ZEVs. These grants were given to the auto manufacturers, who applied them as a discount to their ZEV lease or purchase prices. With some exceptions, the $5,000 grants were funded fifty/fifty by the California Energy Commission and local air pollution control districts. CEC's funding for this program came from the State's Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA), while districts have relied upon their motor vehicle registration fee surcharge revenues. Subsidies of up to $500 were also available for the installation of individual, at-home charging stations. Both of these financial incentive programs are funded only through FY 2000-2001. To support a significantly higher penetration of ZEV vehicles, California will need to continue its subsidy programsat least through the initial years. It will also be necessary to identify an alternate fund source. The State's entire PVEA account will be exhausted by the end of next year. Moreover, local air districts have multiple, competing claims on their vehicle registration fee revenue (including heavy-duty diesel clean-up programs) and are unlikely to be able to continue to allocate large amounts to ZEV subsidies. Environmental, Energy and Economic Benefits ZEVs provide comprehensive environmental, energy and societal benefits.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000  With respect to the environment, ZEVs are the ""gold standard"" for vehicular air pollution control. They reduce both criteria and toxic pollutant emissions to the maximum feasible levels. High-efficiency ZEVs and hybrid electric near-ZEVs also cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Finally, ZEVs minimize the multi-media impacts of vehicle operation, eliminating the need for a whole host of upstream petroleum refinery, storage and delivery activities. Admittedly, ZEVs have their own upstream impacts related to power generation and create new waste disposal issues. However, on an overall lifecycle basis, they are environmentally superior to conventional automobiles. As California's power generation system becomes increasingly cleaner, so too will the upstream emissions associated with ZEVs. Regarding energy use, vehicles powered by grid electricity increase the diversity of California's transportation energy system. This reduces the State's dependence on foreign oil and contributes to greater stability in the overall transportation fuels market. Advanced battery ZEVs and hybrid electric near-ZEV technologies are also highly efficient; reducing absolute energy demand per mile of vehicle operation. Finally, ZEVs have the potential to be powered by renewable sources of energy such as wind, hydropower or solar energy. The societal benefits of ZEVs include their clean, quiet operation in neighborhoods and on city streets. ZEVs can also benefit the State's economy. Because of their high technology leadership, California companies have the technical and scientific capability to play significant roles in the design, development and production of advanced technology zero emission components and vehicles. In public comments, automakers stated that the direct air quality benefits of the ZEV program are minor and, therefore, not worth the investment in electric cars. Staff recognizes that in the near-term, due to the small penetration of ZEVs and corresponding improvements in conventional cars, fleet-wide benefits will be modest. However, this is a long-term strategy. On a per vehicle basis, ZEVs are significantly cleaner than even the cleanest gasoline-powered alternative. They will steadily reduce emissions as their fleet penetration grows. Even more importantly, ZEVs have no risk of in-use emission control system failures. They are the only technology that is guaranteed to permanently reduce emissions over time. Conclusion California has made significant technological progress toward its zero emission objectives. More than two thousand battery EVs are on the road, illustrating that ZEVs can be built and deployed. There are a variety of attractive ZEV platforms. Also, their respective characteristics meet a wide range of market applications including fleets, small businesses and private commuting. While electric vehicle range is limited and recharging times are long, ZEVS are in everyday use in many different circumstances across the state. All evidence and testimony points to the fact that those who are using today's EVs are very pleased with their performance.   Staff Report - Executive Summary August 7, 2000  Progress has been less pronounced on the economic side. Staff's cost analysis concludes that both the initial and lifecycle costs of battery EVs will significantly exceed those of comparable conventional vehicles in the 2003 timeframe. However, in volume production and with improved technology, battery EVs could become competitive on a lifecycle cost basis. The near term cost premium for ZEVs is not surprising since every incremental step in pollution control provides benefits at a higher marginal cost. The ZEV program, moreover, is not a typical step-wise adjustment but a transformative leap forward. Given the sweeping nature of ZEVs' environmental, energy and societal effects, it is reasonable to expect that the program will be more expensive in its early years than more limited measures. At the same time, the fact that costs impose burdens must also be acknowledged. While higher costs persist, state subsidies could be very important to mitigate impacts on auto manufacturers and to nurture a growing ZEV market. The market for battery EVs is just starting to be understood and is very difficult to quantify. As noted above, the 2003 ZEV mandate represents a ten-fold increase in the number of actual battery EVs on the road. Placing all of those vehicles within a year or two and sustaining those sales in 2004, 2005 and beyond is a significant marketing challenge by anyone's measure. Staff has identified a number of applications that are well suited to using ZEVs and which could absorb several thousand units. Actual vehicle sales/leases will depend on consumer awareness and interest, available products and their net market price (minus any subsidies or tax incentives that may be provided). These factors suggest that much more extensive public education is needed. In addition, continuity of ZEV production is critical. Market acceptance cannot build, and volume production cannot be achieved, if ZEVs continue to be available only in boom and bust cycles. The 1996 MOA was a highly collaborative effort between the State of California, automakers, public utilities, local governments, fleet operators and many private ZEV enthusiasts who put their own dollars on the line. As ZEV penetration grows, this partnership needs to continue and expand. Teamwork among all the interested parties will increase the probability of success and hasten the advent of a truly self-sustaining ZEV market."
GX055-48-15058100	"Statement of   Lisa Callaghan   Northeast Advanced Vehicle Consortium   to the   Committee on the Judiciary   U.S. House of Representatives       for the hearing on   Solutions to Competitive Problems in the Oil Industry: Part 2         My name is Lisa Callaghan. I am a policy analyst at the Northeast Advanced Vehicle Consortium in Boston, Massachusetts. We are a non-profit organization that brings together private and public entities working to advance clean transportation technologies, including hybrid, electric and fuel cell systems for passenger vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles, in the Northeastern U.S.   I am pleased to be here today to talk about the important efforts underway by industry, and through industry/government partnerships, to introduce hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles to the U.S. market. These clean-car technologies offer the United States the promise of reduced energy consumption and improved air quality and public health.   Right now, the sudden increase in gas prices is focusing national attention on U.S. dependence on oil. Cars and trucks alone use two-thirds of all petroleum in the country. The transportation sector as a whole accounts for one-third of energy use in the U.S. And the primary vehicle technology in use – the internal combustion engine – is only about 18% efficient in real world use.   As we are seeing, our high energy consumption, and heavy dependency on oil to supply that energy, leaves us vulnerable to major shifts in price or supply. While there is currently much discussion of short-term responses to this problem, the long-term solution in the transportation arena is to develop commercially viable vehicles that cut gas consumption dramatically or are not powered by gasoline at all. Efforts to develop and commercialize these ""clean car"" technologies have been underway for years and will continue long after this current price spike is gone.   For example, Honda recently became the first car company to offer a hybrid-electric car to the U.S. market. Called the Insight, the car uses an electric motor in combination with a gas engine. It gets 61 mpg in the city, 70 mpg on the highway, topping EPA’s fuel economy rankings for model year 2000 cars. By comparison, the similarly-sized Honda Civic gets 28 mpg in city driving, 35 in highway driving. The Insight’s fuel savings results both from the hybrid propulsion system and the car’s extremely lightweight aluminum body.   Toyota has already been selling a mass-production hybrid in Japan for over two years. They introduced the Toyota Prius in December 1997, and since then, over 30,000 units of the Prius have been sold. In fact, monthly production had to be ramped up to meet the high demand. Toyota plans to introduce the Prius in the U.S. this summer. The 4-door, 5-passenger Prius uses an electric motor and a gas engine to achieve a combined fuel economy of approximately 55 mpg. It is also important to note that hybrids such as the Insight and the Prius offer performance comparable to gas cars and are being priced under $20,000, making them quite affordable.   Currently, all the other major automakers are also developing hybrids, using various platforms. Last year, DaimlerChrysler displayed a hybrid Dodge Durango. Although this hybrid SUV would only get 18.6 mpg, that is still a 20% improvement over the gas Durango’s 15.5 mpg. A recent Boston Globe article by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association calculated that a mere 20% increase in vehicle fuel efficiency could cut the average American family’s annual oil consumption by a few hundred gallons.   There are also efforts underway to transition the automobile away from gasoline entirely. All of the major automakers have offered battery-powered electric cars for sale or lease in the U.S., as do some smaller car manufacturers. Electric cars have no tailpipe emissions. And, because they get their energy from the power grid, they can take advantage of the move toward green energy sources like wind and solar – a move spurred, in part, by electric utility deregulation.   Automakers are also investing heavily in another type of electric car – fuel cell vehicles. A fuel cell produces electricity from the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, with water as the only by-product. While there are no pollutants and no carbon dioxide emissions associated with this technology, the first fuel cell cars to come to market will likely have emissions resulting from the process of generating hydrogen to power the car. However, in the long term, it is conceivable that these cars would become truly emission free. DaimlerChrysler has committed to introducing a production fuel cell car by 2004, although widespread availability of such cars is not likely to occur before 2010.   Electric motors, fuel cells, hydrogen fuel – this is what the future of the automobile industry looks like. And this prediction comes straight from the car companies themselves. GM chairman Jack Smith stated that ""(n)o car company will be able to thrive in the 21 st  century if it relies solely on the internal combustion engine."" Ford’s new chairman, William Clay Ford, has declared himself an environmentalist and is working to position Ford as the ""green car company."" Ford has competition for that title from Toyota and Honda, which have also been putting their green foot forward. Toyota’s president declared that ""(a)utomakers that deliver practical, greener products will command the market in the 21 st  century."" And full-page ads touting Honda’s line of environmentally friendly vehicles can be found in major national magazines.   As consumers, we should hold car companies to their commitments and reward them when they follow through. As companies like Ben & Jerry’s have shown, companies with a social conscience can attract an amazing degree of brand loyalty among customers.   And policymakers should be aware that these exciting developments are being spurred in part by intelligent government policy. Regulatory drivers, such as strict emissions and fuel economy standards, push the auto industry to continue to improve their products, as was the case with airbags, catalytic converters and bumper standards. And government programs that match private investment help companies conduct advanced technology research and demonstration.   These technologies represent an enormous economic opportunity for the U.S. – one that we should not let pass us by. In 1990, the global fleet was 430 million vehicles. By 2010, it could increase by roughly 50% to 650 million – much of that growth coming in countries like China and India. This increase is not sustainable using current internal combustion engine cars. The U.S. has the opportunity to become the world leader in providing advanced vehicle technologies to the global fleet.   Finally, I would like to mention that there are important efforts underway to make heavy-duty vehicles – such as trucks, buses and delivery vans – cleaner and more fuel efficient too. California and New York City have both made a commitment to transitioning their bus fleets to compressed natural gas. Also, New York recently announced that it plans to purchase 125 hybrid-electric buses for delivery in 2001 and 2002. The U.S. Postal Service will place 500 electric delivery vans, built by Ford, into its service routes beginning in the fall of 2000.   Re-making the automobile would seem like a long overdue effort. The internal combustion engine car of today is remarkably unchanged from its first, 19 th  century incarnation. While it has brought us incredible mobility, it also carries some heavy costs. Now is the time to make the automobile a 21 st  century technology.         NAVC   112 South St., 4 th  Floor, Boston, MA 02143   Phone: 617-482-1770, ext. 14   Fax: 617-482-1777   www.navc.org"
GX254-17-3441663	"State of California California Environmental Protection Agency AIR RESOURCES BOARD  STAFF REPORT 2000 ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAM BIENNIAL REVIEW  August 7, 2000  This document has been reviewed by the staff of the California Air Resources Board. Publication does not signify that the contents necessarily reflect the views and policies of the Air Resources Board.   Staff Report August 7, 2000 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 1990, California embarked on an ambitious strategy to reduce vehicle emissions to zero. This objective was to be achieved through the gradual introduction of electric vehicles into the California fleet. Specifically, the Air Resources Board mandated that at least 2 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent of new car sales be zero-emitting by 1998, 2001 and 2003, respectively. The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate for passenger cars has been adjusted twice since then, in 1996 and 1998. The underlying goal, however, has not changed. California remains committed to achieving zero emissions performance wherever feasible in the vehicle fleet. The challenge is determining how to achieve sustainable success in the field. As evidence of the State's commitment, California has partially subsidized the introduction of battery electric vehicles through grants and fleet purchases. That support is expected to continue. The rationale for California's commitment is simple. Zero-emission technology is necessary to achieve the State's public health protection goals. Health-based state and federal air quality standards continue to be exceeded in regions throughout California, and more areas of the State are likely to be designated as nonattainment with promulgation of the new federal eight-hour ozone standard. California's burgeoning population and robust economy mean continued upward pressure on statewide emissions. Manufacturing, power generation, petroleum refining, goods transport, home heating and cooling, personal mobility and a wide range of human activities all have direct air pollution consequences. Accomplishing zero emissions in any of these source categories (or portion thereof) mitigates their adverse impacts and protects human health. Zero-emission technologies also transcend some of the persistent problems with conventional air pollution sources. Combustion-based engines are inherently higher emitting and prone to deterioration over time. Catastrophic failures are also a concern. Older gasoline-powered vehicles, for example, become gross emitters if their emission control systems fail. Combustible fuels also have significant ""upstream"" impacts. Refining, fuel storage and delivery all have associated emissions from both routine operations, accidents (breakdowns, fuel spills), and ongoing compliance problems (e.g., leaking underground tanks). Apart from upset conditions that may occur during electric power generation, zero emission vehicles have none of these vulnerabilities. A battery powered electric car will remain emission-free throughout its useful life.  i   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Current ZEV Mandate ARB regulations require that 10 percent of the new light-duty vehicles offered for sale in California for model year 2003 be zero emitting. This requirement applies to intermediate and large volume vehicle manufacturers only. Manufacturers have significant flexibility in meeting the ZEV requirements. Auto companies can earn extra ZEV credits by introducing vehicles before 2003, thereby reducing their total obligation. Extra credit is also available for battery electric vehicles with more than a 100 mile range per charge. Manufacturers may also delay compliance by one year provided they produce two years' worth of ZEVs by the end of 2004. Finally, large manufacturers can satisfy up to 6 percent of the 10 percent ZEV requirement with near-zero emitting technologies, and intermediate manufacturers may meet the entire 10 percent obligation via that route (producing no electric vehicles at all). Eleven auto manufacturers are expected to qualify as ""intermediate"" in 2003: BMW, Hyundai, Isuzu, Jaguar, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Rover, Subaru (Fuji), Volkswagen and Volvo. Six auto companies are expected to qualify as ""large"" in 2003: DaimlerChrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. If no change is made to today's ZEV regulation, staff estimates that approximately 22,000 electric vehicles would need to be offered for sale in 2003 to meet a four percent ZEV requirement. However, this total could change significantly, up or down, based on each manufacturer's actual production decisions and their chosen compliance path. As noted above, early ZEV introduction or the use of additional vehicles with extended range would decrease the 2003 obligation. Reduced reliance on PZEVs, on the other hand, would increase the number of ZEVs needed. The ZEV mandate continues in 2004 and each year thereafter. Again, if the rule is unchanged, staff estimates ZEV availability will grow gradually over time, reaching 31,000 to 78,000 units (4 percent to 10 percent) by 2006. The September 2000 Biennial Review When the ZEV mandate was adopted in 1990, electric vehicles were in a very early stage of development. To ensure successful implementation, the Board directed staff to report biennially on the status of technological progress. The September 2000 biennial review is the fifth in-depth examination of the technical and economic issues related to ZEVs. Since auto makers generally need three years' lead time for production, this biennial review is also the last significant opportunity to assess their readiness for meeting the 2003 requirements. This report describes the current status of ZEV technology and the prospects for near- and long-term improvement. The analysis is based upon experience  ii   Staff Report August 7, 2000 gained through the 1996 Memorandum of Agreement (see below), staff meetings with each of the affected manufacturers, contract work performed by outside experts, and extensive comments received at two public workshops conducted earlier this year. 1996 Memorandum of Agreement The original ZEV mandate called for 2 percent penetration in 1998 (approximately 20,000 vehicles). However, in 1996, the ARB determined that a smaller introduction was warranted given the status of electric vehicle technology at the time. Accordingly, the ARB's Executive Officer entered into Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with large volume manufacturers to produce a limited number of ZEVs, specifically 3,750 vehicles between calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Multiple credits for advanced batteries reduced the total legal commitment to just over 1,800 electric vehicles. Today there are approximately 2,300 electric vehicles on the road in California. The products are highly attractive, high performing and range in style from vans, pick-up trucks, sport utility vehicles and station wagons to two-seater sports cars. All of these electric vehicles were introduced within the last four years. The only significant gap is the absence of a 4-door, 5-passenger ZEV sedan, which no manufacturer is currently producing. Although the market is just forming, customer interest is encouraging and suggests that additional demand exists for ZEV products. Unfortunately, the full extent of this demand cannot be quantified because very few electric vehicles are available. Those manufacturers who have met their quotas have largely ceased production. Companies still making ZEVs have encountered production delays and are mostly marketing to fleets. This virtual ""black out"" condition was not anticipated when the MOAs were signed in 1996. It also complicates staff's analysis of market readiness for 22,000 ZEVs in 2003. When even the most motivated customers cannot obtain electric vehicles, the ability to gauge broader consumer interest and acceptance are severely diminished. The primary reason for the ""black out"" is cost. Manufacturers are not yet able to produce a competitively priced electric vehicle without incurring significant losses on each unit leased or sold. The secondary reason is uncertainty. Car companies are unwilling to invest in volume production until they see the business case for each ZEV model, a certain market, and a definitive regulatory signal from the State.  iii   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Implementation of Year 2003 Requirements 1. Vehicle Technology Assessment  There is no technological barrier to building battery powered ZEVs; the issue is cost and consumer acceptance. With regard to near-zero emission vehicles, technology exists which allows vehicles to achieve the required level of performance. Several manufacturers have stated, however, that due to lead time considerations they will not be able to build enough PZEVs to take full advantage of the partial ZEV option in 2003. If they cannot overcome those challenges, more battery electric vehicles will be needed to meet the 10 percent ZEV mandate. Hybrid vehicles are an environmentally attractive product and could achieve near-zero (PZEV) emissions performance in the near future. Finally, hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles have potential to become an additional pure ZEV technology, but will not be commercially available by 2003. These conclusions are explained in more detail below. Battery electric vehicles are clearly technologically feasible. Seven models are on the road including GM's EV1 2-seat sports car; the Chevrolet S-10 and Ford Ranger pick-up trucks; Honda's EV PLUS (a 4-seat, 2-door platform comparable to Honda's CRV), the Toyota RAV4 sport utility vehicle; Nissan's Altra EV station wagon; and the DaimlerChrysler EPIC minivan. In addition, several classes of smaller battery electric vehicles are emerging. These include low-speed vehicles (LSVs, also referred to as ""neighborhood electric vehicles"" or NEVs) and lowrange vehicles designed for in-city driving (City EVs). Examples of the latter include the Ford TH!NK, the Toyota E-COM, and Nissan's Hyper-Mini. All of these vehicles qualify as ZEVs under the current ARB regulation. Regarding PZEVs, the leading candidates are extremely clean gasoline-powered cars, with or without hybrid electric drive-train technology. To qualify for PZEV credit, a vehicle must be certified to the super ultra low emission level (SULEV) exhaust standards, have zero evaporative emissions, and come with a 150,000 mile warranty. To date, only the Nissan Sentra has achieved PZEV status. Three other vehicles (Honda Accord, Honda Civic GX, and Toyota Prius) have attained the SULEV criteria, but have not met the remaining requirements. Both large and intermediate volume manufacturers are concerned about their ability to overcome all the engineering challenges implicit in the PZEV criteria by 2003. If they cannot reach that objective, up to the full 10 percent of battery electric cars may be required. Staff concurs that the PZEV criteria are extremely challenging and that some manufacturers will be unable to take full advantage of the PZEV option in 2003. Hybrid electric vehicles are the newest entrants to the advanced vehicle field. These vehicles combine batteries, a supplemental electric drive train, and a downsized conventional fuel tank to increase overall efficiency. Hybrid vehicles consume less fuel per mile of operation, thereby reducing upstream  iv   Staff Report August 7, 2000 environmental impacts and releases of climate changing gases. Hybrid vehicles may also be low, ultra low or super ultra low emitting if they are designed to meet those respective exhaust standards. Two hybrid vehicles are currently available: the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius. Although neither qualifies for PZEV credit at this time, there is no inherent technological reason why hybrids cannot achieve PZEV performance. The main obstacle is the time needed to design, test and perfect the necessary emission controls. Fuel cell vehicle (FCV) technology has the potential to be zero emitting when powered by pure hydrogen from a relatively clean source. The California Fuel Cell Partnership is examining the potential for commercializing such technology, along with other FCV fuel types. A few prototype vehicles are available for testing and demonstration. 2. Battery Technology Assessment  Batteries are the single most expensive component of electric vehicles. For that reason, affordable battery packs--both today and when produced in volume--are crucial to achieving a sustainable electric vehicle market. ARB's existing regulations also place a premium on advanced (long-range) battery technology. This preference was based on early survey results and upon staff's judgment that electric vehicles with greater than 100 mile range will sell better, to more people and for more uses, than shorter range vehicles. ARB contracted with a team of outside experts to obtain the best available information on battery advances, costs and future trends. The Battery Panel concluded that nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries were the most promising advanced technology, having both high performance and the longest useful life. Unfortunately, the Panel also concluded that battery costs are high and will not meet cost-competitive targets for some time. Although volume production will help, a breakthrough is needed to achieve truly affordable NiMH packs. Several commenters have suggested that ARB revisit its preference for advanced battery technology. Lead acid (PbA) batteries, they suggest, could meet market needs at a far lower cost. Their justification is two-fold. First, several EV drivers testified at staff workshops that that their actual driving needs were lower than they anticipated before they leased a ZEV and that they would not pay a premium for greater range. In addition, some auto manufacturers are closely examining the business case for lead-acid based City Cars that would be overtly marketed as limited range, niche vehicles. The opposing view is that advanced batteries meet a broader range of driving needs, produce less waste (since they last longer), and may ultimately serve a larger consumer market.  v   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3. Infrastructure Assessment  Unlike conventional vehicles, battery powered ZEVs do not require an extensive ""fueling"" infrastructure since most customers will recharge at work or at home. The availability of public charging stations is nonetheless extremely important because of its influence on consumer confidence and acceptance. Public chargers also enable ZEV owners to drive longer distances, and to reach more destinations than they otherwise might. The public infrastructure for electric vehicles continues to expand in California. Currently, there are about 400 public charging stations statewide with approximately 700 separate chargers. Most of these were constructed with a combination of government and electric utility funds. Recently, a few private companies have begun to offer electric charging services to their customers. The most notable example is Costco, which has a corporate-wide ""all electric"" philosophy. Staff expects these services to expand as additional local governments and private companies embrace electric vehicle technologies. The most difficult issue affecting public charging infrastructure is the absence of uniform charging standards or equipment. A little more than half of the chargers are inductive; the rest are conductive. Current vehicles use a 220 volt system. When City Cars come to market, they will introduce the need for a new minimum voltage of 110. There is no easy way around this dilemma. Because the chargers are integrally linked to vehicle design and have competitive characteristics, manufacturers are unwilling and may actually be unable to move toward full standardization. Fast charging has minivan and holds economic barrier: extensive financial battery packs that 4. been successfully demonstrated in the DaimlerChrysler EPIC great promise for the future. However, there is a significant fast charging is more expensive per station and would require support to implement. Fast chargers also require special can receive rapid charging without producing excessive heat.  Market Assessment  There is significant disagreement over the extent of market demand for electric vehicles. Manufacturers assert that the lack of leases during the first years when vehicles were available means that the market can only absorb a few hundred ZEVs per year. Electric vehicle advocates and fleet operators point to current waiting lists as evidence of strong customer interest and pent-up demand. Staff views this as the most difficult area in which to develop reliable estimates. The entire market is new and product availability has been constrained such that true consumer interest is exceedingly difficult to gauge. The recent emergence of fundamentally new ZEVsnamely city cars and neighborhood EVsfurther complicates staff's assessment. Although the  vi   Staff Report August 7, 2000 business case for inexpensive, in-town EVs appears to be promising, there is as yet no market experience for selling these products in the U.S. Manufacturers will have to start from scratch in building consumer awareness and interest. Left unchanged, the current ZEV requirement will result in approximately 22,000 electric vehicles by 2003. That represents almost a ten-fold increase over the number of ZEVs on the road in California today. The quantity of ZEVs will grow in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as ZEV production ramps up per the current ARB regulation. Whether all of these vehicles can be successfully marketed and placed is a key issue facing the Board. Studies and surveys indicate that the primary factors affecting EV market demand are range, recharge time and competitive pricing. Based on experience to date and public testimony, staff has identified several other factors that are critical to ongoing success. The single greatest need is for near term ZEV availability, followed by a smooth, orderly buildup from the current base. Other important factors include public infrastructure, additional vehicle platforms, public education (including real time information on available products, subsidies, station locations, and how to go about obtaining a ZEV), and making all ZEV products available to retail customers. Cost Estimates Today's ZEVs are more costly for manufacturers to make than any other vehicle technology being produced for sale between now and 2003. As noted above, most of that cost differential stems from the battery pack. The cost gap will narrow as technology improves and manufacturers move to volume production. However, there is no getting around the fact that near-term ZEVs will be relatively more expensive to produce. Staff estimates that the incremental costs for ZEVs in 2003 will range from $7,500 for City EVs, up to more than $20,000 for freeway capable ZEVs with advanced NiMH batteries. These calculations exclude the costs incurred for research and development of each ZEV model. Under an optimistic but nonetheless plausible scenario, battery EVs could become cost-competitive with conventional vehicles on a lifecycle cost basis. This scenario assumes volume production of more than 100,000 ZEVs. It is important to distinguish cost from price. Staff has estimated the cost of ZEV production to manufacturers, and the cost of operating ZEVs over their useful life. That is not the same as estimating the price at which various electric vehicles would be offered for sale. Price is set in a competitive environment and can differ from cost for several reasons. In initial years, manufacturers will not be able to recover the full cost of ZEV production through prices alone. This shortfall will be wholly borne by the automakers unless California offers full or partial subsidies to mitigate the revenue gap.  vii   Staff Report August 7, 2000 During the MOA period, California provided $5,000 per vehicle ""buy down"" grants to offset the higher incremental cost of producing ZEVs. These grants were given to the auto manufacturers, who applied them as a discount to their ZEV lease or purchase prices. With some exceptions, the $5,000 grants were funded fifty/fifty by the California Energy Commission and local air pollution control districts. CEC's funding for this program came from the State's Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA), while districts have relied upon their motor vehicle registration fee surcharge revenues. Subsidies of up to $500 were also available for the installation of individual, at-home charging stations. Both of these financial incentive programs are funded only through FY 2000-2001. To support a significantly higher penetration of ZEV vehicles, California will need to continue its subsidy programsat least through the initial years. It will also be necessary to identify an alternate fund source. The State's entire PVEA account will be exhausted by the end of next year. Moreover, local air districts have multiple, competing claims on their vehicle registration fee revenue (including heavy-duty diesel clean-up programs) and are unlikely to be able to continue to allocate large amounts to ZEV subsidies. Environmental, Energy and Economic Benefits ZEVs provide comprehensive environmental, energy and societal benefits. With respect to the environment, ZEVs are the ""gold standard"" for vehicular air pollution control. They reduce both criteria and toxic pollutant emissions to the maximum feasible levels. High-efficiency ZEVs and hybrid electric near-ZEVs also cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Finally, ZEVs minimize the multi-media impacts of vehicle operation, eliminating the need for a whole host of upstream petroleum refinery, storage and delivery activities. Admittedly, ZEVs have their own upstream impacts related to power generation and create new waste disposal issues. However, on an overall lifecycle basis, they are environmentally superior to conventional automobiles. As California's power generation system becomes increasingly cleaner, so too will the upstream emissions associated with ZEVs. Regarding energy use, vehicles powered by grid electricity increase the diversity of California's transportation energy system. This reduces the State's dependence on foreign oil and contributes to greater stability in the overall transportation fuels market. Advanced battery ZEVs and hybrid electric nearZEV technologies are also highly efficient; reducing absolute energy demand per mile of vehicle operation. Finally, ZEVs have the potential to be powered by renewable sources of energy such as wind, hydropower or solar energy. The societal benefits of ZEVs include their clean, quiet operation in neighborhoods and on city streets. ZEVs can also benefit the State's economy. Because of their high technology leadership, California companies have the  viii   Staff Report August 7, 2000 technical and scientific capability to play significant roles in the design, development and production of advanced technology zero emission components and vehicles. In public comments, automakers stated that the direct air quality benefits of the ZEV program are minor and, therefore, not worth the investment in electric cars. Staff recognizes that in the near-term, due to the small penetration of ZEVs and corresponding improvements in conventional cars, fleet-wide benefits will be modest. However, this is a long-term strategy. On a per vehicle basis, ZEVs are significantly cleaner than even the cleanest gasoline-powered alternative. They will steadily reduce emissions as their fleet penetration grows. Even more importantly, ZEVs have no risk of in-use emission control system failures. They are the only technology that is guaranteed to permanently reduce emissions over time. Conclusion California has made significant technological progress toward its zero emission objectives. More than two thousand battery EVs are on the road, illustrating that ZEVs can be built and deployed. There are a variety of attractive ZEV platforms. Also, their respective characteristics meet a wide range of market applications including fleets, small businesses and private commuting. While electric vehicle range is limited and recharging times are long, ZEVS are in everyday use in many different circumstances across the state. All evidence and testimony points to the fact that those who are using today's EVs are very pleased with their performance. Progress has been less pronounced on the economic side. Staff's cost analysis concludes that both the initial and lifecycle costs of battery EVs will significantly exceed those of comparable conventional vehicles in the 2003 timeframe. However, in volume production and with improved technology, battery EVs could become competitive on a lifecycle cost basis. The near term cost premium for ZEVs is not surprising since every incremental step in pollution control provides benefits at a higher marginal cost. The ZEV program, moreover, is not a typical step-wise adjustment but a transformative leap forward. Given the sweeping nature of ZEVs' environmental, energy and societal effects, it is reasonable to expect that the program will be more expensive in its early years than more limited measures. At the same time, the fact that costs impose burdens must also be acknowledged. While higher costs persist, state subsidies could be very important to mitigate impacts on auto manufacturers and to nurture a growing ZEV market. The market for battery EVs is just starting to be understood and is very difficult to quantify. As noted above, the 2003 ZEV mandate represents a ten-fold increase in the number of actual battery EVs on the road. Placing all of those vehicles  ix   Staff Report August 7, 2000 within a year or two and sustaining those sales in 2004, 2005 and beyond is a significant marketing challenge by anyone's measure. Staff has identified a number of applications that are well suited to using ZEVs and which could absorb several thousand units. Actual vehicle sales/leases will depend on consumer awareness and interest, available products and their net market price (minus any subsidies or tax incentives that may be provided). These factors suggest that much more extensive public education is needed. In addition, continuity of ZEV production is critical. Market acceptance cannot build, and volume production cannot be achieved, if ZEVs continue to be available only in boom and bust cycles. The 1996 MOA was a highly collaborative effort between the State of California, automakers, public utilities, local governments, fleet operators and many private ZEV enthusiasts who put their own dollars on the line. As ZEV penetration grows, this partnership needs to continue and expand. Teamwork among all the interested parties will increase the probability of success and hasten the advent of a truly self-sustaining ZEV market.  x   Staff Report August 7, 2000 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1

due to continued progress in controlling pollution from motor vehicles. Faced with ever more stringent regulations, vehicle manufacturers have made remarkable advances in vehicle technology. Several thousand zero-emission vehicles are now in everyday service on California roads, and the latest conventional internal combustion engine vehicles achieve emission levels that seemed impossible just a few short years ago. Despite this progress, however, air quality in many areas of the state still does not meet federal or state health-based ambient air quality standards. Mobile sources still are responsible for well over half the ozone-forming emissions in California. The relative contribution of passenger cars and small trucks is expected to decline over time as new standards phase in , but in 2020 such vehicles will still be responsible for about 10 percent of total emissions. State and federal law requires the implementation of control strategies to attain ambient air quality standards as quickly as practicable. Mobile sources are also the primary source of emissions of toxic air contaminants in California, and a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The facilities needed to refuel the current vehicle fleet (service stations, bulk terminals, refineries) are significant sources of smog precursors, air toxics, water pollution, and hazardous waste. 1.2 The Zero Emission Vehicle Program  The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program was originally adopted in 1990, as part of the first ARB Low-Emission Vehicle regulations. The ZEV program is an integral part of California's mobile source control efforts, and is intended to encourage the development of advanced technologies that will secure increasing air quality benefits for California now and into the future. ZEVs have significant long-term benefits because they have no emission control equipment that can deteriorate or fail, and generate only minimal ""upstream"" refueling and fuel cycle emissions. Under the 1990 regulations, the seven largest auto manufacturers were required to produce ZEVs beginning with model year 1998. In model years 1998 through 2000, two percent of the vehicles offered for sale in California by large volume manufacturers were to be ZEVs, and this percentage was to increase to five percent in model years 2001 and 2002, and ten percent in model years 2003 and beyond. In 1996 the ARB modified the regulations to allow additional time for the technology to develop. The requirement for ten percent ZEVs in model years 2003 and beyond  1   Staff Report August 7, 2000 was maintained, but the sales requirement for model years 1998 through 2002 was eliminated. At that same time, the ARB entered into Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with the seven largest vehicle manufacturers. Under the MOAs the manufacturers must place more than 1,800 advanced-battery EVs in California in the years 1998 through 2000, and the ARB must work with state and local governments to help develop ZEV infrastructure and remove barriers to ZEV introduction. In 1998 the ARB provided additional flexibility in the ZEV program by allowing additional types of vehicles to be used to meet program requirements. Under the 1998 amendments, manufacturers can use extremely clean advanced-technology vehicles (referred to as ""partial"" ZEVs) to meet the 10 percent ZEV requirement, except that large-volume manufacturers must, at a minimum, have 4 percent of their sales be vehicles classified as ""full"" ZEVs. 1.3 ARB Long-Term Vision  Simply put, continued reliance on today's technology will not allow California to reach its health-based air quality goals. In ARB's vision of the future, therefore, the entire vehicle fleet will produce zero tailpipe emissions, and will use fuels with minimal ""fuel cycle"" emissions (emissions that occur due to vehicle refueling and the related production or transportation of fuel). As an ancillary benefit to the advanced technologies employed, the future vehicle fleet also will be highly energy efficient, use diverse energy sources, and will result in reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. In considering the ZEV program, it is essential to keep this long-term perspective firmly in mind In public comments, manufacturers have stated that they do not expect to see a zero emission fleet in any reasonable planning timeframe. Manufacturers do expect that in the future, global customer demands will reward companies that can meet society's transportation needs while eliminating harmful environmental impacts. 1.3.1 Continued Emphasis on Zero Emissions Battery-powered electric vehicles and other ZEVs such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles hold distinct air quality advantages over technologies that use a conventional fuel such as gasoline in a combustion engine. High volatility liquid fuels such as gasoline are responsible for significant fuel cycle emissions. Vehicles with combustion engines inevitably exhibit deterioration that results in increased emission levels as the vehicle ages. They are also subject to becoming gross polluters if critical emission control systems fail. Although new vehicles have more durable emission control systems and on-board diagnostic systems that are effective in alerting owners to emission related problems, owners may not respond to failure signals promptly. The inspection and maintenance program will not capture vehicles that are operated without being  2   Staff Report August 7, 2000 registered, and repair cost limits may permit continued operation of some high emitting vehicles. For all of these reasons, vehicles with no potential to produce emissions are the ""gold standard"" of even the cleanest, most advanced new technologies. The commercialization of ZEVs is critical to the long-term success of California's clean air program. Even with the full implementation of the LEV II program, emissions from light duty vehicles will still represent some 10 percent of total emissions in the South Coast Air Basin. Achieving the new air quality standards for particulate matter, not to mention the state ozone standard, will require further reductions. Taking into account the anticipated growth in the number of lightduty vehicles and the number of miles they travel each day, it is clear that we need to eliminate emissions related to vehicle deterioration and fuel use from a significant portion of the light-duty vehicle fleet. ZEVs can accomplish this goal. 1.3.2 Near-Zero Technologies Also Play a Major Role The ZEV requirements have been instrumental in promoting battery, fuel cell, component and vehicle research and development. These requirements have also been successful in spawning a large variety of extremely low-emission vehicle technologies. Many of these technologies have at least some of the desirable qualities inherent to ZEVs, such as extremely low emissions of smog precursors and toxic air contaminants, reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, extended durability, or high efficiency. Such vehicles will play a major role in achieving further air quality improvement. First of all, many of the technologies can be adopted at relatively low cost. For example, staff estimates the incremental cost of going from a SULEV to a PZEV to be about $500. Vehicles using these technologies thus have the potential for widespread early market penetration. Although the near-ZEV vehicles are not as clean as ZEVs, if produced in large numbers they provide a significant air quality benefit relative to the conventional vehicles that they replace. Second, because many of these vehicles use components also found on zero emission vehicles (e.g. battery packs, controllers, and electric drive), volume production of near-zero vehicles will help reduce the cost of components used on zero emission vehicles and hasten their commercialization. 1.3.3 Linkage to Broader Issues The mission of the Air Resources Board is to protect public health through the reduction of air pollution. The Board's primary focus is on the reduction of smogforming pollutants and toxic air contaminants. To date, most discussion of ZEV air quality impacts has focused on their smog benefits.  3   Staff Report August 7, 2000 In addition to their dramatic reduction in smog-forming pollutants, ZEVs also provide reductions in the emissions of toxic air contaminants. The benefits of reductions in toxic air contaminants are felt statewide. Recognizing that mobile source pollution from highway traffic may disproportionately affect nearby inner city and low-income neighborhoods, reductions in toxic emissions from motor vehicles can also help address community level public health concerns. Above and beyond these traditional air pollution benefits, ZEVs can also make significant positive contributions in other environmental areas. For example, the use of alternative fuels can reduce the multimedia impact of fuel spillage on water quality, and can increase the diversity of California's energy supply. The smooth, quiet operation of electric drive vehicles can improve the quality of life in crowded urban areas. Electricity and hydrogen, which can be used to power ZEVs, can be produced from renewable resources such as solar, wind or hydropower, or biomass feedstocks. Thus these technologies can help pave the way towards a sustainable energy future. Perhaps the most important ancillary benefit, though, is that high-efficiency ZEVs and hybrid electric near-ZEVs can lead to significant reductions in emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The Air Resources Board does not currently regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. The Board is, however, working with the California Energy Commission to better understand the contribution of mobile sources to total greenhouse gas emissions, and quantify the climate change impact of various fuels and vehicle technologies. Even in the absence of specific regulatory requirements it is clear that, other things being equal, technologies that achieve lower greenhouse gas emissions are the preferred alternative. Meanwhile, auto manufacturers worldwide are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their vehicles in keeping with the Kyoto Protocol and other requirements in place or pending in other markets. ZEVs can benefit California's economy as well as our public health. Because of their high-technology leadership, California companies have the technical and scientific capability to play a significant role in the design, development and production of advanced technology zero emission components and vehicles. ARB is currently developing estimates of some of the economic benefits of the ZEV program. ZEVs thus have the capability to provide comprehensive environmental, energy and societal benefits. While the Board's consideration of the ZEV regulation is firmly rooted in its air quality mandate and authority, the Board is aware of the multi-faceted effects of its policy choices. Over the long term the Board, in cooperation with its sister agencies, will devote increasing attention to an integrated consideration of such broader issues.  4   Staff Report August 7, 2000 1.4 Progress Since the 1998 Biennial Review  Perhaps the best way to characterize progress over the two years since the last Biennial Review is to say that EVs have rapidly moved into widespread real world applications. In July of 1998, when the last Biennial Review staff report was released, manufacturers had just introduced their vehicles. On March 29, 2000, numerous enthusiastic EV drivers arrived en masse in their leased vehicles to testify at the ZEV Review workshop in Sacramento. Others arrived in rental electric vehicles they had picked up at the Sacramento airport. On that same day, dozens of EVs were at work elsewhere in the Sacramento area for a variety of state and local agencies. Down Interstate 80 in West Sacramento, plans were underway for a groundbreaking ceremony for the headquarters of the California Fuel Cell Partnership. In Los Angeles, electric minivans were in use shuttling passengers to and from Los Angeles International Airport. In Yosemite Valley, two electric vehicles provided zero emission mobility for park staff and visitors. In the Bay Area, San Diego, Ventura, the Gold Country, the San Joaquin Valley, Los Angeles, and elsewhere around the state, electric vehicles were in daily use. Some specific highlights of recent progress include:          More than 2,300 electric vehicles in a variety of configurations have been delivered for lease or sale in California. All of the required MOA vehicles produced to date have been successfully leased. At present there are more interested customers than there are vehicles available. General Motors has released the ""Generation II"" NiMH version of the EV1, featuring a range of 142 miles, and a NiMH version of the S-10 pickup. DaimlerChrysler released a NiMH version of the EPIC minivan. EPIC minivans using fast charge are in daily use by Xpress Shuttle serving passengers at Los Angeles International Airport. Ford has released a NiMH version of the Ranger pickup. Ford has created a Th!nk subsidiary to market advanced technology vehicles, and has announced plans to market City and neighborhood sized EVs. Ford introduced an innovative and successful program to market the EV Ranger to schools and parks at a reduced rate of $199 per month. The United States Postal Service has ordered 500 electric vehicles, based on the Ford Ranger platform, for mail delivery in California. Honda has begun to re-market vehicles after the expiration of the original three year lease, resulting in additional zero emission miles of service. Most of these vehicles are being re-leased by the original drivers, giving evidence of high customer satisfaction. Toyota has introduced vehicles with a second generation, smaller, inductive charging paddle. Nissan has introduced the first electric vehicle powered by lithium-ion batteries. 5      Staff Report August 7, 2000     Nissan has introduced a Sentra vehicle that meets partial ZEV credit requirements. Manufacturers have continued to refine and improve power control electronics, electric drivetrains, and other components. For example, General Motors is developing a Generation III electric drivetrain. Southern California Edison operates a fleet of 320 EVs, which has logged more than 3.5 million miles of service. As of July 1, 2000, electric vehicles that have secured the appropriate permit sticker from the California Department of Motor Vehicles are authorized to travel in High Occupancy Vehicle lanes regardless of the number of occupants. Under recent legislation, the registration fee paid by electric vehicles is now no greater than that of a comparable conventional vehicle. More than 120 public fleets around the state have used EVs under the ARB's Electric Vehicle Loan Program, and several California utility companies have conducted highly successful loan programs within their jurisdictions. State and local government fleets have made major purchase commitments. EVs are available for rent at the Los Angeles, Ontario and Sacramento airports and in Beverly Hills, and will soon be available at the Burbank and Orange County airports as well as downtown Sacramento. Significant public infrastructure continues to be installed around the state. The California Fuel Cell Partnership has been formed, with the goal of demonstrating fuel cell vehicle technology and alternative fuel infrastructure over the next four years. Automakers and the public sector have supported the ZEV program with significant incentives for vehicles and for infrastructure. The 2000 Biennial Review Process          1.5  When the ZEV requirement was adopted in 1990, low- and zero-emission vehicle technology was in a very early stage of development. The Board acknowledged that many issues would need to be addressed prior to the implementation date. Thus the Board directed staff to provide an update on the ZEV program on a biennial basis, in order to provide a context for the necessary policy discussion and deliberation. The next biennial review of the ZEV program is scheduled for September 2000. The ARB is committed to working closely with all interested parties to ensure that they have an opportunity to provide comments and suggestions throughout the review process. The key milestones of the review process have been as follows: March 29, 2000 Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review Sacramento Public Workshop Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements 6  March 30, 2000   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Sacramento May 31-June 1, 2000 Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review Diamond Bar Staff Report released to the public Board Meeting  August 7, 2000 September 7, 2000 1.6  The Purpose of This Document  In preparing for the Board's upcoming Biennial Review, the goal of the staff is to provide a thorough, accurate portrayal of the current status of ZEV technology and the prospects for improvement in the near- and long-term. Staff efforts have included meetings with vehicle manufacturers, environmental groups, and other interested parties, on-site visits to the large vehicle manufacturers in Japan and in Michigan, discussions with EV drivers, and research on current and pending technologies and their environmental impacts. ARB also has contracted with outside technical experts to review the state of battery technology and production costs, and assess the full fuel cycle emissions and energy efficiency of various vehicle types and fuel sources. This document is descriptive rather than proscriptive--it does not draw conclusions or make recommendations. Rather, the purpose of this Staff Report is to put forth technical information, and provide a framework and context for the Board's consideration of the relevant issues. 1.7 Public Comments  At the March 2000 public workshop, three public comment sessions were conducted. These sessions addressed the preliminary staff assessment, the EV driver experience, and advances in ZEV technology. Seventy-three individuals testified at the workshop, and staff received nearly forty additional written submittals. At the May 2000 workshop, sessions addressed the EV market, the report of the Battery Technology Advisory Panel, environmental benefits, and cost. More than 100 individuals testified, and numerous separate written submittals have been provided. In seeking public comment, staff hoped to identify areas where the staff report could be strengthened or improved, and bring to light issues that the public believes should be highlighted for the Board's consideration. The extensive public comment provided has been valuable during preparation of this Staff Report. Information provided as part of public comment is incorporated or noted as appropriate throughout the body of the Staff Report.  7   Staff Report August 7, 2000 2 2.1 MANUFACTURER STATUS Introduction  The ZEV requirement applies to large and intermediate volume manufacturers (defined below). Beginning in model year (MY) 2003, at least 10 percent of the passenger cars and light duty trucks below 3,750 pounds gross vehicle weight produced and delivered for sale in California by large and intermediate volume manufacturers must be ZEVs. An intermediate volume manufacturer may meet this ZEV requirement entirely with partial ZEV allowance vehicles (defined in Section 4.3.1) or credits generated by such vehicles. A large volume manufacturer must meet at least 40 percent of its ZEV requirement with pure ZEVs, full ZEV allowance vehicles, or credits generated by such vehicles. Large volume manufacturers may, at their option, meet the remaining 60 percent of their ZEV requirement with partial allowance vehicles or credits generated by such vehicles. A small volume manufacturer is not required to meet the percentage ZEV requirements, but may earn and market credits for the ZEVs or ZEV allowance vehicles it produces and delivers for sale in California. 2.2 Manufacturer Volume Classifications  Because MY 2003 is quickly approaching and production planning is well underway, ARB staff has attempted to establish each manufacturer's volume classification and, thus, each manufacturer's ZEV requirement. For purposes of classification for 2003, small volume manufacturers are defined as those with California sales below 4,500 per year, using the average number of vehicles sold over the preceding three years. Small volume manufacturers are not subject to the ZEV requirement. Based on current production and sales data, ARB staff expects the small volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:          Dae Woo Ferrari GFI Lamborghini Lotus Porsche Rolls Royce Saab Suzuki  Intermediate volume manufacturers are defined for 2003 as those with California sales between 4,501 and 35,000 light and medium duty vehicles per year, again averaged over the preceding three years. Based on the same data, ARB staff expects the intermediate volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:  8   Staff Report August 7, 2000            BMW Subaru (Fuji) Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Kia Mazda Mitsubishi Rover Volkswagen Volvo  Large volume manufacturers are defined as those that are not small volume manufacturers or intermediate volume manufacturers. Based on the same data, ARB staff expects the large manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:       DaimlerChrysler Ford GM Honda Nissan Toyota  During public comment at the March workshop, one manufacturer recommended that the minimum annual sales threshold for a large manufacturer be increased above the current level of 35,000. This manufacturer noted that automakers just above this cutoff are far more limited in resources than the existing large manufacturers, who typically have annual California sales of at least 100,000 and often substantially more. Another manufacturer made a similar recommendation, with similar reasoning, regarding the minimum annual sales threshold for an intermediate volume manufacturer, currently set at 4,500. Representatives of several intermediate volume manufacturers testified that due to constraints imposed by the planned dates for introduction of new engines and vehicle platforms, they would not be able to produce the required number of PZEVs as early as 2003. 2.3 Potential Classification Changes  Although previously categorized as a large-volume manufacturer, Mazda has consistently been selling fewer than 35,000 vehicles in California in recent years. Mazda will be considered an intermediate volume manufacturer beginning in MY 2003 if its production volume remains at the current level.  9   Staff Report August 7, 2000 BMW and Volkswagen have each been selling approximately 35,000 vehicles per year in California in recent years. If their 2000 through 2002 MY average sales exceed 35,000, they will need to meet ZEV requirements as large volume manufacturers beginning in MY 2006. Subaru, which is currently considered an intermediate volume manufacturer, has been selling near the lower limit of the intermediate volume manufacturer classification in California in recent years. Therefore, depending on its actual sales in model years 2000 through 2002, Subaru may be classified as either an intermediate or a small volume manufacturer in MY 2003. In 1998 Isuzu produced only light duty trucks between 3,751 and 5,750 pounds gross vehicle weight (LDT2s), which are not subject to the ZEV requirement. Rover produced only medium duty vehicles, also not subject to the ZEV requirement. Therefore, although Isuzu and Rover are intermediate volume manufacturers, they will not need to produce any ZEVs in MY 2003 if they continue to produce only LDT2 and medium duty vehicles. 2.4 Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements  In recent years there have been many new multi-manufacturer arrangements, which have made it difficult to delineate individual companies. For example:       Ford fully owns Volvo and Jaguar, and partially owns Mazda General Motors fully owns Saab, and partially owns Suzuki and Subaru DaimlerChrysler partially owns Mitsubishi and Hyundai Nissan is fully owned by Renault Volkswagen fully owns Rolls Royce Kia is partially owned by Hyundai, Ford, and Mazda  Thus the question arises--against what base should the ""10 percent of sales"" ZEV obligation be assessed? Currently, manufacturer sales numbers are not aggregated if the manufacturers are ""operationally independent"". Because the meaning of this term is not always readily apparent given the variety of ownership situations, ARB staff held a workshop on March 30, 2000 to clarify the ZEV-related emission compliance liabilities of companies in multi-manufacturer arrangements. Manufacturers have reviewed the implications of using the CAP2000 aggregation provisions for this purpose. (The CAP2000 regulations govern how sales from small manufacturers partially owned by other firms are aggregated for purposes of regulatory compliance). In general, the CAP2000 provisions are believed by manufacturers to be too restrictive. Manufacturers have recommended alternative procedures, but no consensus exists. Staff will work to finalize a proposal such that majority interest in a company triggers liability for ZEV obligations. The resulting policy will be implemented either by regulatory amendments or through issuance of a  10   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Manufacturer's Advisory Correspondence. Appropriate lead time will be provided before any changes become effective. 2.5 ZEV Production to Date by Large Manufacturers  The ZEVs that have been placed in California by large manufacturers as of March 31, 2000 are described in the following table. Manufacturer Model Daimler Chrysler Ford GM EPIC EPIC Ranger Ranger EV1 EV1 EV1 S-10 S-10 EV Plus Altra RAV4 Battery Type PbA NiMH PbA NiMH PbA (Delco) PbA (Panasonic) NiMH PbA NiMH NiMH LiIon NiMH Lease City Highway Number a b Cost ($) Range Rangeb Placed NA 70 65 17 450 varied varied 349 424 499 439 440 455 599 457 92 84 94 75 111 143 46 92 125 120 142 97 69 86 78 113 152 43 99 105 107 116 185 52 356 400 0 162 110 117 276 81 486  Honda Nissan Toyota a. b.  Lease prices shown include governmental incentives. Unless otherwise noted, all range figures used in this document are based on the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and the highway fuel economy driving schedule (HFEDS) test cycles. Real world driving range will be less.  Overall, manufacturers have adopted similar strategies to make these vehicles attractive to customers. The vehicles typically are available via a three-year lease without a down payment. This reduces the risk to the customer that their vehicle will be obsolete in a few years due to technical advances. Similarly, the warranty provided on the vehicles is comprehensive, and covers all components. This eliminates any durability issues or concerns on the part of the customer. Several manufacturers also include a charger in the lease. Finally, the lease typically includes roadside assistance services. Because production levels for these vehicles are not yet sufficient to justify assembly line tooling and manufacturing techniques, in many (but not all) cases the vehicles have been produced in a ""batch"" process. Under this method, a small quantity of vehicles is built at one time. A new batch is produced when necessary.  11   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Some details regarding the specific activities of each manufacturer are provided in the EV Market section below. 2.6 ZEV Volume Estimates for 2003  California sales of passenger cars plus light duty trucks by the large automobile manufacturers total approximately one million vehicles per year. As a rule of thumb, therefore, each one percent of vehicle sales equals about ten thousand vehicles per year. The calculation of the actual number of vehicles needed to meet the ZEV requirement in any given year is considerably more complex, however, due to several factors:  Manufacturers can earn ""multipliers"" for vehicles with extended range, with additional allowances for vehicles delivered prior to 2003. Taken together these two factors can result in up to 10 allowances per vehicle for vehicles delivered in MY 1999 and 2000. Specifically, each ZEV and full ZEV allowance vehicle that is produced and delivered for sale in California in the 1999 to 2007 model years, and that has an extended electric range, qualifies for a ZEV multiplier as shown below. These multipliers are based on range alone and are not dependent on the type of battery or the battery specific energy. MY 1999-2000 MY 2001 -2002 MY 2003-2005 MY 2006-2007 6-10 4-6 2-4 1-2  All-electric range 100-175 miles      In addition to the multipliers discussed above, ZEV credits ""banked"" in a prior year have greater value when ""cashed"" in a subsequent year, based on the relative values for the NMOG fleet average for the years in question. Under this provision, for example, ZEV credits earned in 1999 are multiplied by 1.82 if used in 2003, and credits earned in 2000, 2001 and 2002 are multiplied by 1.18, 1.13, and 1.1 respectively. Taking into account all available multipliers, a single 175 mile range vehicle placed in 1999 would earn 18.2 allowances. Manufacturers are given one additional model year to make up any shortfall in ZEV production. Thus, a manufacturer could choose to satisfy both its 2003 and 2004 obligation with vehicles delivered in 2004. In order to meet their obligation, large manufacturers must offer for sale a minimum of 4 percent pure ZEVs. They may, however, choose to meet the entire 10 percent requirement using pure ZEVs.  To provide a context for the Board's evaluation of the ZEV program, staff have developed a ""base case"" estimate of the number of ZEVs that the large manufacturers must produce in 2003 in order to satisfy the 4 percent ZEV  12   Staff Report August 7, 2000 requirement. Due to trade secret considerations this estimate does not rely on any confidential information provided in the manufacturer product plans. Instead, it is calculated using publicly available information, with the following assumptions:  The vehicles offered for sale in 2003 are identical in performance to the vehicles currently or most recently offered by the manufacturers. (The specific vehicles, their test cycle range, and the resulting number of allowances earned per vehicle are shown below.) Manufacturers do not take advantage of the multipliers available for early introduction; the entire 2003 obligation is met with vehicles produced in 2003. Each manufacturer's production volume in 2003 is equal to its production volume in 1998. Manufacturers meet 60 percent of their ZEV obligation using partial ZEV allowances, and 40 percent of their obligation (4 percent of sales) using pure ZEVs. (An estimate assuming that manufacturers meet their entire 10 percent obligation with pure ZEVs, using no partial ZEV allowances, is shown for comparison purposes.)      With these assumptions, 2003 pure ZEV production would be as follows: Manufacturer GMb 1998 ZEV model Production (PC+LDT1) 84,106 1999 NiMH EV1 84,106 1999 PbA EV1 42,053 1999 NiMH S10 201,473 1998 RAV4 EV 186,977 1999 NiMH Ranger 172,768 EV Plus 88,455 2000 Altra 105,691 1999 NiMH EPIC Urban Rangea (miles) 143 111 92 143 71 125 129 92 Multiplier per vehicle 3.144 2.293 1.000 3.141 1.000 2.672 2.773 1.000 2003 ZEV Obligation 4% 10% 1,070 2,675 1,467 3,667 1,682 4,205 2,565 6,414 7,479 18,698 2,586 6,466 1,276 3,189 4,228 10,569  TOYOTA FORD HONDA NISSAN DAIMLER CHRYSLER TOTAL a. b.  965,630 Test cycle range. Real world driving range will be less.  22,353 55,884  This estimate assumes that GM sales are 40 percent NiMH EV1, 40 percent Panasonic PbA EV1, and 20 percent NiMH S10.  This estimate, at roughly 22,000 vehicles, corresponds to about 2.3 percent of the passenger car and light duty truck production of the affected manufacturers. It must be noted, however, that actual 2003 ZEV production may vary significantly from this number due to the various factors discussed above. For  13   Staff Report August 7, 2000 example, several manufacturers have testified that due to lead time considerations they will not be able to take full advantage of the PZEV option in 2003. Thus they will need to place more than 4 percent ZEVs in the early years. On the other hand, the manufacturers' obligations for 2003 can be significantly reduced if they take advantage of the multiple credits available for early introduction. For example, the table below shows the number of vehicles needed by Honda and Toyota to meet the 4 percent requirement in 2003, with and without early introduction of vehicles. Additional credits will be needed to meet the obligation for 2004 and later years. Scenario Honda, without early introduction Honda, with early introduction Difference Toyota, without early introduction Toyota, with early introduction Difference 2001 0 500 500 0 500 500 2002 0 500 500 0 500 500 2003 2586 641 -1945 2565 742 -1823 Total (3 years) 2586 1641 -945 2565 1742 -823  Looking at the cumulative effect of the program over time, the regulation requires placements in 2004 and 2005 equivalent to those in 2003, and a greater number in 2006 and beyond as multiple credits begin to be phased out. Again using our base case assumptions, the required number of vehicles in 2006 is about 31,000 for a 4 percent requirement, and about 78,000 to meet 10 percent. Thus over the 4 year period from 2003 through 2006, the base case estimate of the total number of vehicles ranges between about 100,000 (4 percent) and 250,000 (10 percent). Manufacturers are required, under the Memoranda of Agreement with the ARB, to submit confidential product plans outlining the product mix that they will use to meet the 2003 requirement (see Section 3.2.3 below). All manufacturers submitted these plans on a timely basis. All manufacturers demonstrated that they have the technical capability to produce the quantity of vehicles needed to meet their 2003 obligation. The manufacturers uniformly argue, however, that the cost of these vehicles remains high, and foreseeable battery technology will result in limitations on vehicle range. Thus in their view it will be very difficult to develop a self-sustaining mass market for battery electric vehicles at this time. Staff notes that technical advances are steadily reducing the cost premium associated with ZEVs and that increased production volume will bring about further reductions. Battery cost will, however, remain high for the foreseeable future.  14   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3 3.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT Introduction  In 1996, the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board and all seven large auto manufacturers signed Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs). The large auto manufacturers who signed the MOAs are General Motors, Ford, Chrysler (now DaimlerChrysler), Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Mazda. The MOAs are intended to help ensure progress towards a successful launch of a sustainable market for zero emission vehicles in California, by using market based strategies for introduction of zero emission vehicles. They include binding commitments from each of the seven auto manufacturers as well as from ARB. Under the MOAs, the auto manufacturers committed to:   Offset the emission benefits lost due to the elimination of the ZEV requirement for 1998 through 2002; Establish and maintain the capacity to produce a specific number of ZEVs based on manufacturer estimates of customer demand. Each manufacturer confidentially submitted this information to ARB. Several manufacturers judged the market to be zero, based on available product, planned battery use and anticipated costs. Submit annual progress reports, and biennial product plans outlining how they will comply with the 2003 requirement; Participate in a technology development partnership, including continued investment in ZEV and battery research and development, and placement of advanced battery-powered ZEVs in marketplace demonstration programs; Collaborate with the ARB and the State Fire Marshal on ZEV safety training; and Provide the ARB with an on-site review of manufacturer activities and hardware related to the ZEV program.       The ARB, meanwhile, committed in the MOAs to working with state and local governments and others to help develop ZEV infrastructure and remove barriers to ZEV introduction. Specifically, the ARB must:         Facilitate the purchase of ZEVs in state fleets; Address insurance and financing issues; Work with other state agencies to ensure the availability of battery recycling; Work with local governments on planning and permitting of charging stations; Work with utilities and electrical contractor trade groups to ensure adequate training for installation and maintenance of EV charging systems; Support the efforts of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Working Council; Work with the State Fire Marshal and other emergency response officials to create a comprehensive ZEV emergency response training program; Observe the activities of the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium; and  15   Staff Report August 7, 2000  3.2 Support the development and implementation of reasonable incentive programs that enhance the near-term marketability of ZEVs. Manufacturer Commitments  All of the large auto manufacturers submitted the annual reports and the product plans as required. These reports outline the progress made towards meeting the requirements of the MOAs. The following information is based on the manufacturers' submittals as well as private meetings and phone conversations with manufacturers. Staff concludes that the manufacturers and the ARB have met the commitments made in the MOAs. The remainder of this chapter provides detail on the individual tasks. 3.2.1 Cleaner Cars Nationwide (National Low-Emission Vehicle Program) The MOAs require the auto manufacturers to introduce low-emission vehicles nationwide in 2001, three years earlier than could be required under federal law. The National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEV) program was included in the MOAs to offset the emission increases associated with the 1996 revisions to the ZEV program, and thereby maintain the integrity of ARB's State Implementation Plan. Because non-California vehicles frequently travel through California or relocate to California from other states, cleaning up non-California vehicles results in emission reductions within California's borders. A 1996 ARB staff analysis indicates that the NLEV program will full meet the 2010 emission goals of the MOA. In March 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that 23 automobile manufacturers--including the seven manufacturers that signed the MOA--and nine northeastern states have agreed to the new voluntary NLEV program. Starting in 1999, light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks sold in the northeast are meeting more stringent emission requirements. The program will be expanded nationally in 2001. This agreement between the EPA and the auto manufacturers will fulfill the MOA obligation. 3.2.2 Market-Based ZEV Launch The MOAs express the auto manufacturers' commitment to have the capacity to produce a certain number of ZEVs ""that could be sold in California if warranted by customer demand"" (Section I.B.). These vehicles are in addition to the demonstration vehicles discussed under Section 3.2.4.2 below. The specific number was separately and confidentially determined by each manufacturer. The purpose of this element of the MOA was to ensure that manufacturers have the production capacity to meet their estimate of market demand for ZEVs during the ramp-up period prior to 2003. Attached to each MOA as Exhibit A was the manufacturer's confidential November 1995 submittal identifying the manufacturer's annual capacity to produce ZEVs for the 1996 through 2002 16   Staff Report August 7, 2000 model years, in accordance with their estimate of market readiness. Several manufacturers judged the market to be zero, based on available product, planned battery use and anticipated costs. The timing of vehicle introduction by the various manufacturers has varied, based upon the type of vehicle, the battery employed, specific technical challenges that needed to be overcome, and near-term targeted markets. As of January 2000, Ford, General Motors, Honda and Toyota have placed a total of 738 vehicles above and beyond those required under the MOA demonstration program. The RAV 4, Altra and EPIC vehicles are currently only marketed to fleets, and production quantities are limited. Honda has announced that it will not produce additional vehicles, and will focus its efforts on evaluating customer satisfaction and providing customer support for vehicles currently in service. The net result of these manufacturer actions is that fleet customers face limited product availability, and the only vehicle marketed to retail customers, the EV1, is sold out. There is no four passenger, family vehicle currently available to the public. Some parties have argued that the limited availability of vehicles constitutes evidence that manufacturers are not complying with their MOA commitment. As defined in the MOA, ""Capacity to produce"" means that the manufacturer has available adequate vehicle production facilities either in-house or contractually with others, including the in-house ability or outside contracts sufficient to supply major vehicle parts and component needs. ""Capacity to produce"" does not obligate the manufacturer to produce, deliver or sell a specified number of ZEVs. (Definitions, Section X.D.). A lack of available product therefore does not in and of itself signify noncompliance with the MOA. An evaluation of compliance with the market-based ZEV launch requirement of the MOAs also requires an interpretation of the phrase ""if warranted by customer demand"". In the view of staff, a reasonable interpretation of customer demand implies demand that exists when the vehicle is priced at or near the manufacturer's cost. The current lease rates for the vehicles do not recover the relatively high cost of producing an EV today. Although it is common for manufacturers to sell some vehicles at a loss for larger corporate strategy purposes, the current differential between the lease prices for battery electric vehicles and the manufacturers' cost is substantial. Manufacturers have used various methods to determine the lease prices used for today's vehicles, but in no case have the vehicles been priced at a level that is close to the manufacturers' cost. Although we do not know what demand would exist if the vehicles were priced to recover at least the majority of their cost, presumably it would be less than that seen over the past several years. In sum, staff concludes that manufacturers are in compliance with their commitment to have the capacity to produce vehicles that could be sold in California if warranted by customer demand. As is discussed in the EV Market chapter below, however, the production gap between now and 2003 is interfering with the necessary continuity in ZEV market penetration.  17   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3.2.3 Zero Emission Vehicle Product Plans Under the MOAs, the manufacturers are required to submit ZEV product plans prior to November 1 of the year preceding the scheduled review (in this instance, prior to November 1, 1999). Each manufacturer must submit corporate product plans that demonstrate compliance with the ZEV requirement for 2003. All of the manufacturers submitted the required plans on a timely basis. The product plans identify the manufacturers' strategies for 2003, including key decision points and other milestones. ARB staff have carefully reviewed the product plan submittals. Staff also made site visits to Japan and Michigan to tour the manufacturers' research and development facilities, and receive briefings on their research efforts. Based upon the review and site visits, staff is confident that the product plans accurately represent the status of work at the manufacturers. The information in these confidential product plans provides part of the basis for the staff assessment of the current status of ZEV technology, discussed elsewhere in this document. 3.2.4 Technology Development Partnership Under the Technology Development Partnership component of the MOA, the auto manufacturers agreed to make good faith efforts to promote and develop a market for ZEVs and to ensure ongoing ZEV-related research and development. To accomplish this effort, each manufacturer committed to continue battery research and development throughout the term of the MOA, and to place new ZEVs with advanced technology batteries into service in California through the advanced technology battery demonstration project. 3.2.4.1 Research and Development  All of the large manufacturers have extensive internal research and development efforts underway. The briefings and staff site visits in Michigan and Japan conclusively demonstrated that all manufacturers are actively pursuing a full range of zero and near-zero emission vehicle technologies. The extensive staffing levels and other resource commitments dedicated to advanced technology give evidence of the manufacturers' conviction that in the future, customers will be favorable towards products that offer ongoing environmental improvement. Staff was impressed with the intense work underway in a variety of program areas, and the commitment by all manufacturers to play a leadership role in the commercialization of zero and near-zero emission vehicles. In addition to in-house efforts, under the terms of the MOA General Motors committed to contribute $8.9 million during Phase II of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), while DaimlerChrysler and Ford have  18   Staff Report August 7, 2000 committed $3.34 and $6.67 million respectively. All three manufacturers are on target with their contributions and will completely contribute the full amounts by 2002. 3.2.4.2 Advanced Technology Battery Demonstration Project  The auto manufacturers each also agreed to produce their pro-rata share of up to 3,750 advanced battery vehicles between 1998 and 2000, and place them in demonstration programs designed to validate the new technology. Table 3-1 below shows each manufacturer's share of the total ZEVs to be placed in demonstration programs. To receive MOA ZEV credit towards the commitments enumerated in Table 3-1, a ZEV must use advanced batteries. For the purposes of the MOAs, ""advanced battery"" means a battery with a specific energy of at least 40 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) for the 1998 calendar year and at least 50 Wh/kg for 1999 and subsequent calendar years. (Specific energy is the amount of energy per unit of weight and is related directly to range). Table 3-1 Auto Manufacturer MOA Advanced Battery Demonstration Commitments Number of Vehicles (Based on Average Market Share) Calendar Year 1998 1999 2000 Total Chrysler Ford General Motors 182 365 366 Honda Mazdaa Nissan Toyota Total by Year 748 1,500 1,502 3,750  51 103 103  181 363 363  101 202 203  28 55 55  70 141 141  135 271 271  a. Mazda's MOA obligation has been met by Ford. The amount of credit given in the MOA for an advanced battery-powered ZEV is based on the specific energy of the batteries. Manufacturers may reduce the total number of ZEVs required if the batteries used in the vehicles have a specific energy greater than 50 Wh/kg. Table 3-2 on the next page indicates the number of credits that are granted for ZEVs that use advanced batteries.  19   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Table 3-2 MOA ZEV Credits Allowed for an Advanced Battery-Powered ZEV Specific Energy 40 Wh/kg (1998 only) 50 Wh/kg (1999 and 2000) 60 Wh/kg 90 Wh/kg Number of ZEV credits allowed One Two Three  The advanced battery-powered vehicles that are being produced today have specific energy ratings of between 55 and 85 Wh/kg depending on the battery technology used. It is expected that advanced battery-powered EVs to be marketed in 2003 will fall approximately within this range as well. Linear interpolation is used to determine the number of MOA credits earned by ZEVs with specific energy over 50 Wh/kg. Therefore, ZEVs placed as part of the Technology Development Partnership are generating from 1.5 to 2.8 MOA ZEV credits per vehicle. As a result, the actual number of vehicles to be produced to meet the auto manufacturers' advanced battery vehicle MOA commitments will be approximately 1,800 rather than 3,750. In early 1999, both Honda and Toyota completed placement of advanced batterypowered electric vehicles for the Technology Development Partnership. General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Mazda are on track to complete their commitments by the end of 2000. Nissan requested and received approval to delay placement of a small portion of their vehicles for one year (until 2001) due to a battery supplier issue. As of January 2000 there were already more than 1,300 advanced battery electric vehicles placed in California as a result of this project. At the conclusion of the project, there will be more than 1,800 electric vehicles operating on advanced technology batteries on the roads of California. 3.2.5 Annual Reports The MOAs require manufacturers to file an annual report within 90 days after the close of each calendar year. The annual reports must provide information regarding ZEVs placed in California and elsewhere in the United States during the previous calendar year. The annual report must also contain information regarding the placement of ZEVs under the Technology Development Partnership. All manufacturers have submitted their annual reports as required.  20   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3.2.6 Collaboration with ARB and State Fire Marshal The MOAs require manufacturers to collaborate with the ARB and the State Fire Marshal to develop the curriculum and materials necessary for a comprehensive ZEV safety-training program. This training program, which was completed in 1998, is described in more detail under the description of ARB's related commitment in Section 3.3.8 below. 3.2.7 On-Site Review The MOAs require the manufacturer to provide ARB staff with an on-site review of activities and hardware related to the manufacturer's ZEV program. ARB staff visited Honda, Nissan and Toyota facilities in Japan in December 1999, and visited General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler facilities in Michigan in February 2000. During these visits ARB staff received extensive briefings on the manufacturers' activities, and had the opportunity to view and/or test-drive a variety of vehicles. As a result of these visits and the information that has been provided, ARB staff have a thorough understanding of the status of work at each manufacturer. 3.3 Air Resources Board Commitments  As its part of the MOA, ARB committed to a number of tasks aimed at making California ready for the ZEV market. The following sections summarize the activities that the ARB has undertaken or supported to meet the commitments made in the MOA. 3.3.1 Purchase/Lease of EVs by State and Local Governments The MOAs specify that ARB must facilitate the purchase of ZEVs for appropriate applications in state fleets. ARB must work with the California Department of General Services and the California Energy Commission to establish vehicle specifications for the State Bid List, and work with the Department of General Services Office of Fleet Administration to ensure the sale or lease of ZEVs to selected state agencies. The Department of General Services has executed Master Service Agreements with the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (for the EV1 and the Chevrolet S-10), American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (for the EV PLUS), Toyota Motor Company (for the RAV4), and Ford Motor Credit (for the Ford Ranger). These Master Service Agreements allow all state agencies, as well as the University of California, California State University, the Community Colleges, and local governments, to lease ZEVs according to pre-defined and pre-approved terms, conditions and lease rates. This greatly simplifies the leasing process and allows for more rapid acquisition of vehicles. Additional Master Service Agreement with DaimlerChrysler Corporation (for the EPIC) and Nissan (for the Altra EV) are currently being developed.  21   Staff Report August 7, 2000 As of May 2000, 28 different state and local agencies have leased or committed to lease more than 100 vehicles under these Master Service Agreements and prior agreements. These numbers are expanding rapidly due to the ev Sacramento program, discussed in Section 3.3.1.2 below. Leases or commitments have been made by the following:                            Department of General Services Department of Water Resources Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Department of Justice Department of Parks and Recreation Department of Food and Agriculture Department of Toxic Substances Control Department of Social Services Cal/EPA Air Resources Board Integrated Waste Management Board California Energy Commission California Highway Patrol CalTrans Bureau of Automotive Repair Office of State Printing Franchise Tax Board California Exposition and State Fair University of California, Davis University of California, Los Angeles California State University, Chico Sacramento County City of Sacramento City of Citrus Heights Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District Sacramento Metropolitan Airport Sacramento Public Library  These totals do not include a large number of local agencies that have leased ZEVs using mechanisms other than the state Master Service Agreement. The ARB and other state and local agencies have undertaken other activities to further encourage ZEV leasing, such as the following: 3.3.1.1 The EV Loan Program  To encourage the use of EVs in public fleets and address its obligation under the MOAs, the ARB designed a three-year program to loan EVs at no cost to federal, state and local government agencies. The South Coast Air Quality Management  22   Staff Report August 7, 2000 District provides financial support for the operation of the program within its jurisdiction. The Department of General Services (DGS) assists with housing, maintaining and dispatching the loan program EV fleet. The goals of the EV Loan Program are to encourage EV leasing by providing public agencies with a no-risk opportunity to see if electric vehicles meet agency needs, familiarize senior officials with vehicle capabilities, and publicize the availability of electric vehicles to governmental agencies and to the public at large. The loan fleet includes fifteen vehicles--four GM EV1 vehicles with lead acid batteries (currently returned to GM due to the recall), six Honda EV Plus vehicles with nickel metal hydride batteries, and five Ford Ranger pickups with nickel metal hydride batteries. Six additional vehicles (two Chevrolet S10 pickups and four Toyota RAV4 vehicles, all with nickel metal hydride batteries) have been ordered to expand the program. The EV Loan Program began operation on a pilot basis in Sacramento in March 1998, using one Honda EV Plus that was provided by the DGS. The loan program's own vehicles were delivered in June 1998 (EV Plus), August 1998 (EV1), and January 1999 (Ford Ranger). The program expanded to Los Angeles in September 1998, the Bay Area in October 1998, and San Diego in April 1999. As of June 2000 , there have been more than 131 loans completed. Loan durations ranged from several days to three months, but the majority were one month. Fifteen loans are in progress, and thirteen additional agencies are waiting to participate. Although forty-three vehicles have been leased as a result of the program, this number would be higher if additional vehicles were available. The EV Loan Program is a large-scale effort to provide public agencies with the opportunity to drive EVs. The program has demonstrated that public agencies, when given real-world experience with EVs, often find that the vehicles provide an environmentally sound way to meet many of their fleet needs. The agencies have been able to develop a good understanding of EV range, reliability, operating and maintenance costs, infrastructure requirements, and other data needed to make informed leasing decisions, both now and in the future. In response to this program and to show support for EVs, many government agencies and utilities have adopted resolutions that require that EVs be purchased or leased for their fleet. These agencies have the necessary funding available but cannot get the vehicles. Thus the goal of this program-to encourage EV leases--is frustrated when there are no vehicles available. This program has also provided ARB staff with extensive experience with EVs on longer trips in real world conditions. In order to supply EVs to as many agencies as possible, ARB staff have delivered these vehicles to agencies in areas such 23   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Santa Cruz, Bodega Bay, Sonoma County, Channel Islands National Park, Ventura County, San Jacinto, Lake Perris and Palm Springs. Although additional planning and time is needed to deliver the vehicles to these areas, staff have always been successful and have learned a lot about the functionality of EVs in real world conditions. 3.3.1.2 Department of General Services Outreach  The Department of General Services, Office of Fleet Administration, has an aggressive program in place to encourage state agencies to lease electric vehicles. In addition to its support for the EV loan program described above, the Department:        Provides free daily use of EVs through the state vehicle pool fleet Provides ride and drive opportunities to state executives Provides flexible lease terms with no-penalty cancellation provisions Sends letters to state fleet managers and Business Services Officers outlining EV availability Showcases EVs at numerous conferences and other events Participates in the national Clean Cities program Maintains a web site providing information on EV options ev Sacramento  3.3.1.3  Many California public agencies are already using electric vehicles. EVs are being driven by agency administrators, field and technical staff, and have been incorporated into a variety of public programs. One barrier that has hindered public agencies in acquiring electric vehicles, however, has been their higher initial cost when compared to their conventionally fueled counterparts. ARB is committed to increasing the use of EVs by State agencies, and initiated ev Sacramento to assist with this commitment. The goal of ev Sacramento is to assist State and local public agencies in the Sacramento region to lease EVs at competitive prices. By offsetting the initial higher costs of these vehicles, this program will significantly expand the use of EVs in the Sacramento area. The program is jointly administered by the ARB and the Department of General Services Office of Fleet Administration. ev Sacramento is a three-year program, and includes most of the EVs that are now commercially available. The vehicles that are available through the program include the GM EV1, Toyota RAV4 EV, Ford Ranger, , and the Honda EV Plus. Program staff is also working with Nissan to include the Altra in the program. Vehicle rollout began in May 2000. State and local agencies in the Sacramento area are eligible to participate. Participants pay reduced lease payments that are comparable to lease rates for conventional vehicles. In addition, ev Sacramento staff coordinate the delivery of the vehicles and the installation of charging infrastructure, and provide all training and user support. 24   Staff Report August 7, 2000 As of June 2000, 21 state and local agencies have committed to lease 76 vehicles. evSacramento is currently fully subscribed, and there is a waiting list of public agencies that would like to lease vehicles if they become available. Originally 120 vehicles were to be included in the program; however due to limited vehicle availability staff has only been able to lease 76 vehicles to date. Although placements to date are less than the target of 120 vehicles, this is solely due to the lack of vehicle availability. The current mix of vehicles in the program is 34 RAV4 EVs, 30 Ford Rangers, 2 EV1s, and 10 Honda EV Pluses. Staff is currently working with Nissan to include ten Altras into the program. 3.3.1.4 State Budget  Each year, the state Budget Act appropriates funds from the Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA) to support a variety of energy and transportation projects. Portions of this funding have been used to subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles and infrastructure by local agencies. The 2000-2001 Governor's Budget includes significant funding from the Petroleum Violation Escrow Account and the General Fund for electric and alternative fuel vehicles, incentives and infrastructure. Highlights include:       $5 million for the Air Resources Board to participate in the Fuel Cell Partnership $6 million for the California Energy Commission to establish a clean fuels infrastructure for public agencies $5 million for the California Energy Commission to establish the Vehicle Efficiency Incentive program to provide incentives for the lease or purchase of electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicles $1 million for the California Energy Commission to develop a hydrogen fuel infrastructure as part of the Fuel Cell Partnership $0.5 million for the California Energy Commission to study issues affecting hydrogen fueling infrastructure $4 million for the Department of General Services to purchase alternative fuel vehicles for the state vehicle fleet  3.3.2 Insurance The ARB is required to work with the California Department of Insurance to establish reasonable rates for insuring new ZEVs, to promote insurance industry awareness of ZEVs, and to resolve other issues related to insuring ZEVs. ARB staff and Department of Insurance staff are not aware of any insurance issues that have arisen with the market-based launch of EVs over three years ago. The EV user has had little difficulty obtaining necessary insurance. At least one manufacturer, Honda, includes comprehensive and collision insurance in the lease package. For drivers of other EV models, the insurance experience  25   Staff Report August 7, 2000 appears to have been smooth, with comparable coverage and rates available including second car discounts. On occasion, the EV user may need to spend additional time in the process if the insurer has not had experience writing a policy for an EV. Based on an informal ARB staff survey of retail EV users in California, it appears that insurance for EVs is available from virtually every insurance company licensed to do business in California. Staff also met with a local insurance broker, who represents a larger company, to discuss the process for establishing the insurance rate for an EV. The broker indicated that the process is identical to that used for any vehicle on the market. With the make and model in hand, the broker looks up a vehicle's ""insurance rating group"" (IRG). Vehicles with similar characteristics, (e.g., replacement and repair costs, typical damage, and model year) may be placed in the same IRG. If a vehicle has not been assigned to an IRG, or is a new model or model year not covered by an IRG, the industry standard practice is to calculate a rate based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). The broker visited by staff had an IRG manual that contained specific instructions for EV rates to be calculated using the MSRP. As no significant insurance issues have arisen with the market-based launch, ARB staff concludes that insurance issues will not present obstacles to further expansion of the EV market. Staff will, however, continue to monitor insurance availability for EVs as the market grows. 3.3.3 Financing The ARB is required to work with the California Department of State Banking to develop risk assessment data to assist in securing financing for the purchase or lease of ZEVs. To date, financing issues have not presented obstacles to further expansion of the EV market. Financing has not presented a problem for retail consumers because to date the vehicles are primarily leased rather than purchased. The decision to lease EVs to consumers rather than sell the vehicles has not been based on concerns about financing availability. Rather, the auto manufacturers have indicated that offering lease programs to consumers protects customers from risks associated with investing in new, quickly changing technology. ARB staff will continue to monitor these areas to ensure that any future issues that arise are dealt with in a timely manner. 3.3.4 Battery Recycling The MOA directed the ARB to work with the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Integrated Waste Management Board, and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to ensure the availability of sufficient battery recycling capacity.  26   Staff Report August 7, 2000 To address issues related to EV battery disposal and recycling, the ARB contracted with ARCADIS Geraghty & Miller in 1994. This contract work was broken into two main tasks. First, the contractor evaluated battery technologies based on their performance and recyclability. This work was completed in March of 1995. In addition to determining where efforts should be focused in establishing new recycling facilities and developing cleaner technologies, task one recommended that a deposit of between $100 to $150 be levied on light-duty vehicle batteries to ensure they are returned for recycling. Task two compared the relative health and hazard impacts from EV battery recycling technology, and was completed in April of 1999. The main focus of task two was to compare the relative impact of recycling EV batteries in terms of cancer, toxicity, and ecotoxicological potential, as well as leachability, flammability, and corrosivity hazards. These impacts were evaluated for recycling methods, including smelting, electrowinnowing, and other appropriate techniques that apply to different battery technologies. A multi-attribute impact analysis was performed on the health and hazard effects resulting from the recycling and disposal of each battery type. The methodology used a semiqualitative ranking to weight the relative impact and establish a health and environmental impact score for each battery type. Due to the substantial uncertainties surrounding the analyses, the methodology is designed for comparison purposes only. While current battery constituents are fairly well known, they do vary with manufacturer and are likely to change in the future. In addition, there are substantial uncertainties surrounding the health impact values and future recycling technologies. With this said, a broad conclusion of the analysis is that the more advanced batteries represent a great improvement over conventional lead-acid batteries, both in terms of battery performance and impacts from recycling spent batteries. In addition to this contract work, ARB staff has also followed battery recycling issues at the national level by participating on the Department of Energy's Advanced Battery Readiness Working Committee. One of the Committee's main activities is to address issues related to EV battery disposal and to review progress made in developing new recycling methods for advanced batteries. At this time, there do not appear to be any overwhelming obstacles to recycling the battery technologies expected in the 2003 timeframe. Currently, there is one facility in the United States capable of recycling nickel-based batteries. Another plant in Canada is now successfully recycling large military lithium-based batteries. While recycling technologies are being developed and are expected to be in place, it will be necessary to build new recycling plants for certain battery types, such as lithium-ion, to accommodate their use in large quantities. Any new recycling facilities would be required to meet stringent air quality and environmental regulations that would minimize any adverse effects of the recycling processes.  27   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3.3.5 Assist Local Governments with Public Infrastructure The MOA requires the ARB to work with automakers, the California Energy Commission, and local governments to provide assistance in planning and permitting quick charge and public charging stations. ARB has worked with utilities and electric vehicle infrastructure providers to assess charging station implementation issues and ensure that public charging facilities are developed as needed. This group instigated and coordinated the development of training for building officials involved with permitting and inspection of infrastructure installations. Specifically, following adoption of the California code revisions described under Section 3.3.6 below, a training program was developed for building officials that covered the following:      The new Building Code and Electric Code provisions governing EVs; Plan check and inspection techniques for the new regulation; An overview of current and emerging EV technologies including automotive, batteries and charging equipment; An opportunity to see and drive current production vehicles; and Hands-on experience with charging system equipment.  The current status of public infrastructure is discussed in more detail in Section 6.2 below. 3.3.6 Training for Installation and Maintenance of EV Charging Stations The MOAs directed ARB to work with utilities and trade groups representing electrical contractors to provide training for installation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging systems. To address issues associated with installation of EV chargers, especially related to building codes, electrical codes and training of permitting and inspection personnel, the California Energy Commission formed the Building Codes Working Group. The Building Codes Working Group included the Energy Commission, the ARB, the California Building Officials, the California Electric Transportation Coalition, California utilities, General Motors, and Hughes Power Systems. The Building Codes Working Group developed revisions to the California Building Standards to allow for safe installation of electric vehicle charging systems. The Building Code changes, effective in 1996, defined EV charging equipment, added safety requirements, clarified the definition of refueling, and added ventilation requirements. The Building Codes Working Group also modified the California Electric Code to include a requirement to use approved or UL listed EV charging equipment. In an effort to provide a national standard for building code requirements related to EV charging systems, the Building Code Working Group focused much of its efforts through 1997 on preparing modifications to the National Electric Code. Changes suggested by the Building Code Working Group were forwarded to the  28   Staff Report August 7, 2000 National Infrastructure Working Council for approval and submittal to the National Electric Code governing organization. Additional activities of the Building Code Working Group included development of Interim Disabled Access Guidelines for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in cooperation with the State Architect. Since EV charging stations are offered as a service to the general public, they are required to be accessible to those with disabilities. The guidelines give potential public infrastructure providers guidance on making installations accessible to those with disabilities. The final project undertaken by the Building Code Working Group was the development of an informational brochure for building officials, contractors and consumers. The brochure provides information about permitting and inspection requirements, cites appropriate building and electric codes and gives phone numbers for agencies that can provide further information. Between 1996 and 1997, California electric utilities and infrastructure providers met monthly to establish and coordinate the multiple steps of the charger installation process. Southern California Edison has written and distributed installation guidelines for private electrical contractors and utility personnel. electric utilities have trained their own customer service and operations personnel on EV installations, established 800 numbers for EV-related inquiries, and created special EV rates. Utilities and infrastructure providers continue to provide training for individual jurisdictions on an as-needed basis. Extensive training for EV charger installations is also conducted by equipment manufacturers and installation service providers. There are now at least two dozen licensed electrical contractors who are certified to do installations. When larger numbers of vehicles become available there will be a need to expand the network of trained installers, but the procedures for ensuring safe code-compliant installations are already in place and residential installations have generally been proceeding smoothly. 3.3.7 Support Efforts of National Infrastructure Working Council The National Infrastructure Working Council was initiated by EPRI, at the request of its member utilities, to work on a variety of infrastructure issues including standardization of power supply, emergency disconnect, and standard conductive and inductive charging systems. California's electric utilities have played an active role in the Council. Under the MOAs, ARB is required to support the Infrastructure Working Council's efforts. ARB staff has attended the Infrastructure Working Council's meetings, observing and participating in the Health and Safety Committee, the Connector and Connecting Stations Committee and the Connector Standardization Subcommittee of the Bus and Non-Road Committee. ARB's participation in the Health and Safety Committee has been focused on assistance with the proposed modification of the National Electric Code. ARB and California Energy  29   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Commission staff have observed and provided comments to the Connector and Connecting Stations Committee. This Committee, in turn, provided input to the Society of Automotive Engineers, which adopted a single standard for the butttype conductive connector used by Honda and Ford. ARB staff has also observed the early work of the Bus and Non-Road Committee and has been asked to participate in the Connector Standardization Subcommittee as it works to determine the need for connector standardization for buses and non-road vehicles. 3.3.8 Training Programs for Emergency Response ARB is required to work with the State Fire Marshal and other state and local emergency response officials and towing companies to create a comprehensive training program to ensure preparedness for incidents involving EVs. Similar to the Building Code Working Group, the California Energy Commission formed the Emergency Response Working Group with ARB, the California Office of the State Fire Marshal, the California Highway Patrol, utilities, auto manufacturers and industry organizations such as the California Electric Transportation Coalition. The purpose of the working group was to develop training designed to inform emergency response personnel about EVs and the differences in response procedures for incidents involving EVs. In 1998, the Emergency Response Working Group completed the development of a training program consisting of material to train instructors, an instructor's manual and compact disc, and slide teaching materials and student manuals. Train-the-trainer courses have been held throughout the state. Through the Infrastructure Working Council, the complete package of training materials has been distributed to every state Fire Marshal Office in the United States. Some local Councils of Government have taken the initiative to train their member jurisdictions. To staff's knowledge, no public safety issues have arisen regarding the safety of EVs or the actions of emergency response personnel in responding to an EV accident. 3.3.9 Observe Activities of the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) The MOAs require ARB to maintain its commitment to observe the activities of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) regarding the development of advanced technology batteries. The mission of the USABC is to pursue research and development of advanced energy systems capable of providing future generations of electric vehicles with significantly increased range and performance. The USABC has defined Mid-Term, Intermediate-Term (""Commercialization"") and Long-Term criteria that set forth increasingly stringent goals for acceptable electric vehicle performance and economics. Now widely accepted as goals for ongoing development, these criteria are viewed by the  30   Staff Report August 7, 2000 USABC as the minimum standards that must be met if EVs are to be acceptable to a significant percentage of vehicle users. Through the USABC, the three large U.S. vehicle manufacturers are committed to development of advanced batteries in keeping with their MOA obligation. ARB staff continues to attend the USABC Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings on a quarterly basis. By attending these meetings, ARB staff is able to monitor the progress of USABC contracts with various developers and gain insight as to the contractors' progress. While much of the information obtained is confidential, the following provides a general overview of current USABC activities and developments. The USABC completed its developmental efforts for Mid-Term battery technologies in 1999. The SAFT nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and Ovonic Battery Company (OBC) NiMH technologies successfully demonstrated improvements in battery performance, cycle life, and cost reduction. For example, compared to the USABC Mid-Term goals of 80 Whr/kg, 150 W/kg, and 1,000 cycle life, both developers have achieved at least 70 Whr/kg, 150 W/kg, and 800 cycles. In fact, the SAFT technology has realized a cycle life well in excess of 1,000 cycles. For hybrid applications, where power is of greater importance than energy, OBC has achieved specific power levels surpassing 750 W/kg. While the cost of each NiMH technology is currently more than twice the USABC Mid-Term goal of $150/Kwhr, both manufacturers have successfully reduced production cost by over 25 percent during the last two years. Current USABC programs are focused on long-term battery technologies and meeting the USABC Commercialization and Long-Term and goals. Two major contracts are currently in place investigating lithium-based battery technologies. The SAFT Lithium-Ion contract is currently in Phase I of the development process and is primarily focused on cell and module optimization. The LithiumPolymer contract is also at the development phase with promise to offer a safe and cost effective battery technology within the next five years. These lithiumbased technologies are expected to achieve specific energies well in excess of 100 Whr/kg. Improved specific power of greater than 200 W/kg and a cycle life of more than 600 are also expected. The key characteristic of battery cost should also benefit from these two technologies. The USABC is expected to initiate a Phase III program this year. Phase III funding will be approximately $62 million and span a total of four years. USABC has indicated that those technologies capable of realizing the long-term goals will be considered. 3.3.10 Reasonable Incentives  Under the MOAs, ARB must support the development and implementation of reasonable incentive programs that enhance the near-term marketability of  31   Staff Report August 7, 2000 ZEVs. Because ZEVs are a relatively new technology and are currently produced in limited quantities, they are more expensive than conventional vehicles. To enhance vehicle marketability in the near term and to assist in the transition to large volume production, it is vital to provide support, both monetary and non-monetary, in the form of vehicle and infrastructure incentives. Where possible, the ARB and other state agencies have supported the development and implementation of various incentive programs. The California Energy Commission has continued to support vehicle buy-down programs at the district level and has recently provided matching funds for the development of EV infrastructure. Recent legislation authored by Assembly Member Cuneen and signed by Governor Davis allows single occupant vehicles with ""inherently low emissions"" (ZEVs, as well as vehicles using alternative fuels, with extremely low tailpipe emissions and zero evaporative emissions) to use high occupancy vehicle lanes. The following list provides an example of the federal, state, local and private incentive programs currently available. 3.3.10.1    Federal Incentives    Tax credit for 10 percent of the cost of an EV, up to $4,000, through 2004. Business tax deduction of $100,000 for electric recharging sites. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorized a ten year $50 million EV demonstration program and a fifteen year $40 million cooperative program between government and industry to research, develop and demonstrate EV infrastructure. (To date no funds have been appropriated for this purpose.) Elimination of the luxury tax for alternative-fueled vehicles. State of California Incentives  3.3.10.2        Incentives are available to reduce the lease cost of EVs. In general half of the funding is provided by the California Energy Commission, with matching funds from local air quality management districts. The air district programs are described below. CEC funds support the installation of EV charging infrastructure by new purchaser or lessee. PVEA funds are made available to local governments to support the lease of alternative fuel vehicles. Senate Bill 1782 (Thompson, 1997) reduced the vehicle registration fee for EVs by charging EVs an amount corresponding to the fee that would be due for a comparable conventional vehicle. As of July 1, 2000, EVs with the appropriate permit sticker are allowed access to HOV lanes regardless of the number of occupants.  32   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3.3.10.3  Local Incentives              The Mobile Source Reduction Committee (MSRC) of the South Coast Air Quality Management District was the first to offer public and private customers an EV buydown. A $5,000 rebate per EV purchased or leased is available through their Quick Charge EV buy-down program. The MSRC, through its ZEV Purpose Built Buy-Down Program, has provided incentives to fleets in the South Coast Air Basin that have purchased or leased a minimum of ten ZEVs. This program has provided incentives for 400 EVs at $5,000 each for the United States Postal Service. The MSRC in conjunction with the CEC and auto manufacturers provides incentives for consumers or fleets using the Quick Charge and/or Purpose Built Fleet Buy Down incentives to defray the cost of installing a charger at one's home or worksite. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) ""Charge!"" program offers grants to subsidize installation of public EV charging stations. To date $150,000 has been awarded for 26 sites, and additional funds are available. The BAAQMD's Vehicle Incentive Program (VIP) provides public agencies with $6,000 per highway ZEV, $3,000 per city ZEV and $1,500 per neighborhood and three-wheeled ZEV. In conjunction with the CEC, several Air Pollution Control Districts offer $5,000 for the purchase or lease of EVs for public and private customers. The Los Angeles Airport offers free parking and charging for EVs in its Central Terminal Area. Charging stations were installed at the Los Angeles Airports as part of the Quick Charge Los Angeles EV program. The City of Sacramento offers free EV parking and charging at city garages. The City of San Francisco is installing EV charging at city garages. The City of Vacaville provides $6,000 per EV purchased or leased as well as incentives to city fleets and for charging infrastructure. Utility Activities  3.3.10.4      The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company all provide ""time of use"" rates to retail EV customers. Time of use rates are very low during hours in which demand is low, such as off-peak and overnight when most EVs are being charged. Additional electricity use during these hours can benefit utilities by using existing capacity built to meet peak demand but otherwise lying idle, and by allowing more efficient generation by online power plants. These time of use rates typically result in at least a fifty percent reduction in the cost of charging, with rates around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The shareholders of San Diego Gas and Electric have provided $50,000 in seed money to help local businesses and governments install charging stations in the utility's service area. To encourage market development, California's electric utilities have been loaning electric vehicles to their public and private customers since the early  33   Staff Report August 7, 2000 1990's. While this activity is not part of the MOAs, it indicates active support for the ZEV program. In addition to the incentives and other activities described above, the ARB has been working cooperatively with government agencies, auto manufacturers and other stakeholders to determine the most effective way to support the introduction of ZEVs into the marketplace. On problem in the development of the EV market has been the timing of incentive availability versus vehicle availability. The first incentive program, adopted by the MSRC, was in place more than a year before any vehicles were offered for lease. Now, many incentive programs are in operation but there are few vehicles available. New monetary as well as non-monetary incentives need to be investigated in addition to possible extensions of the incentives that currently exist. Many of these existing incentives were put into place prior to the 1996 amendments to the ZEV program and end prior to 2003. It would be appropriate to extend them through 2003 to foster the commercialization of ZEVs during the market-based introductory period as well as provide incentives for the vehicles at a time when they will be required in larger quantities. 3.4 Additional ARB Activities  ARB has instigated or been involved in a number of outreach programs, events and research contracts in addition to those addressed in the MOAs. Board members and staff have participated in local outreach as well as attended conferences and exhibitions promoting the use of zero-emission vehicles. 3.4.1 ARB Test Fleet The ARB has acquired a test fleet of EVs, with three GM S-10s, three GM EV1s, and two Honda EV PLUS vehicles. In an effort to gather information about the vehicles, their usage patterns, and issues associated with everyday EV use, ARB has set up a system to allow ARB employees to use the vehicles for between two days and a week. Employees are encouraged to do outreach to schools and other local groups. Participating employees are given a specific vehicle to drive for a week or a weekend and are encouraged to use the vehicle for as much of their normal driving as possible. Employees are then required to fill out a log that indicates usage pattern and any suggestions regarding vehicle usability and accessibility. This system has been very successful and gives ARB and users the opportunity to gain valuable experience with EVs and infrastructure. Based on discussions with employees and entries in the EV logbooks, these experiences are typically very positive and users find that the vehicle meets practically all their driving needs. ARB staff have also driven a wide range of other vehicles to learn first hand about their operating characteristics.  34   Staff Report August 7, 2000 3.4.2 EV Rental Demonstration Program The ARB and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) are working together to support an electric vehicle rental demonstration program. This program will provide high visibility and convenient availability of EVs. The EV Rental Demonstration has the following objectives:     Establish a successful EV rental program that will give a large number of the general public and government employees the opportunity to experience the benefits and attributes of EVs. Provide positive image of EVs for public and policy makers. Gain valuable information regarding the use of EVs in rental car fleets. Provide clean air benefits in those areas renting the EVs.  EV Rental Cars L.L.C. was chosen through a competitive bidding process to conduct the EV Rental Demonstration program. EV Rental Cars is working jointly with Budget Rent-a-Car to rent EVs. EVs are currently available for rent at the Los Angeles International Airport, the Sacramento International Airport, Ontario International Airport, and Beverly Hills. The program is slated to expand to additional Budget Rent-a-Car locations at Burbank Airport, John Wayne Airport in Orange County, and downtown Sacramento. The ARB is providing $100,000 to co-fund this program and 5 Honda EV Plus vehicles. The SCAQMD is providing $200,000. In addition, EV Rental Cars and the other subcontractors involved in the program will cost-share by contributing $252,000 in cash and $523,755 in-kind to this project. These subcontractors include SMUD, the City of Burbank, the City of Anaheim, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Southern California Edison. 3.4.3 EV Long-Term Placement Program The Honda Motor Company provided funding for Supplemental Emission Projects, as part of a Settlement Decree with ARB. The Supplemental Emission Projects include the Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program, under which 25 Honda EV Plus electric vehicles have been made available to public agencies for long-term loans (6 months to one year). The goals of the Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program are to promote greater awareness of electric vehicles among the public, familiarize senior public and private officials with electric vehicles and their capabilities, and encourage the leasing of electric vehicles by public agencies. The Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program is a three-year program, now in its first year of operation. Vehicles have been placed with a variety of public agencies:  35   Staff Report August 7, 2000              Yosemite National Park (2 vehicles) State Parks in Sacramento and San Diego (1 vehicle each) Griffith Park, Los Angeles San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Management District Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District Resources Agency Secretary Trade and Commerce Agency Secretary EV Loan Program, Bay Area (2 vehicles) and San Diego (1 vehicle) DGS State Garage Daily Rental ARB vehicle fleet (4 vehicles) EV Rental Fleet (5 vehicles)  Agencies that have received vehicles will provide a brief report at the end of the placement. The report will summarize the accomplishments of the program, identify activities in which the vehicle was used, and note any problems that occurred. This data will provide on-going information by which to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, as well as track any vehicle or charging problems that may have occurred. After agencies have concluded their loans, ARB staff will solicit new participants for the program. 3.4.4 Participation in Conferences and Exhibitions  ARB has participated in a number of conferences and exhibitions including the North American Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Conference, several international Electric Vehicle Symposia, the World Electric Vehicle Expo, the Los Angeles International Auto Show, and various Clean Cities Conferences. ARB has attended, contributed papers and/or purchased booth space at these and other gatherings. In addition, Board members and staff have participated in ride and drive programs, public relations events and technical advisory groups. 3.4.5 Outreach Events  Board members and staff have been very proactive in conducting public outreach to schools, community events, and community groups. These outreach events have been very successful at a ""grass-roots"" level. Often, a Board or staff member is accompanied by a member of the Zero-Emission Vehicle Implementation Section who may give a presentation or participate in a demonstration of the vehicle. Over the past twelve months, ARB staff using vehicles from the ARB test fleet have participated in thirty-four outreach events at schools and more than twenty other events at youth groups, fairs, Earth Day celebrations, and other similar locations. Over the same time period staff from the ZEV implementation Section participated in an additional sixteen events including Science Day at the State  36   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Capitol, Clean Air Day, and the Los Angeles International Auto Show. These events provide participants with an opportunity to gain experience with new vehicle technology and have questions answered about EV capabilities.  37   Staff Report August 7, 2000 4 4.1 VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT Introduction  In June 1999, ARB began meeting with auto manufacturers to discuss their obligations and plans for meeting the ZEV requirement in MY 2003. In December 1999 and February 2000, ARB staff visited all the large volume manufacturers in Japan and in the US to examine, first hand, the progress each manufacturer is making in preparing to meet the ZEV requirement as detailed in their product plans. Prior to the site visits, each manufacturer had provided ARB staff with product plans describing in detail how they intend to meet the MY 2003 ZEV requirement. The product plans included information regarding key development stages, decision points, and other milestones. In addition, the site visits provided ARB staff with a chance to examine prototypes of various types of advanced vehicle technologies. This chapter discusses the development status of ""pure"" zero emission vehicles, and ""full"" and ""partial"" ZEV allowance vehicles. It concludes with a discussion of new categories of vehicles such as city and neighborhood electric vehicles. These latter vehicles are discussed separately because they have different operating characteristics than full range vehicles and are intended to fill different market segments. 4.2 Pure ZEV Vehicles  This section evaluates the progress made to date in developing ""pure"" zeroemission vehicles--vehicles having no direct emissions. Vehicles can be certified as ZEVs if they produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or precursor pollutant) under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. These vehicles do, of course, result in a small amount of indirect emissions at stationary sources such as power plants or hydrogen production facilities due to the generation of electricity or hydrogen for use on board the vehicle. In the discussion of vehicle emissions (Section 9) the indirect emissions and environmental impacts from these stationary sources will be quantified in order to allow a meaningful comparison to other vehicle technologies. Pure zero-emission vehicles hold distinct air quality advantages over technologies that use a conventional fuel such as gasoline in a combustion engine. Vehicles with combustion engines inevitably exhibit deterioration that results in increased emission levels as the vehicle ages. They are also subject to becoming gross polluters if critical emission control systems fail. High volatility liquid fuels such as gasoline are responsible for significant fuel cycle emissions. For all of these reasons, vehicles with no potential to produce emissions are the ""gold standard"" of even the cleanest, most advanced new technologies.  38   Staff Report August 7, 2000 From the inception of the ZEV program, the battery electric vehicle has been the leading candidate for meeting the ZEV percentage requirements due to its stage of commercial development. Since 1990, worldwide effort in the research and development of vehicle and battery technology has advanced the prospects for the successful commercialization of electric vehicles. More recently, fuel cell technology has gained worldwide attention as a technology capable of supplanting current internal combustion engine vehicles in the market while providing zero direct emissions (when using stored hydrogen). The following sections provide a summary of the developmental status and infrastructure needs for these two technologies. 4.2.1 Battery Electric Vehicles  Battery electric vehicles were first commercialized more than one hundred years ago. After giving way to gasoline vehicles in the first part of this century, several efforts were made in the 1960's and 1970's to reintroduce and commercialize the technology. While the basic concept of today's electric vehicle remains the same, significant advances in components and vehicle technology have provided new opportunities for the use of electric drive in passenger vehicles. 4.2.1.1 Description of Technology  Battery electric vehicles use an electrochemical battery to store energy. In addition to this energy source, an electric vehicle employs an electric powertrain that includes a motor and controller. Electric vehicles use one of three different types of electric motors: DC (both series and shunt), AC-induction, and permanent magnet DC-brushless. Controllers used with these motors are usually either solid-state electronic, pulsed-width modulation with power transistors, or insulated gate bipolar transistors. Other components include the battery management system, battery charger, state-of-charge meter, charging connector, and electronic protection devices. 4.2.1.2 Development Status  Historically, the inability of batteries to store sufficient energy at a reasonable cost has limited the market for battery electric vehicles. However, considerable advances in the last ten years in component technology have greatly improved overall vehicle efficiency and thus range. By improving the efficiency of drivetrain components and optimizing the combined operation of the battery and drive train under normal operating conditions, EVs currently available can deliver nearly three times the range of EVs from the 1970's having the same amount of stored energy. Just as important, these advances have also included new designs that are projected to be cost comparable to the internal combustion engine vehicle in large volume production (not including the battery). At mandate volumes, however, cost studies conclude that electric vehicle drivetrains, not including the battery, will be more expensive than ICE vehicle drivetrains.  39   Staff Report August 7, 2000 The improved efficiency has been achieved in large part due to the improvements in efficiency of each component mentioned above and through the integrated operation of battery and drivetrain under normal vehicle operating conditions. California's electric utilities have been involved in the technology assessment of EVs for the past 10 years. Utility fleet data provides an excellent means of observing how EVs operate in daily use. Staff has received comments from the California Electric Transportation Coalition as well as workshop presentation from the fleet manager for Southern California Edison. This information indicates that today's EVs have proven reliable. The Southern California Edison EV fleet employs over 8,000 kWh of NiMH batteries that have traveled over 3 million EV miles. Some vehicles are approaching 40,000 miles with no repairs required. The battery module failure rate for the fleet has been less than 0.07 percent. 4.2.2 Fuel Cell Vehicles Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that allow for the conversion of chemical energy of fuels directly into electricity. By doing so, the technology avoids the loss of efficiency and emissions of air pollutants that occur with the use of combustion-based engines. While originally discovered in 1839, the first practical use of the technology occurred during the early years of the manned space program in the 1960's. Subsequent manned space efforts, up to and including the Space Shuttle program, have continued to rely upon fuel cells for electric power. This success, in turn, has resulted in large efforts and investments in the technology to develop fuel cell technology for both stationary and mobile applications. More focused efforts to develop the technology for transportation have resulted in significant improvements in the core technology. The key motivations for this recent interest include concern over urban pollution, a need for alternatives to a diminishing oil supply, and growing concern over global climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions from mobile sources. Because fuel cells are powered by alternative fuels, and operate at high efficiency, fuel cell vehicles can help achieve both energy efficiency and energy diversity goals. A fuel cell vehicle can either store hydrogen or obtain hydrogen through the reformation of an alternative fuel. 4.2.2.1 Description of Technology  While there are several different fuel cell technologies available for use in vehicles, the leading candidate for automotive application is the proton exchange membrane (PEM). Simply described, a fuel cell consists of a membrane, two electrodes, and gas chambers. In acid electrolyte, hydrogen reacts at the electrode, giving up electrons while hydrogen ions are passed through the  40   Staff Report August 7, 2000 electrolyte. The electrons are used to operate an electric motor that can then propel the vehicle. After transferring to the cathode side, the hydrogen ions combine with oxygen (typically from the air) and the electrons that have produced work, to form water. Since no combustion is involved, water is the only byproduct from the process. Many of the same components needed by a battery electric vehicle (e.g. the electric power train) are also necessary in a fuel cell electric vehicle. 4.2.2.2 Development Status  In 1998, the ARB contracted with a Panel of experts in fuel cell technology to assess the current status of fuel cells for transportation applications. According to the Panel's review of the technology, significant advances in fuel cell stack technology in recent years have overcome the technical barriers to attaining the performance needed for fuel cell electric vehicle engines. Efforts are now ongoing worldwide to integrate the latest fuel cell designs into fuel cell engines, and ultimately fuel cell electric vehicles. The biggest challenge now facing automakers is to package the necessary hardware and reduce the cost of the technology to a level comparable to the internal combustion engine. Based on recent visits to manufacturer research and development facilities, however, staff concludes that mass production fuel cell vehicles will not be available until beyond 2003. Manufacturers continue to advance the state of fuel cell technology. For example, recent news reports have described:      Significant improvement in fuel cell stack performance under freezing conditions Development of next generation stacks that provide higher power while reducing system size and weight Introduction of new prototype vehicles by DaimlerChrysler, Ford (Th!nk) and General Motors Development of advanced fuel system technologies Groundbreaking for the headquarters and associated support facilities for the California Fuel Cell Partnership  The availability projection noted above applies to for fuel cell vehicles that reform (or extract hydrogen from) a fuel such as methanol or fuel cell compatible gasoline on board the vehicle. The operation of a reformer, however, results in ozone precursor emissions. Thus, to achieve zero direct emissions the vehicle has to store hydrogen on board the vehicle. While this greatly simplifies the vehicle's design (e.g. no reformer), it raises new issues regarding the storage of sufficient quantities of hydrogen on the vehicle. The storage of hydrogen, even at fairly high compression (e.g. 5,000 psi), requires roughly 10 times the volume that is needed for the storage of an equivalent amount of energy in gasoline  41   Staff Report August 7, 2000 form. Because the fuel efficiency of a fuel cell is significantly higher than that of an internal combustion engine, less fuel is needed to go a given distance. Nevertheless, passenger cars are not currently able to accommodate enough hydrogen for adequate range without seriously compromising the passenger and cargo space. Manufacturers have explored options that include storing the hydrogen in lowtemperature liquid form, or bound chemically to a metal alloy. Efforts continue, but the potential for breakthroughs in hydrogen storage remains uncertain. While a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is believed to be the best long-term approach, its commercial introduction is not expected until beyond 2003. As part of research and development of fuel cell vehicles, automakers will demonstrate passenger cars using stored hydrogen in liquid form. The goal is not to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of this design, but rather to test, evaluate and refine all aspects of the fuel cell stack and engine. To address fuel cell vehicle and infrastructure issues, in April 1999 California Governor Gray Davis and industry leaders announced a fuel cell vehicle Partnership that will demonstrate clean transportation technology on California's roadways in the future. The ""California Fuel Cell Partnership - Driving the Future"" makes the state home to a unique collaboration of auto manufacturers (DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen), energy providers (BP Amoco [formerly ARCO], Shell, Texaco), fuel cell companies (Ballard Power Systems, International Fuel Cells), and government agencies (California Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission, South Coast Air Quality Management District, United States Department of Energy, United States Department of Transportation). Associate members, who bring specific expertise to aid in fuel, vehicle and bus demonstration activities, include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Linde AG, Praxair, Methanex, the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, and the SunLine Transit Agency. The Partnership will demonstrate fuel cell powered electric vehicles under real day-to-day driving conditions. The Partnership will place about 50 fuel cell passenger cars and fuel cell buses on the road between 2000 and 2003. In April 2000 the Partnership formally signaled the start of construction for a fuel cell vehicle headquarters facility in West Sacramento with a groundbreaking ceremony. The facility, which will house fuel cell electric vehicles and a hydrogen refueling station, will serve as an operations base for executing the Partnership's goals of demonstrating fuel cell vehicle technology and an alternative fuel infrastructure over the next four years. The 55,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art facility is expected to open in autumn 2000.  42   Staff Report August 7, 2000 4.3 Full and Partial ZEV Allowance Vehicles  In 1998 the ARB modified the ZEV requirement to allow ZEV credit to be earned by vehicles with near-zero emissions. This section discusses the development status of such vehicles. 4.3.1 Definitions and Requirements Under LEV II, ZEV-like vehicles may qualify to earn a ZEV allowance of between 0.2 and 1.0 per vehicle. Vehicles that qualify for a ZEV allowance of 1.0 are known as full ZEV allowance vehicles. Vehicles that qualify for a ZEV allowance of between 0.2 and 1.0 are known as partial ZEV allowance vehicles (PZEVs). Staff believes that this ZEV allowance approach towards satisfying the ZEV requirement will promote the continued development of battery-powered electric and zero-emitting fuel cell vehicles, while encouraging the development of other advanced technology vehicles that have the potential for producing extremely low emissions and some ZEV-like characteristics. Manufacturers will be able to decide which mix of vehicles makes the most technological and economic sense based on their own strengths in each area. Large automakers must meet at least 40 percent of their ZEV requirement with pure ZEVs, full ZEV allowance vehicles, or credits generated by either of these vehicle types. They may meet the remaining 60 percent of their overall ZEV requirement with PZEVs earning ZEV allowances of less than one. To earn a ZEV allowance for a vehicle, the manufacturer must, at a minimum, meet the following baseline PZEV requirements:     Certify Certify Certify Extend vehicle to 150,000 mile SULEV emission standards vehicle to zero evaporative emission standards vehicle to meet OBD II requirements for SULEVs, and performance and defects warranty to 15 years/ 150,000 miles  One important advantage of battery and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles is that their ""tailpipe"" emissions do not increase when their components fail and are in need of repair. The extended warranty requirement for PZEVs is a very important element of LEV II and is intended to address this issue. It requires manufacturers to provide a 150,000 mile emission warranty under which all malfunctions identified by the vehicle's OBD II system will be repaired under warranty for a period of 15 years or 150,000 miles (whichever occurs first). This warranty is necessary to ensure that vehicles receiving credit for near zero emissions are able to maintain this performance throughout the useful life of the vehicle, as is the case with pure ZEVs. Vehicles that meet all of these minimum or ""baseline"" requirements earn a 0.2 PZEV allowance. Since ARB regulations do not specify particular fuel or propulsion technologies, there is a wide variety of potential vehicle fuel and drive 43   Staff Report August 7, 2000 system combinations that may qualify for PZEV allowance in the coming years. The overall ZEV allowance assigned to a vehicle is the sum of 3 individual assessments:    Baseline (minimum) PZEV allowance Zero emission vehicle miles traveled (VMT) allowance or Advanced Componentry Low fuel cycle emissions allowance 0.2 0.0 to 0.6 0.0 to 0.2  Table 4-1 on the next page lists a number of existing and hypothetical vehicle types, along with estimates of the maximum potential ZEV allowance they might be eligible to earn: Table 4-1 Examples of Partial ZEV Allowance Vehicles, Full ZEV Allowance Vehicles, and ZEVs Vehicle Type (Must meet all PZEV requirements) Gasoline ICE Gasoline ICE / HEV CNG ICE LFCE ICE HEV, 0 mile ZE range Gasoline ICE HEV, 20 mile ZE range Hydrogen ICE Methanol Reformer FCV Gasoline ICE HEV, 40 mile ZE range LFCE ICE HEV, 20 mile ZE range LFCE ICE HEV, 40 mile ZE range Direct Methanol FCV Battery EV Stored Hydrogen FCV Primary Energy Source Gasoline Gasoline CNG CNG, hydrogen Grid Electricity Hydrogen FC Methanol Grid Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Electricity FC Methanol Grid Electricity Hydrogen Secondary Energy Source N/A Electricity N/A Electricity Zero Emission Range (miles) 0 0 0 0 PZEV Baseline Allowance .2 .2 .2 .2 ZeroEmission VMT Allowance 0 .1 (components) 0 .1 (components) .3 +.1 (max off-vehicle charging) .3 (0 NMOG) .3 (0 NOx) .4 + .1 (max off-vehicle charging) .3+.1 (max off-vehicle charging) .4 + .1 (max off-vehicle charging) Low Fuel Cycle Emissions Allowance 0 0 .2 .2 Total ZEV Allowance .2 .3 .4 .5  Gasoline  20  .2  .1  .7  N/A Electricity  0 0  .2 .2  .2 .2  .7 .7  Gasoline  40  .2  .16  .8  CNG, etc. CNG, etc. Electricity  20  .2  .2  .8  40  .2  .2  .9  Any Any Any  ZEV ZEV ZEV  44   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Abbreviations used in the table are: CNG: FCV : HEV: ICE: LFCE: FC Methanol PZEV SULEV VMT: ZE Range: Compressed natural gas Fuel cell vehicle Hybrid electric vehicle Internal combustion engine Low fuel cycle emissions Methanol that is compatible for use in fuel cells Partial Zero Emission Vehicle Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Vehicle miles traveled Zero-emission range  It should be emphasized that the LEV II regulations do not establish specific ZEV allowances to be earned with particular fuel or propulsion technology choices. Rather, allowances are earned according to the three factors noted above, and depend on the actual performance achieved by a vehicle with a particular fuel and propulsion technology. The examples in the table below indicate staff's current assessment of the maximum achievable allowances possible for the vehicle types shown. 4.3.2 PZEV Availability The following section outlines current information regarding the availability of production PZEVs, today and in the future (2003 and beyond). 4.3.2.1 MY 2000 PZEVs Presently Available At the present time, only the Nissan Sentra `CA' (""Clean Air"") has achieved California certification for PZEV credit. Staff does not anticipate any further applications for PZEV certification for MY 2000 vehicles. Nissan Sentra CA (Gasoline SULEV, PZEV Credit =.2) Make Nissan Model CA Emissions Class PZEV-.2 (SULEV) City/ Hwy EPA MPG 26/ 33 Primary Energy Gasoline Secondary Energy N/A Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE Secondary Propulsion N/A  The 2000 model year Nissan Sentra CA is the first vehicle to be ARB-certified to meet SULEV requirements as well as the additional warranty and evaporative emissions controls necessary to achieve a baseline PZEV rating. Several key technologies allow the Sentra CA to achieve PZEV performance levels. These include:  Double-wall exhaust manifolds,  Quicker warm-up catalyst  45   Staff Report August 7, 2000   A new combustion control sensor, and An electronically controlled swirl control valve that reduces hydrocarbon emissions in both cold and warm start situations.  In addition, the radiators of all Sentra CAs are coated with Engelhard Corp.'s PremAir coating, which converts ozone passing the radiator into oxygen. The Sentra CA will be a limited production vehicle. Sales of the Sentra CA began in April 2000 in California. 4.3.2.2 MY 2000 SULEVs Not Qualifying For PZEV Credit  In addition to the Nissan Sentra CA, three other MY 2000 vehicles have met certification requirements for the SULEV standard. These vehicles will not earn PZEV allowances, however, because they do not yet meet all of the minimum baseline requirements necessary for PZEV status. The MY 2000 Honda Accord SE has been certified to SULEV emissions standards, but has not been certified to attain PZEV allowance requirements for durability, warranty, or zero evaporative emissions at this time. The Accord SE would be eligible for a 0.2 ZEV allowance if the additional PZEV requirements were to be met. The MY 2000 Honda Civic GX is a CNG fueled ICE vehicle that is ARB certified as a SULEV and already meets zero evaporation requirements. It does not yet offer the enhanced 150,000-mile emissions warranty required for PZEV baseline certification. Honda states that they do not yet have sufficient durability data on this vehicle to justify the warranty extension necessary for PZEV certification. Since CNG fueled SULEVs that qualify for a PZEV baseline allowance of 0.2 would also be eligible to receive 0.2 allowance for low fuel cycle emissions, the Civic GX could someday qualify for a 0.4 PZEV allowance. The Toyota Prius, the Japanese version of which was the first modern-day HEV to be offered for sale, has been certified as a MY 2001 SULEV. Toyota is not expected to apply for certification to PZEV levels. As of January 2000, Toyota had delivered more than 30,000 units to customers in Japan, and US deliveries are expected to commence shortly. Although the current Prius HEV is capable of traveling very short distances in ZEV mode, it cannot attain the minimum 20-mile all electric range necessary to earn a zero-emission range allowance. (Note that all energy in the Prius battery is provided by the on-board auxiliary power unit or by regeneration--it does not use any grid electricity). If future versions of the Prius or similar gasoline HEVs with negligible zero emissions range met PZEV requirements, they would attain an overall PZEV allowance of 0.2 baseline plus 0.1 for advanced electric drivetrain componentry, for a total PZEV allowance of 0.3.  46   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Make Honda Honda Toyota Model Accord SE Civic GX Prius Emissions Class SULEV SULEV SULEV City/ Hwy EPA MPG 23/30 28/34 (equivalent) 52/45 Primary Energy Gasoline CNG Gasoline Secondary Energy N/A N/A Electricity: 1.8 kWh total energy, ~.18 kWh useful energya Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE CNG ICE Gasoline ICE, (52 kW) Secondary Propulsion N/A N/A Electric Motor, (33 kW)  a.  In operation the vehicle management system limits battery output to only a portion of its rated capacity. Other Production Vehicles With Some PZEV Characteristics  4.3.2.3  The Honda Insight is the first modern-day HEV to be offered to customers in California. It is currently certified at ULEV emissions level, so it cannot yet qualify for a PZEV baseline allowance. The Insight HEV design emphasis is on high efficiency, and hybridization enables it to achieve the highest mileage and consequently the lowest CO2 emissions of any gasoline-powered passenger car available in the United States. The Toyota Prius platform, if modified to have a larger battery, a larger electric motor, and a charging port, could serve as the basis for a vehicle with significant zero-emissions range. Because the present design of the Honda Insight powerplant links the electric motor directly to the engine, it is not capable of any motor-only, zero-emission operation. Ford has recently announced that it will be offering a 2003 MY hybrid version of its new sport utility vehicle (SUV), the Escape. This hybrid SUV is expected to achieve nearly 40 mpg (city) and will also be certified to the SULEV emission standard. The hybrid Escape is expected to provide acceleration similar to the V6 Escape, while achieving better fuel economy than the 2 liter 4 cylinder Escape (23/28 mpg city/hwy). Ford is also pursuing the development of a zero evaporative emissions system for the Escape. An Escape that met PZEV requirements would qualify for a 0.3 PZEV allowance.  47   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Make Honda Model Insight Emissions Class ULEV City/ Hwy EPA MPG 61/70 Primary Energy Gasoline Secondary Energy Electricity ~.9 kWh total, ~.09 kWh useful energya Electricity TBD Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE (54 kW) Gasoline ICE (TBD) Secondary Propulsion Electric (10 kW)  Ford  Escape  SULEV (Target)  TBD  Gasoline  Electric (TBD)  a.  In operation the vehicle management system limits battery output to only a portion of its rated capacity. Other Power-Assist HEVs  4.3.2.4  Staff expects several additional ""power-assist"" parallel HEVs to become available before 2004. These HEVs are also expected to be equipped with relatively small motors with less than 25 percent of engine power capability, and small battery packs (less than 2 kWh). Although these power-assist HEVs are designed primarily to improve fuel economy and do not necessarily reduce criteria emissions, they can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Sales of ""power assist"" HEVs would also require manufacturers to increase their design and production capability for electric motors, inverters, and battery packs, which may be used in other types of electric-propulsion vehicles. 4.3.2.5 PZEV Availability in MY 2003 and Beyond  Under the ZEV regulation, intermediate manufacturers may meet their entire ZEV obligation using PZEVs, and large manufacturers may meet 60 percent of their ZEV obligation with PZEVs. In order to take full advantage of this flexibility using 0.2 credit PZEVs, intermediate manufacturers would need to certify 50 percent of their fleet as PZEVs (50 percent of the fleet at 0.2 credits per vehicle equals 10 percent) and large manufacturers would need to certify 30 percent of their fleet (30 percent of the fleet at .2 credits per vehicle equals 6 percent). Other than the Nissan Sentra CA, discussed above, no manufacturer has announced definitive plans to market PZEVs in MY 2003. The timing of PZEV introduction likely will be affected by manufacturer-specific external cycles such as the planned retirement date for engine families and their replacement by new engines. Staff anticipates, however, that additional PZEV models will be announced prior to 2003. Manufacturers have indicated that the most difficult challenges to be met for PZEV certification are the zero evaporative emission level and the 150,000-mile emissions warranty. In public comments, Honda pointed out that it has requested information from ARB regarding specific test procedures to be used to demonstrate compliance with the zero evaporative emission requirement. Staff notes that due to the many variables involved, ARB seeks to provide maximum flexibility and has encouraged manufacturers to develop and propose test procedures appropriate to their individual systems. To date one manufacturer 48   Staff Report August 7, 2000 has successfully done so, and it is staff's understanding that other proposals are planned. GM stated in workshop testimony that due to the technical challenges, and the high volume of PZEVs it would need to produce to meet 60 percent of its ZEV requirement (roughly 65,000 vehicles at 0.2 credits per vehicle), GM will be unable to use PZEVs to meet any significant portion of its ZEV requirement in 2003. Another concern stated by GM is the potential impact on the palladium (Pd) market when introducing significant numbers of PZEVs. PZEVs would likely require very high Pd loading on catalytic converters, and with large-scale introduction of PZEVs, GM is concerned that Pd demand will exceed supply, thereby significantly increasing the price of Pd. Staff is unable to verify the likelihood of this scenario. Other large manufacturers (including Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and Toyota) have indicated that PZEVs will not be available in sufficient quantity to take full advantage of the 60 percent level allowed under the regulation for 2003. Some intermediate volume manufacturers have also noted specific concerns in meeting the ZEV requirement in the early years (i.e. before 2006). Instead of making limited lines of specialty high ZEV allowance vehicles, as may be an option for a larger manufacturer, an intermediate volume manufacturer will need to incorporate significant numbers of PZEVs into its major product lines in order to meet its ZEV requirement. Such a large-scale introduction will require a longer phase-in period. Therefore, although intermediate volume manufacturers may begin introducing PZEVs in 2003, they have stated that the volume of PZEVs that they are able to produce would not be sufficient to meet the ZEV requirement in the first year of the program. They anticipate reaching compliance within 2 to 3 years. One manufacturer has suggested that manufacturers in such situation may require an extension in meeting the ZEV requirement. 4.3.3 All Electric Range and Efficiency Improvement Both battery EVs and hybrid electric vehicles with zero-emission range that are able to charge from the electric grid can achieve high efficiency along with extremely low emissions. Today's typical battery EVs achieve efficiencies of 400-500 Whr per mile (AC) and the EV1 efficiency has been tested at 250 Whr per mile. These vehicles thus are demonstrating a plug to wheels efficiency equivalency of 77-154 MPG (assuming energy content of gasoline is 38.6 kWh/gal). This high energy efficiency results in correspondingly low CO2 emissions. Vehicle CO2 emissions are discussed more completely in Section 9 below. Although vehicle operating efficiency and CO2 emissions are not regulated by the ARB, staff recognizes that inefficient vehicles require more costly and complex systems to control criteria emissions. In addition, a malfunctioning low-efficiency gasoline vehicle operating up to 2 years between smog inspections has the potential to emit many times more emissions than a faulty high-efficiency vehicle.  49   Staff Report August 7, 2000 4.3.4 Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) is a collaboration between the United States Government and the large domestic automakers. The longterm goal of the PNGV is to develop vehicles that will deliver up to three times today's fuel efficiency (80 miles per gallon) and cost no more to own and operate than today's comparable vehicles. At the same time, this new generation of vehicles should maintain the size, utility and performance standards of today's vehicles. The PNGV program near-term development emphasis has been on dieselpowered vehicles, because its goals are narrowly focused on fuel efficiency. The Partnership has, however, also funded developments that may have significant impact on future emissions reductions. Program contractors have developed improvements in lightweight materials, high-power batteries, fuel cell components, and reductions in vehicle road-load. For example, a recent PNGVfunded prototype announcement for the GM Precept discloses an extremely low aerodynamic drag coefficient of .163, which is less than one-half of the drag exhibited by a typical modern car. The ability of auto manufacturers to reduce aerodynamic drag to these extraordinarily low values will substantially reduce the power and energy storage requirements of future ZEVs and PZEVs, and may accelerate the introduction of cost-effective near-zero or zero emission vehicles. 4.3.4 HEVs With Significant Zero Emission Range Three PZEV allowances are added together to determine a vehicle's overall allowance. One of these three, the zero-emission VMT allowance, is based on the potential for realizing zero-emission vehicle miles traveled, and is determined as shown in the graph below.  50   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Partial ZEV Allowance for Zero-Emission Range 0.60  0.50 Partial Allowance  0.40  0.30  0.20  0.10  0.00 0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 AER (Urban Drive Cycle) 80.00 100.00 120.00  During the development of LEV II, ARB staff believed that manufacturers would develop HEVs with battery packs that were smaller and less expensive than those needed for battery EVs, but still big enough to provide significant ZEV range and to justify recharging from the electric grid. These smaller packs for HEVs might have an energy storage capacity as low as 10-15 kWh instead of 30+ kWh in battery EVs, but would be sufficient to enable vehicles to attain a relatively large zero emission VMT allowance. Based on public announcements to date, however, staff does not believe that grid-charged hybrid electric capability will be made available on any MY 2000-2003 vehicles. The only hybrid electric vehicles expected during this time will probably be equipped with very small battery packs of less than 2 kWh capacity that are charged from gasolinederived energy only. While LEV II was written to encourage vehicles with zeroemissions range like grid-connected HEVs because of their low emissions, high efficiency, and other ZEV-like attributes, it is unlikely that manufacturers will make use of this option to achieve higher PZEV allowances for zero-emission range before 2004. Automotive manufacturers and researchers have, however, developed and demonstrated several prototype HEVs that demonstrate significant zero-emission range and are able to charge their battery packs with grid-supplied electricity. No manufacturer has announced when these types of HEVs will become available, and most cite the same primary obstacle that has resulted in the slow introduction of battery EVs--high battery cost. Although many of these advanced prototypes would not yet meet ARB's SULEV requirements, with further engine refinement to SULEV standards they would achieve very high PZEV credits because of their ZEV range capability. Examples of functional concept ""grid connected"" hybrid vehicles include:  Several GM EV-1 based show cars,  GM Triax,  51   Staff Report August 7, 2000      DOE/ SAE Futurecar and Futuretruck Student-competition HEVs, Suzuki EV Sport, Volvo HEV, Ovonic-Modified (grid connected) Toyota Prius, Audi Duo.  Studies of the feasibility of such vehicles are underway, including work at U.C. Davis and EPRI. Staff believes that such vehicles offer many potential advantages, which justify their favorable treatment under the ZEV credit mechanism. Cost remains an obstacle due to the larger battery packs required for significant all-electric range. 4.4 On-Road Low Speed and City Electric Vehicles  Several classes of small on-road electric vehicles have begun to emerge in the last few years that will displace gasoline vehicle usage and increase overall zeroemission miles traveled within California. These vehicle types include low speed vehicles (LSVs).and city electric vehicles (CEVs). LSVs are not necessarily electric; LSVs that use electric drive are also referred to as neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs). In this staff report we use ""LSV""--the legal classification adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--to refer only to electric drive vehicles. The specific characteristics of these vehicle types are discussed in more detail below. LSVs and CEVs are under consideration because they offer a number of desirable characteristics:  Very high efficiency  Affordable to build, and affordable to purchase  LSV performance is adequate with existing, affordable, lead acid batteries  CEV battery pack energy storage requirements are only about 1/3 that of a full sized EV, so the latest battery technology can be more affordable.  Reduced congestion (possible to park two LSVs in a single parking space)  Many potential niche market applications (station cars, resorts, theme parks, national parks, campuses, planned communities). 4.4.1 Background--Emerging Small EV Classes Small EVs exhibit a wide range of capabilities and performance levels. They may be broadly classified as shown on the next page. Similar characteristics for full-range EVs are shown for comparison purposes. Under current state law and ARB regulation, LSVs and City EVs all qualify as ""passenger cars"" and therefore are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. In terms of trip replacement and the resulting air quality impact, however, it is clear that a LSV, City EV, and a full-range EV differ significantly. ARB staff plan to better quantify the relative air quality benefits of the various new categories of vehicles. 52   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Vehicle Type DOT Class Curb Weight Energy Storage Capacity 0.3- 2.8 kWh Drive System Peak Power ~1kW~10 kW Maximum Speed Typical Rangea Examples  e-bikes, scooters, motorcycles, etc. b LSV  N/A  Varies  Varies  less than 20 miles 20-30 miles  ZAP, ebike, etc.  LSV (Low Speed Vehicle) PC  950-1400 lbs.  4-9 kWh  ~5-15 kW  City EV (CEV)  18002500 lbs. typ.

Not eligible for ZEV credit.  4.4.2 City EVs (CEVs) This emerging class of vehicles is much smaller than most American vehicles and exhibits lower performance than the ICE vehicles currently available on the American market, but they are much more car-like than LSVs. Although the current prototypes listed below are not yet safety certified, production City EVs sold in the United States in quantities greater than 2,000 will be required to meet all existing federal DOT/Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) requirements for equipment and crash protection. All are equipped with dual air bags, and many offer anti-lock braking systems. Examples of near-term CEVs include:  53   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Make Toyota Model e-Com Passengers 2 Curb Weight 1742 lbs. 2046 lbs. TBD 1852 lbs. 2310 lbs.

Test cycle range. Real world driving range will be less.  Auto manufacturers are planning to sell large quantities of CEVs elsewhere in the world, especially in countries where fuel prices are relatively high or gasoline infrastructure is scarce. Most City EVs fit within the Japanese ""microcar"" classification limits, which restrict vehicle size to a length of less than 3400 mm (11 feet 2 inches) and a width of less than 1480 mm (4 feet 10 inches). In Japan, there is growing interest in this ""microcar"" class of for use as second vehicles. Some City EVs whose lengths are less than 2500 mm (8 feet 2 inches) are capable of parking 2-to-a-parking space to help avoid urban congestion. In countries where fuel costs are high, CEVs will be able to provide lower cost of ownership even in the relatively low build quantities expected in the early years of production. They are equipped with battery packs that are approximately one third the capacity (and cost) of those found in full-size, full-performance EVs. City EVs are also expected to demonstrate better operating efficiency than larger EVs and LSVs. All CEVs currently proposed are planning to make use of advanced battery technology (NiMH or LiIon). Toyota is providing a fleet of 13 left-hand drive eComs for a demonstration program in Irvine, California. This program will be run by UC Irvine's National Fuel Cell Research Center in cooperation with Toyota. The e-Com can charge at either 120 VAC Level I or Level II Inductive charging stations. The Th!nk City is currently available for lease in Scandinavia. Plans are for 700 units to be imported into the US in 2000, with more than 300 of them coming to California for demonstration programs. Safety features include a driver-side airbag and seat belts with pre-tensioners. Nissan's Hypermini is the only City EV that is presently equipped with Lithium Ion batteries. Safety features include both dual airbags and anti-lock brakes. A Nissan Hypermini station car demo program in Yokohama began in January 2000, with others to follow. Thirty vehicles are allocated for demonstration in California beginning this year.  54   Staff Report August 7, 2000 4.4.3 Low Speed Vehicles (LSVs) Low speed vehicles have a curb weight of under 1800 lbs., are equipped with speed limiting devices that limit maximum speed to 25 mph, and are restricted to use on roads with posted speed limits of under 35 mph. This vehicle class was legalized on a community basis in California with the passage of Assembly Bill 110 in 1999. Arizona was the first state to legalize LSVs on a statewide basis. LSVs are not necessarily electric drive. In practice we expect that the vast majority of LSVs in California will be electric drive, and in this document we use the term LSV to refer to electric drive vehicles. An LSV with electric drive is also referred to as a Neighborhood Electric Vehicle. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has excluded LSVs from the category of ""passenger car"" and defined a new Federal Low-Speed Vehicle class to establish minimum safety and equipment standards for these vehicles (49 CFR Parts 531.3 and 571.500). These regulations define a LSV as ""a 4-wheeled vehicle, other than a truck, whose speed attainable in 1.6 km (1 mile) is more than 32 kph (20 mph) and not more than 40 kph (25 mph) on a paved level surface"". Federal requirements do not require LSVs to make use of electric propulsion. The California vehicle code was modified under Senate Bill 186 to accommodate this new federal classification, and these vehicles have been legal for use on public roads statewide since January 2000. Under California law and ARB regulation, however, LSVs qualify as ""passenger cars"", even though they are subject to different crash test requirements. Thus federal and state law differ on this point. Because they qualify as passenger cars under state law, LSVs are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. Another important distinction between Federal and California law is California's additional restriction of unladen weight to 1,800 lbs. or less. Although these vehicles appear to be similar to golf carts, they offer substantially more performance, better safety features, and are much more road worthy. LSVs are generally capable of much better acceleration than golf carts and can achieve 25 mph quite rapidly. Golf cart performance is restricted in accordance to cooperative industry standards to 13-15 mph, due to safety and turf maintenance concerns on golf courses. LSVs are usually equipped with higherpressure road tires that might damage turf if used on a golf course, and LSVs must also be equipped with much better brakes than would be needed on a golf course. At the present time, all LSVs on the market are purpose-built designs intended for use as LSVs and are not derivatives of existing golf-cart designs. These improvements also increase the price of a LSV to more than $3,000, which is more than a typical electric golf cart. At the present time, LSVs do not display efficiency labeling, as is required of all other road vehicles. Present EPA test procedures specify that the test vehicles must operate at speeds that are above the capability of LSVs, so the existing test  55   Staff Report August 7, 2000 procedure cannot be used to measure the fuel economy or range of these vehicles. Although test information is not yet available for these vehicles, it is believed that their operating efficiency may not be nearly as high as that of City EVs, which are equipped with much more technologically sophisticated componentry. In many cases, it is possible that LSV operating efficiency may even be poorer than that of full-size and full-range battery EVs. These vehicles generally have battery pack capacities of about 8 kWh, but the pack cost is quite low due to the low cost of the batteries used. Examples of near-term LSVs are as follows: Make Th!nk Th!nk Bombardier GEM GEM GEM GEM Model Neighbor Neighbor NV E 825 E 825 E 825-2 E 825-4 Passengers 2 4 2 2+ short bed pickup 2+ long bed pickup 2 4 980 1200 980 1280 Curb Weight 950 lbs. 1200 lbs.

Test cycle range. Real world driving range will be less.  Deliveries of the Th!nk Neighbor are scheduled to commence in November, 2000. It will be available for sale at selected Ford dealers, via the internet, and at other unspecified outlets, and base price is expected to be approximately $6,000. Bombardier was the first LSV to apply for ARB certification. The Bombardier vehicles make use of sealed, maintenance-free lead acid batteries, and are available at a base price of $6,199. GEM has received certification for its MY 1999 vehicles. Prices vary with model, and range from $7,000 to $10,000. Unlike some other LSV models, the GEM charging circuitry is designed to be compatible with existing, 120 VAC commercial GFCI-equipped outlets. GEM LSVs are the only ones equipped with flooded lead-acid batteries (all others are sealed designs), and will therefore require battery maintenance. GEM recommends checking/ adding battery water to each cell at least once a month. As noted above, although LSVs are not ""passenger cars"" under federal law, under current state law and ARB regulation LSVs qualify as ""passenger cars"" 56   Staff Report August 7, 2000 and therefore are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. Due to their limited range and functionality, it is apparent that such vehicles will replace far fewer vehicle miles traveled, or trips, than City EVs or full range EVs. Staff thus has significant concerns regarding how such vehicles should be treated for ZEV credit purposes. ARB staff plan to evaluate the use and resulting emission benefits of such vehicles as information becomes available.  57   Staff Report August 7, 2000 5 5.1 BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT The Battery Panel  The cost of batteries, both today and when produced in volume, is one of the most critical parameters of this review. To obtain the best available assessment, the ARB has contracted with a team of outside experts. The Year 2000 Battery Technology Advisory Panel has met with leading battery suppliers and auto manufacturers. Their task was to review the state of the art regarding advanced battery design and manufacturing techniques, and report back to staff regarding likely cost trends for 2003 and beyond. The Executive Summary of the Panel's draft final report is attached to this Staff Report as Appendix A. The full text of the Panel's report is available on the ARB Biennial Review website at http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/2000review/2000review.htm. Interested parties have been given the opportunity to comment on the draft final report. Comments received to date have been conveyed to the Panel for their consideration. The final report will be available to the public at the September 7, 2000 Board hearing and will reflect the comments and feedback received as appropriate. 5.2 Range vs. Cost  The current structure of the ARB regulatory and incentive scheme for ZEVs and partial ZEVs is intended to encourage the development of advanced batteries that will allow battery EVs to achieve extended range, long battery life, and lower lifecycle cost. For example, additional credit is given in the near term for ZEVs with a range of greater than 100 miles. This approach has been taken in order to encourage the development of vehicles with sufficient range to cover the majority of trips taken by typical drivers. Such range has been thought to be necessary to achieve mass-market penetration. In addition, the use of advanced batteries has the potential to extend the life of the battery pack compared to conventional lead acid batteries, and thereby reduce the need to replace battery packs during the vehicle life. It has long been assumed that technical advances will reduce the cost of advanced batteries such that in addition to providing extended range, they will be more cost effective than conventional batteries on a lifecycle cost basis. Some parties have argued that the ARB preference for advanced batteries should be revisited. Proponents of this view make the case that lead acid batteries may be cost-effective in several EV and HEV configurations, and they question whether the increased range afforded by advanced batteries justifies the extra cost. They also note that lead acid batteries are well suited for fast charging. Others have argued that one appropriate niche for battery EVs could  58   Staff Report August 7, 2000 be smaller, shorter-range vehicles for urban and commuter use, and that the ARB incentive structure should not discourage such applications. Two threads of public comment that relate to this issue were presented at the March workshop. First, many EV drivers of lead acid vehicles testified that their existing vehicles provide more than adequate range for their daily driving needs. (This point is discussed in more detail in Section 7, of this report, EV Market.) They see no advantage to batteries that provide additional range at an increased cost, and would not take advantage of such an opportunity. Second, one speaker presented an analysis of the ""cost of increased range"". In this analysis, the cost of an advanced lead acid vehicle was compared to that of a nickel metal hydride vehicle with greater range. This speaker concluded by recommending that the ARB eliminate the 100-mile minimum electric range threshold for granting multiple ZEV credits. This would allow shorter-range vehicles to qualify for multiple credits, and in the view of the speaker would increase the options available to ZEV manufacturers and purchasers. One possible outcome of this scenario would be a shift towards shorter-range, less expensive lead acid vehicles. One other effect of such a change would be that larger NiMH vehicles (GM S-10, Ford Ranger, and DaimlerChrysler EPIC), which under the current regulation only get a 1.0 credit because their electric range is less than 100 miles, would get multiple credits. Specifically, if the ZEV multiple credit line were to be linearly extended below 100 miles, in 2003 the S-10 and the EPIC would get about 1.8 credits, while the Ranger would get about 1.2 credits. Thus, without a shift to lower-range lead acid vehicles, fewer vehicles would be necessary to comply with the 2003 requirement. The staff cost analysis, presented in Section 8, contains a detailed comparison of lifecycle costs for lead acid and NiMH batteries in a variety of vehicle configurations. 5.3 Possible Actions to Reduce Battery Cost  In public comment, several parties suggested that battery cost could be reduced if there were greater standardization in several key areas, including:    The size and shape of different types of battery packs (NiMH, LiIon, PbA) so that battery packs could be readily switched out without changes to the vehicle. Voltage levels among the various manufacturers of NiMH and among the three battery chemistries. Battery management systems, both thermal and electrical management.  59   Staff Report August 7, 2000 It also was suggested that guaranteeing a high volume of battery orders to one or more manufacturers could decrease battery cost. Battery manufacturers have indicated that a volume of approximately 20,000 batteries is necessary to realize economies of scale in battery production. Several utilities have proposed a competition among battery manufacturers that would reward the winning company or companies with a large order in return for passing on the cost saving from higher volume production.  60   Staff Report August 7, 2000 6 6.1 INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT Introduction  To achieve zero and near-zero (SULEV) emission levels, together with minimal upstream refueling emissions, the advanced technology vehicles being developed by manufacturers often require the use of fuels other than conventional gasoline. Therefore it will be critical to ensure that the necessary refueling infrastructure is in place to support their widespread introduction. Recently, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and CALSTART announced an Internet web sit that allows drivers of alternative fuel vehicles to locate refueling stations quickly and easily throughout California. The site covers electric, compressed and liquefied natural gas, propane and methanol fueling facilities. The site will also list ethanol and hydrogen fueling facilities when they become publicly available in California. Clean Car Maps is located at http://www.cleancarmaps.com. Users pick an alternative fuel and enter an address and they will receive a map with icons designating the locations of refueling sites in the area. Users can then click on the site name to get comprehensive refueling information from a web database. 6.2 Battery EVs  Public infrastructure enhances the utility of battery electric vehicles. Drivers can extend the length of their trips if they know that convenient recharging facilities will be available at their destination. The charging facilities at individual locations vary. A grocery location may be equipped with a single electric charging station. A public parking garage is more likely to provide both inductive and conductive charging stations. Major destinations will have a larger number of charging stations. For example, parking Lot 1 at Los Angles International Airport is equipped with ten inductive electric chargers and 6 conductive chargers, and Lot 6 is equipped with additional inductive and conductive electric charging stations. The public infrastructure for electric vehicle charging continues to expand in California. Currently, there are about 400 public charging stations statewide, which offer about 700 chargers--about 400 inductive and about 300 conductive. The bulk of the locations are in the greater Los Angeles/South Coast area, the San Francisco Bay area, the Sacramento Metropolitan area, and San Diego. In recent years, public infrastructure has expanded to locations in the North Coast, Central Coast, Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley. Public comments from the California Electric Transportation Coalition provide useful background on EV infrastructure. Points made in the Coalition comments include the following:  61   Staff Report August 7, 2000   Charging has been successfully deployed for large, centrally fueled fleets. Southern California Edison, for example, has 400 installed chargers with an additional 200 circuits already in place. Workplace charging requires more attention. While some employers have been slow to embrace employee charging, others have taken laudable initiatives. Apple Computers in Cupertino will offer their employees free EV charging and parking until 25 percent of the vehicles that employees drive to the Apple site are electric. There are still two competing charging technologies, with a single charging standard no closer. Both charger types have proven convenient to use and reliable. Because of the vehicles available, conductive chargers dominate fleet applications, while inductive chargers are more evenly divided between fleet and consumer applications,. Prices have come down for both inductive and conductive charging equipment over the past two years, although some chargers are still subsidized by their manufacturers and automakers. Innovations currently being implemented may help reduce equipment and installation costs further. For example, the United State Postal service \fleet will test a conductive dualhead conductive charger that requires no manual intervention to switch from charging one vehicle to another. Use of this type of charger allows for a lower installation cost. Other innovations such as multiple chargers on a single pedestal, or load management systems, will reduce the cost of infrastructure installation per vehicle even further. In addition, one manufacturer has developed a Level 2+ conductive charger that could provide faster charging at a minimal incremental cost. Failure rates for chargers have been lower than expected, averaging less than 2 percent where data are available. To date most repairs have been covered under warranty, although with some chargers now coming out of their 3-year warranty period that will change. Fast charging has been successfully demonstrated. Chrysler's EPIC minivan is successfully using fast charging for airport shuttle vehicles, demonstrating economic feasibility in a centrally fueled fleet. Fast charging will become more economic as the number of EVs on the road increases.          In public comments, manufacturers noted the extensive efforts by some automakers to develop EV infrastructure. Many of these efforts in the areas of building code revisions, inspector training, and similar preparatory work are discussed in more detail in Section 3 above. Manufacturers also noted that the installed base of public electric vehicle chargers is sparse relative to the installed base of gasoline pumps, especially when the long recharge time needed for electric vehicles is taken into account. ARB staff will continue participating in efforts to expand public infrastructure for electric vehicles. There do not appear to be any barriers that would prevent the expansion of public charging as needed to accommodate increasing numbers of  62   Staff Report August 7, 2000 EVs on the road. ARB staff has, however, identified several areas that warrant review in the near term:  Centralization and maintenance of up-to-date information on public charging station locations and operational status, with dissemination of the information via Internet and annual publication (currently being provided by CalStart and Clean Car Maps). Review and revision, if appropriate, of the criteria for selecting public charging locations to take into account recent increases in electric vehicle range. Modification of the public infrastructure to accommodate upgrades to chargers and connectors, and additional electric charging technologies. Development of state regulations and local ordinances to discourage parking of internal combustion engine vehicles (""ICEing"") at electric vehicle charging stations. Promotion of a courtesy charging protocol to allow more than one user access to a single electric charging station.       One issue of concern that can affect both the cost and utility of public charging is the lack of progress towards a single electric vehicle charging standard. This could increase the cost for installing or retrofitting existing public charging stations if a decision for a uniform standard is not made well before the public charging system is expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of vehicles on the road. ARB has previously considered the possibility of establishing standards that would govern the type of charger to be installed when public agencies provide incentives or funding for public infrastructure. Staff believes that ARB has the regulatory authority to establish standards for electric vehicle charging systems. It was suggested at the workshop that ARB consider the establishment of a Technical Advisory Panel to make recommendations to ARB on this issue. 6.3 Grid-Connected Hybrid Vehicles  Grid-connected HEVs are generally expected to make use of the same public and private electric charging infrastructure that is currently being installed for battery EVs. One possible difference between battery EVs and PZEV HEVs would be a potential reduction in the demand for higher-power (Level II) charging stations, due to the fact that such HEVs can run on APU power when their battery packs are depleted. It may even be possible for 20 to 40 mile zeroemission range HEVs to make significant use of Level 1 charging (standard 120 VAC), because the smaller battery packs in these HEVs will be able to accumulate useful charge in reasonable time periods with more commonly available Level 1 outlets.  63   Staff Report August 7, 2000 6.4 Fuel Cell Vehicles  In addition to testing vehicles, the California Fuel Cell Partnership (discussed in section 4.2.2.2 above) will also identify fuel infrastructure issues and prepare the California market for this new technology. Initial demonstration vehicles will run on hydrogen, directly from tanks on board the vehicles. Subsequent demonstration vehicles are likely to run on methanol fuel. Technology for other liquid fuels such as a cleaner form of gasoline will be evaluated. A key goal of the Partnership is to determine the best fuel infrastructure for the market entry of fuel cell vehicles. The Partnership will be devoting considerable attention to fuel cell fuel infrastructure issues. Staff will monitor the Partnership's efforts in this regard and report on status as appropriate. 6.5 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles  There are currently about 230 CNG vehicle refilling stations in California, of which 104 are available to the public. Most of these are ""fast fill"" type stations that are capable of refilling CNG vehicles in as little as 2 to 4 minutes. Although the ""fast fill"" fuel dispensing infrastructure is relatively sparse, low pressure natural gas is already delivered to most residences in California. Thus manufacturers are working to develop ""time fill"" devices that would be suitable for home refueling use. These ""time fill"" devices may take 6-8 hours (overnight) to fill a vehicle, but their availability could make dedicated CNG vehicles a much more viable option for non-fleet users.  64   Staff Report August 7, 2000 7 7.1 THE EV MARKET Introduction  One key issue, as we look to 2003, is the nature and extent of expected market demand for electric vehicles. Does a market exist for a large number of electric vehicles? Of all the issues associated with the zero emission vehicle regulation, this one appears to generate the greatest divergence of opinion and the most strongly held beliefs. It is also the question for which the least amount of hard data is available. Several basic points have emerged in the course of staff's investigation, workshop testimony, and subsequent public comment:  Those companies that actively marketed EVs to retail customers (GM and Honda) made broad-based promotional efforts that attempted to assess the potential retail market for EVs. Other manufacturers used marketing efforts appropriate for the fleet market. Customer demand for the vehicles, as evidenced by actual leases, was limited under the circumstances and conditions that prevailed in the initial marketing period, and fell short of manufacturer expectations. For many months the available inventory of vehicles was in excess of customer demand. At present, due to the halt in EV production by most manufacturers, the demand for vehicles exceeds the available supply, both for retail customers and for fleets. It is unclear if demand exceeds the level that prevailed during the time that vehicles were available. The performance characteristics of today's EVs meet a wide variety of potential applications. Drivers of EVs report using the vehicle more than they expected to, and the EV is nearly always the vehicle of choice for trips within its range. The process of leasing an EV, as reported by EV drivers and those who attempted to lease vehicles, has been described as far more difficult than the process of acquiring a conventional vehicle. Although the evidence presented is anecdotal, rather than survey-based, staff believes that taken as a whole this testimony provides persuasive evidence that such difficulties indeed have occurred in real world EV leasing. Different parties have come to markedly different conclusions regarding the EV market for 2003.            To further address market related issues, this chapter first discusses EV market demand as evidenced to date. It then discusses the potential market in 2003. Finally, it outlines key elements needed to mount a successful EV marketing effort consistent with the 2003 regulation.  65   Staff Report August 7, 2000 We recognize that considerable time and effort could be spent debating the strengths and weaknesses of the manufacturers' past efforts. The central issue before the Board, however, is what is likely to occur under the very different circumstances of 2003. Thus our focus throughout the Biennial Review process is on looking forward rather than backward. 7.2 EV Market Experience to Date  This section summarizes available information regarding EV marketing experience, drawing upon staff's review of marketing strategies and efforts undertaken to date by manufacturers, the results reported during the MOA placement programs, testimony at the March 2000 and May 2000 workshops, and public comment. 7.2.1 Manufacturer Marketing Strategies and Efforts In letters dated September 28, 1999, and November 2, 1999, ARB staff requested information on auto manufacturers' marketing activities since the initial ZEV launch. All auto manufacturers responded to the request in a timely manner. The manufacturers offered a variety of EV platforms to the marketplace. Only General Motors offered more than one platform. The majority of the manufacturers targeted fleet commercial customers to meet their MOA obligations. Two manufacturers, GM and Honda, had retail customers as their primary market targets. Table 7-1 below describes each manufacturer's market target groups and its EV platform. The majority offered their EVs through threeyear leases. The leases typically covered batteries, maintenance and road service; some leases included insurance or chargers. The lead acid battery version of the Chevrolet S10 Electric truck and the Ford Ranger were offered for purchase.  66   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Table 7-1 Manufacturers' Market Targets and Vehicle Models Primary Market Target and Vehicle Model Retail Fleet/Commercial Customer Customer EPIC ( 5 passenger minivan) Ranger EV (2 passenger truck) GM EV1 Chevrolet S10 Electric (2 passenger car) (2 passenger truck) EV Plus EV Plus (4 passenger car) (4 passenger car) Altra (4 passenger minivan) RAV4 (5 passenger sport utility)  Manufacturer Daimler-Chrysler Ford General Motors Honda Nissan Toyota  The majority of the manufacturers describe the introduction of their production EV models as demonstration programs, with goals that focus on advanced battery evaluation and on market and infrastructure issues important for future growth in the EV market. To retain control over the vehicles for evaluation purposes and to protect the customer from ""demonstration"" EV technology, manufacturers offered the EVs for lease only in most cases. Several manufacturers mentioned that support of charging infrastructure was a component of their marketing of the EVs. The majority identified the fleet market approach as the most reliable and effective means to assess the operational and durability aspects of EVs. Prime fleet customers were identified as those required to purchase alternative fuel vehicles under the Energy Policy Act (EPACT), including government agencies and electric utilities, and companies wanting to promote an environmentally conscious image. Some manufacturers mentioned that they wanted to avoid ""higher risk"" factors associated with retail marketing. According to information available to ARB staff, about two thirds of the EVs in California have been placed in fleets and about one third have been placed with retail customers. Several manufacturers reported EV marketing expenditures, on a per vehicle basis, of up to several orders of magnitude higher than expenditures for similar conventional (non-electric) vehicles. ARB staff and some manufacturers attribute the higher expenditures per vehicle to the limited number of EVs being produced and the cost of the additional educational aspects of marketing to promote a new technology. However, ARB staff also received information that indicates that marketing expenditures for a newly introduced conventional car model can be similar in magnitude in the first or second year of introduction.  67   Staff Report August 7, 2000 In the Preliminary Draft Staff Report, staff stated that manufacturers focused their marketing efforts on small, narrow target audiences. In public comments, Honda has presented information indicating that its promotions and marketing efforts were broad-based, and used many of the same techniques that are used for conventional vehicle promotion and marketing. Similar comments were made with respect to GM's marketing for the EV1. Staff agrees that these promotional efforts were directed at broad market segments, and has revised this section accordingly. The next sections provide more detail regarding the activities of individual manufacturers. DaimlerChrysler. DaimlerChrysler's demonstration program has used a single EV model, the five passenger EPIC minivan. EPIC is an acronym for Electric Power Interurban Commuter. The EPIC combines the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager minivan platform with advanced electric vehicle technology and offboard chargers that provide fast recharging capability. Using the fast charge, the EPIC is capable of more than 300 miles service in a single day. Staff notes that the EPIC's charging system differs from the standard inductive and conductive systems used by all other vehicles. For a captive fleet with central recharging this is not a problem, and the fast charge capability provides significant benefits. For other applications that need to make use of public charging infrastructure, including retail public customers, the lack of a standard charging interface presents an impediment to more widespread use. DaimlerChrysler chose the minivan platform for the EPIC because of the popularity of its minivans and because of the minivan's versatility to either carry passengers or to be used as a utility vehicle. The EPIC, with a combination passenger and cargo payload of 925 pounds, has initially been marketed for lease to fleet customers. DaimlerChrysler identified governmental entities, electric utilities and commercial fleets with short-range delivery requirements as primary targets with a particular interest in the U.S. Postal Service. To meet its MOA commitment, DaimlerChrysler began to place MY 1999 NiMH battery-powered EPICs in the 1998 calendar year. To date, 185 EPICs have been placed in California. Major customers include the Xpress airport shuttle service at Los Angeles International Airport, US Postal Service offices in Harbor City and Huntington Beach, UCLA, military bases, municipalities, and business fleets. EPICs are also placed at dealers where they are used for demonstrations. DaimlerChrysler has used a target-direct-mail campaign with small incentives (including radios and flashlights), advertisements in regional business journals, literature and the normal government and utility fleet bid process to market the EPIC. Fleet managers have been invited to selected dealers for a test ride and may have been visited by DaimlerChrysler's Alternative Fuel Vehicle Sales and  68   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Marketing representatives. The primary marketing theme has been ""Meet the EPIC Electric Minivan - Batteries Included"" with emphasis on the EPIC's practicality and zero emissions. Ford. The Ranger EV truck is the single model used in the Ford demonstration program to date. Based on Ford's best-selling compact truck platform, the Ranger EV has a regular cab and payload capacity of 700 pounds if equipped with lead-acid batteries, or 1,250 pounds with NiMH batteries. Ford first introduced its lead-acid battery-powered version of the Ranger EV pickup truck in 1998. The NiMH version was made available in 1999. Prior to introducing the Ranger EV, Ford conducted focus groups, marketing clinics and dealer meetings. Ford has targeted fleets for these vehicles because it perceives fleet customers as generally having shorter, more predictable driving patterns than retail customers. However, Ford has marketed the Ranger EV to both fleet and retail customers. Sales and service are through Ford dealers to provide customers with a ""mainstream"" or ""conventional car"" experience. To date, 356 Ranger EVs have been placed in California (of a total of 915 nationwide). The California customers are predominately government with some utility, private fleet, and retail customers. Ford appears to have retained about ten percent of these California Ranger EVs for demonstration purposes. Ford reports that it has 15-20 Ranger EVs scheduled continuously at various events including government fleet events, dealer events, media events and auto shows. Other Ford marketing efforts include joint marketing with utilities, telemarketing, direct mailings, Ford websites, and on-going print ads. Ford's marketing message appears to focus on the Ranger EV having the ""Best in Class"" design features of a gasoline Ranger and proven advanced EV technology to guarantee it is ""Built Ford Tough"". According to Ford, its California marketing expenditures per Ranger EV in 1999 were 6.5 times that of a comparable gasoline Ranger. In August 1999 Ford introduced additional incentives to encourage Ranger EV leasing. A reduced lease rate of $199 per month was put into effect for a Youth Awareness Program, and $7000 vouchers were made available to reduce the lease cost to public and private schools, parks, and zoos. These incentives resulted in an increase in lease rates, up to an annual rate of about 1200 vehicles per year. Ford has entered into an agreement with the United States Postal Service to provide 500 electric vehicle platforms, based on the Ford Ranger, for use as Postal Service vehicles. Most recently, Ford has announced plans to market the two passenger Th!nk City and Th!nk Neighbor vehicles in the United States--the first vehicles of that type to be offered by a major automobile manufacturer in this country. The Th!nk vehicles will be marketed to the general public. Ford has indicated that it believes a market exists in the United States for these urban  69   Staff Report August 7, 2000 commuter cars, and has recently undertaken a television advertising effort featuring the Th!nk City. Various demonstration programs featuring the Th!nk and other similar vehicles are being planned. General Motors. General Motors offered two EV models in its demonstration program, the 2-passenger GM EV1 with a payload of 440 pounds and the Chevrolet S-10 Electric compact truck with a payload of 950 pounds. General Motors has marketed three versions of the EV1--the 1997 Generation I with lead acid batteries, and the 1999 Generation II with advanced lead acid or with NiMH batteries. The EV1 has been marketed for retail applications, with 768 placed in California. The Chevrolet S-10 Electric, offered with lead-acid or nickel-metal hydride batteries, has been marketed for commercial applications with 227 placed in California, out of more than 450 placed nationwide by the end of 1999. The target customers for the Chevrolet S-10 Electric include electric utilities, government agencies, colleges and universities, theme parks, zoos and airports. In support of EV technology development and marketing, General Motors began consumer research in 1989. Their market research efforts have included a two and one-half year consumer test fleet drive program beginning in 1994 (the PrEView Drive), an early adopter marketing focus group, an EV1 owner survey, and recent market positioning research. Through customer input from the PrEView Drive, General Motors modified its EV product and determined the attributes of the early adopter target market. General Motors gave the EV1 a unique General Motors (GM) badge and served retail customers through selected Saturn dealers and an EV specialist team. Currently, 33 Saturn retailers in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento, Phoenix and Tucson lease and service the EV1. Due to the recent recall, the MY 1997 Gen I EV1 vehicles are being stored by General Motors until the engineering and validation of a new replacement charge port is completed. Drivers who lost the use of Gen I vehicles are being given the option to transition to a Gen II EV1, or wait until rebuilt Gen I EV1s are available. Staff's understanding is that demand for Gen II EV1 vehicles exceeds the available supply. General Motors has not committed to additional production at this point. General Motors marketing efforts have targeted regional market locales and used various media including television, radio, outdoor, newspaper, magazines, Internet site, direct mail, and brochures. The marketing efforts include promotional activity at schools and events, an EV1 test drive road show, and owner club support. Marketing themes have included ""Upgrade your drive. The electric car is here."", ""You can't hear it coming. But it is."", and ""Clean air goes in here. Clean air comes out here.""  70   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Honda. Honda originally intended to place roughly 75 percent of its 2-door, 4passenger EV Plus vehicles with retail consumers through selected dealers. Honda started with four dealers and market areas and expanded later to four additional dealers and market areas. To date, about one-half of the 276 vehicles placed in California have gone to retail consumers. While Honda made a deliberate decision to market the EV Plus to a broad market, the EV Plus retail customer profile was typically that of an ""Enviro Leader"" or a "" Techno Champ."" The ""Enviro Leader' was described as having a concern for society and ecology, at the vanguard of environmentalism, politically active, and pragmatic, seeking a ""mainstream EV."" The ""Techno Champ"" was described as the affluent innovator, with a technology focus, driven to make an ""EV statement"", believing the EV PLUS is the ""best EV made"", and dedicated to the EV. According to Honda, its MOA demonstration program was intended to introduce the product to the retail market, create public awareness and interest in the EV Plus, and get potential customers into the dealerships and encourage them to experience the EV Plus. Honda indicated that it made an extensive effort to market the EV Plus, and provided dealer support beyond that which is customary for Honda or the industry. To that end, Honda reported that it provided free support and training to the dealers, broadly marketed the EV Plus, encouraged and received extensive media evaluation of the product, supported numerous private and public events, placed prominent ads on a regular basis in many magazines and newspapers, and made direct mail solicitations. Marketing themes included ""A car with a cord. Sounds like Honda"" and ""Zero gallons to the mile."" Honda reported that it helped each potential customer assess the possible utility of the EV Plus by considering is operating characteristic, including its ""real world"" range of 60 to 80 miles per charge. Honda has an ongoing study of EV customers for customer satisfaction. Additionally, Honda has conducted a study of EV ""Intenders"" (those who expressed interest but did not lease the vehicle). These studies are described below. In 1999, Honda completed its MOA commitment and finished placing the last of its Honda EV Plus vehicles. Although Honda does not plan to continue production of the EV Plus at this time, it maintains the capability to resume production. Honda currently is focusing its efforts on EV Plus customer satisfaction issues, which will continue at least until the end of the vehicle leases. In addition, at the conclusion of their initial three-year leases the Honda vehicles are being re-leased, with the original customers being offered the opportunity to re-lease the vehicles at a reduced monthly rate of $299. Nissan. Nissan's demonstration program is using an all-new Altra EV 4passenger 4-door minivan with a payload of 820 pounds. The Nissan Altra EV is the first production electric vehicle that is equipped with lithium-ion batteries. Nissan outfitted the first 30 demonstration Altra EVs with data loggers that record  71   Staff Report August 7, 2000 31 different types of information on vehicle performance. Nissan also conducted various customer surveys and interviews to provide basic data for evaluation of vehicle performance, and user perception and experience. Anticipated individual buyers were identified as wealthy homeowners with a fleet of two or more vehicles. The distance between home, work and the nearest Nissan retailer would be typically 30 miles or less. These customers were also expected to be highly educated couples living in suburbs or fringe towns of major metropolitan centers. Technically savvy early adopters, and those committed to environmentally friendly products were also expected to be early Altra EV buyers. Target fleet customers were expected to be both those required to purchase alternative fuel vehicles under the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) and also those companies wanting to promote an environmentally conscious image. Initially, 30 demonstration vehicles were split evenly between the retail and fleet markets by the Los Angeles office of Nissan's American research subsidiary, Nissan Research & Development. The individual drivers are Nissan employees using the company vehicle lease program; other Altra EVs have been placed with utilities located in Northern and Southern California. A market-oriented program to place 98 demonstration Altra EVs is to be conducted by Nissan's American sales and marketing headquarters, Nissan North America. To date, 81 vehicles have been placed statewide. The Altra EV vehicles were made available to demonstration customers directly from Nissan through a comprehensive lease program. A direct lease approach was selected for this program rather than a typical dealership distribution so information would flow directly between customers and the test engineers. To date, the majority of Nissan's marketing activities focus on fleet managers, through participation in key conferences and EV events. Nissan has additionally supported various public awareness/educational events. The marketing theme was ""a friendly, high-tech electric vehicle for every day life."" After the initial California placement in 1998, Nissan decided to change to a different lithium-ion battery supplier. Due to efforts in making this change, Nissan did not produce any MY 1999 Altras. The new battery pack was incorporated in MY 2000 and was introduced in California in December 1999. Nissan plans to fulfill its MOA commitment by the end of calendar year 2001. Mazda. To date, Mazda has purchased credits to meet its MOA obligations and therefore has not offered any ZEVs under the Mazda nameplate. Toyota. The Toyota demonstration program uses a single EV model, the RAV4 EV. This EV is based on an existing platform, Toyota's 4-door, 5-passenger RAV4 sport utility vehicle. The RAV4 EV has a payload capacity of 827 pounds. Toyota considered several surveys of retail customers and placed prototypes with electric utilities before deciding to focus initial marketing efforts on major  72   Staff Report August 7, 2000 electric power utilities and fleet customers. Toyota has placed 486 RAV4 EVs in California to date (of 683 placed nationwide), primarily in electric utilities and government fleets. Toyota initially provided RAV4 EV servicing through contracted utilities and a municipality, and later expanded to offer service at a few select dealers. To reach the fleet market, Toyota has concentrated RAV4 EV advertising efforts on print ads in various fleet publications, supporting product brochures, Internet website marketing ads, and direct active participation in alternative fuel vehicle promotional events such as EV expositions, auto shows, and ""ride and drives"". Some marketing themes that Toyota has used include ""all the comforts of a RAV4 but none of the gas, oil, exhaust..."", ""the technology may be new, but the reliability is Toyota through and through"" and "" you may not be able to tell you're driving an electric vehicle. But the environment can."" In April 1999, Toyota announced that it had placed enough vehicles to satisfy its MOA commitment. Toyota continues to produce a limited number of additional vehicles beyond the required MOA level, and will continue product development and the collection of in-use information about range, performance and market acceptability of the RAV4 EV. 7.2.2 Early Market Placement Results This section describes the results of the initial EV marketing efforts by the major manufacturers. In public comments, manufacturers pointed out that for many months, when all manufacturers had products available, vehicle inventory greatly exceeded the demand for vehicles. For example, when GM first introduced the EV1, ""the majority of 1997 was characterized by steadily increasing inventory, throughout the first three-quarters of the year. There was a backlog of over a year's supply on hand that needed to be marketed and sold. The following year, sales remained at a steady but low level. All told, the number of days' supply of EV1s averaged over 200 days 80 percent of the time during the first two years of EV1 production. This level exceeds the norm of 60 days supply by over three times. There were excessive levels of inventory available for over 2 years."" Honda, the other manufacturer that offered vehicles to the general public, noted that both GM and Honda had experience of 2 years or more of retail EV promotion and availability with very little response from the general public despite significant marketing campaigns. Several manufacturers observed that from their standpoint the sale of EVs has been very labor intensive and expensive relative to conventional vehicles. For example, sales staff need extensive training, additional time and effort is needed to educate customers regarding new technology, the ratio of sales to initial  73   Staff Report August 7, 2000 inquiries is low, and much time and effort are needed to deal with infrastructure installation issues. These manufacturers indicated that the time it took to place the MOA vehicles, the lease rate adjustments made for marketing purposes, and the incentive programs offered reflect a limited fleet niche EV market. They conclude that a general EV market does not exist that would be profitable for EV dealers even with considerable support from the manufacturers for marketing, promotional materials, and sales staff and automotive technician training. In general, manufacturers argued that there are fundamental challenges to placing EVs at the required levels, due to high cost, limited range, long recharge times, value/cost perceptions and the difficulties inherent in achieving widespread market penetration with a new technology. Meanwhile, some parties have argued that the manufacturer marketing and sales efforts were intentionally half-hearted and ineffective. Staff does not subscribe to this viewpoint. Rather, staff concludes that the manufacturers made good-faith efforts to meet their MOA demonstration vehicle placement obligations. The manufacturer strategies and efforts have, after all, been successful in accomplishing their intended purpose. All MOA vehicles produced to date have been placed, and at present the number of interested customers exceeds the number of vehicles available. Through the MOA program manufacturers gathered valuable information regarding EV customer preferences and needs. 7.2.3 Measures of Customer Satisfaction In assessing the results of EV marketing to date, it is important to review the experience of those drivers using the vehicles that have been placed. One clear message provided at both workshops is that those who drive electric vehicles are extremely happy with them. Numerous drivers took personal time off from work and journeyed to Sacramento and Diamond Bar just to emphasize their satisfaction with their vehicles and their desire that the availability of ZEVs be expanded. Drivers appreciate being able to drive without directly contributing to smog, fuel spillage, climate change, or other pollution problems. In addition to such societal benefits, drivers also mentioned many desirable attributes of the vehicles that are enjoyed in everyday commuting. Drivers spoke of the convenience of home charging, the smooth, quite acceleration, the low operating cost, and vehicle reliability. In public comments, manufacturers noted that the EV drivers who testified at the workshop do not represent the population of California vehicle purchasers. This group has already self-selected to be EV owners with lifestyle and driving conditions that are acceptable to the category, and are willing to be the first to invest in new innovations. Staff agrees surveys of EV owners and drivers do not allow conclusions to be reached on market penetration of EVs, because the surveys do not include non-owners. That is, the sample is not representative of the vehicle purchasing population in California. Nevertheless such information provides important insights to manufacturers, regulators and future customers on  74   Staff Report August 7, 2000 the utility and viability of EVs in the ""real world"". Lessons learned with the EVs placed to satisfy MOA obligations can be used to better define the future EV marketplace by educating potential customers, identifying necessary technology improvements, and identifying desirable EV platforms. Various organizations, including the manufacturers, have surveyed the selected individuals or agencies that have received MOA EVs. ARB staff received testimony at the May 2000 workshop regarding a recent major statewide survey of EV drivers. Staff also received testimony at the March 2000 workshop regarding several Internet-based surveys of EV drivers. The results of these past surveys and surveys planned in the near term are briefly described here. March 2000 EV Owners Survey By the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) and Air Districts The Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC) was created by the California Legislature in 1990 to oversee programs, funded by a $4 motor vehicle registration fee, to reduce air pollution from mobile sources pursuant to the California Clean Air Act and the local Air Quality Management Plan. In March/April 2000, the MSRC and five air districts conducted a survey of electric vehicle owners. The focus of this comprehensive survey effort was to understand how EVs are being used in both retail and fleet applications. Results of the survey will lay the foundation for a statewide EV Education Program, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) through the California Energy Commission (CEC) and administered by the Clean Car Education Program (CCEP). For the past several years, five air districts partially funded by the CEC to provide EV incentives have been required to survey incentive recipients and report the results to the CEC on a biannual basis. The recent survey project took that activity one step further by looking at the results statewide, rather than district by district, and by evaluating the results along with those of other past surveys conducted on this subject. As the CCEP gets off the ground, it will be important to have a clear idea of who the first EV drivers are and the vehicle attributes that they most appreciate. This information will assist the CCEP in developing messages for the public concerning electric transportation.   A total of 294 surveys were received, which reported on 311 electric vehicles (an overall survey response rate of 49.5 percent, as compared to the response rate of 35 percent for a 1998 MSRC survey). Fifty-two percent of the vehicles were from the South Coast Air Basin (Orange County and non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties); 31 percent were from the Bay Area, while the remaining vehicles were from Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo counties. Fifty-eight percent of vehicles reported were EV1s.    75   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Surveys were distributed to fleet operators and retail consumers. Owners were requested to complete the survey on existing and previously owned electric vehicles. Therefore, owners whose vehicles have been recalled, or owners whose leases have expired, are also included in the responses. Sixty eight percent of the vehicles were 1998 or 1999 model year, twenty-two percent were 1996 or 1997 model year, and ten percent were 2000 model year or not specified. The annual average miles driven was 7,700. Specific findings reported by the MSRC include the following: Vehicle Usage.  Fourteen percent of respondents reported they drove their EV over 50 miles per day.  Ninety-one percent state that they use a freeway weekly if not daily; of the total, forty-two percent reported driving on the freeway on a daily basis. Only eight percent indicated that they never access freeways while driving their electric vehicle.  Seventy percent indicated that they use their EV as their primary vehicle, and of those, ninety-three percent have another vehicle available to them, but they prefer to drive the EV as their primary vehicle.  Owners use their electric vehicles in variety of ways: 68 percent for work or school commuting purposes, 64 percent for shopping and/or errands during the week, 55 percent for work-related purposes during the week, and 41 percent for weekend or recreational purposes.  Fifty-one percent of respondents (56 percent in the SCAB) indicated that they use public charging stations at least once a week. Forty-nine percent (67 percent in the SCAB) reported they drive their EV much more or somewhat more because public charging is available. Sixty-four percent (69 percent in the SCAB) reported that they did not have workplace charging but would use it if they did.  Table 7-3 shows that a large percentage of drivers use their EVs more than they thought they would prior to acquisition. Currently, seventy-four percent indicated that they drive their EV more than 75 percent of the time.  76   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Table 7- 3: Percentage of Driving in EV Expected, Prior to Ownership 10% 20% 15% 46% 9%  Proportion of Driving Less than 25% 26% to 50% 51% to 75% 76% to 100% No Response  Actual, After Ownership 7% 6% 7% 74% 6%  Owners' EV Experience.  Eighty-percent of those surveyed were more satisfied with their EV than with their current gasoline car.  Drivers indicated that overall they were extremely satisfied with their electric vehicles.  Features contributing to drivers' satisfaction include appearance and acceleration.  Drivers are only partially satisfied with vehicle driving range and heating system. (The MSRC survey description combines both range and heating system. Looking at the survey results for driving range, staff found that 74 percent of the drivers indicated that they were satisfied, very satisfied, or extremely satisfied with the range of the vehicle.)  Limited vehicle range, lack of public awareness and marketing are considered to be the most important reasons why the number of EV leases have not been greater.  Forty percent (55 percent in the SCAB) indicated that one time in four, drivers find a gasoline-powered vehicle parked in a public charging stall.  Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that incentives were a very important or somewhat important factor in influencing their decision to lease an EV.  Seventy-seven percent would lease another EV. EV Owner Demographics. EV owner demographics are very similar to those indicated in the 1998 MSRC survey, as well as other surveys conducted to monitor the use of electric vehicles throughout the state.  72 percent of the primary drivers were male and 18 percent were female. Nine percent of the respondents reported that both male and female members of their household were the primary driver, and one percent did not respond. The percentage of women drivers has increased since previous surveys. Forty-seven percent of EV drivers are 35-50 years old. The majority of respondents indicated they were employed as business (31 percent) or technical (23 percent) professionals. Ten percent were retired. Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported an annual income of less than $150,000.      77   Staff Report August 7, 2000 August 1998 Electric Vehicle Owner Survey by the MSRC In mid-1998, the MSRC distributed a survey to 284 EV Owners/Lessors who took advantage of the MSRC's buy-down incentive. 106 surveys were returned (36 percent response rate). The majority of the respondents were most likely retail customers, given that 77 percent of the surveys received were from drivers of the EV1. The average length of ownership was slightly more than 13 months, and the average annual mileage was about 8,100. The survey focused on characterizing the EV driver and EV use. 82 percent of the EV drivers were male. The EV was typically the primary car in a household with more than one vehicle. When asked why they leased their EV, the top three responses were (1) concern for the environment or a desire to do their part to help clean the air, (2) a desire to be one of the first to adopt an up and coming technology, and (3) a good fit between the EV's range and their commute patterns and habits. Based on the survey, the EVs appeared to meet a wide variety of transportation needs:     Commute to and from work or school (71 percent) Work/business purpose during the work day (63 percent) Shopping, errands during the week (88 percent) Family trips/outings, errands on the weekend (75 percent)  EV1 Drivers Club Survey Testimony was received at the March 2000 workshop regarding an online survey conducted via the EV1 Club Internet list. It was reported that about 130 persons took the survey with over 80 percent driving EV1s and the remainder driving the Honda EV Plus and Ford Rangers. Vehicle usage and owner experience were similar to that described above for the MSRC surveys. This survey additionally queried the drivers for their opinion on the importance of various factors affecting public acceptance of EVs. The majority of drivers reported that:       Public awareness, the cost of the EVs, range, and availability of EVs are extremely important or most important factors. The variety of EVs and lease-only placements were not important or somewhat important. The minimum guaranteed daily range to make an EV practical would be between 60 and 100 miles. Advertising and marketing of EVs by automakers has not been effective. The public has not been effectively educated regarding EVs. EVs have not been effectively made available to the public.  78   Staff Report August 7, 2000 EV Driver Testimonies on the Internet At the March 2000 workshop, staff received a package of more than 80 EV driver testimonials that had been collected from several Internet sites. These were primarily testimonials on the driver experience with leased or rented EV1s and the EV Pluses, but did include some for the Ford Ranger, conversions and even the Toyota Prius hybrid electric vehicle. The drivers were consistently pleased with vehicle performance, ease of driving and recharging, lower fuel and maintenance costs, and the minimal maintenance requirements. The drivers found vehicle range more than adequate for their typical daily needs, Many drivers hoped to retain the EVs after the current leases expire and expressed strong support for the ARB's ZEV requirements. Air Resources Board Internal User Survey The ARB Test Fleet, described further in Chapter 6.4.1, makes vehicles available to ARB employees for a period of two days up to a week. From July 1997 to August 1999, 245 employees made more than 2,800 trips with the test fleet. Two popular test fleet vehicles, a Honda EV Plus and a GM EV1, have been driven more than 25,000 miles and 20,000 miles, respectively. The employees were asked to complete a survey regarding their experience with each EV model. Analysis of 141 surveys returned by 99 employees indicates that the respondents typically had a positive to most positive overall experience driving the EVs. About 60 percent of the respondents indicated that they would consider leasing an EV for personal use. Some respondents identified several factors that they considered as impediments to leasing, including limited range, cost, and the inconvenience of charging. However, it should be noted that the test fleet user does not typically have access to a charger at home and must share access to chargers at work. To date, one staff person at ARB has successfully leased an OEM EV, a Ford Ranger; several staff own electric conversions. In recent months, the ZEV Implementation Section at ARB has had a noticeable increase in the number of inquires from ARB and other governmental agency staff regarding the availability of EVs to retail customers. This increased level of interest seems to coincide with publicity regarding new HOV access for EVs beginning July 1, 2000, and increased awareness of free EV parking at many public garages serving business and governmental centers. Awareness and interest in leasing EVs continue to build within the ARB and other state agencies. Office of Fleet Administration Daily Rental Electric Vehicle Survey The Department of General Services, Office of Fleet Administration operates several State garages that provide daily and long-term vehicle rentals to state agencies. Since July 1997, the State garage in Sacramento has offered free  79   Staff Report August 7, 2000 daily rental of the Honda EV Plus and the GM EV1. As of October 1999, more than 525 round trips, averaging 20 miles, have been made with a fleet of five EVs. The EV users were given the opportunity to complete a short survey on their EV driving experience. ARB staff analyzed 70 surveys turned in over a several month period in mid-1999. All of the respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the overall performance of the EV and that the driving range of the EV met their needs (for the rental). Almost 70 percent indicated that they would consider leasing or buying an EV. The most frequent comment received was that the EV was easy to drive and performed well. 10 of the 84 respondents also mentioned that the range was too limited for full-time use. Southern California Edison Fleet Experience and Municipal Fleet Survey SCE Fleet Experience. SCE staff testified at both workshops regarding the SCE's successful 12-year demonstration of a wide variety of EV models and prototypes. Overall EV penetration of the SCE's entire light duty fleet is more than 11 percent with some business units over 60 percent. By early 2000, more than 4.5 million miles had been placed on more than 420 EVs. SEC took a ""mission match"" approach to marketing and placing the EVs within their fleet. In a SCE questionnaire, 50 percent to 100 percent of the drivers responded that their EV was suited for their application and reliable, available 97 percent of the time. According to maintenance records, the highest incident repairs are related to tire replacements (49 percent), auxiliary systems (11 percent), batteries (10 percent), and charger (9 percent). SCE also found that operating an EV is less costly than operating a gasoline vehicle due to lower fueling costs and maintenance requirements. According to SCE staff, the process of expanding its EV fleet has had its challenges. SCE staff identify several areas of improvement necessary to allow EVs to reach their full potential, including the need for efficient and reliable EV ordering and delivery, standardized EV charging equipment, and availability of vehicle parts. Having found that EVs work successfully in their fleet applications, SCE staff plans to place an additional 200 EVs each year in the fleet, but are concerned with declining product availability. SCE Municipal Fleet Survey. In 1999, Southern California Edison surveyed a total of 63 municipal agencies, colleges and transit agencies regarding their experience with their EV fleets. These fleets had a total of 178 EVs including the Chevrolet S10, Ford Ranger, GM EV1, Honda EV Plus, and Toyota RAV4. These agencies also had 67 vehicles in the acquisition process. These vehicles are typically used for administrative, enforcement and inspection purposes or as pool/loaner vehicles. On a per vehicle basis, 84 percent of those surveyed were satisfied with the operation of the EV. Areas of dissatisfaction included reliability, range and seat/payload capacity. While 96 percent of the agencies were interested in expanding their EV fleets, the respondents cited cost (33 percent) and performance/range (53 percent) as barriers to greater EV use.  80   Staff Report August 7, 2000 EV Rental Cars Electric Vehicle Customer Satisfaction Survey EV Rental Cars, in conjunction with Budget Rent-a-Car, provides rentals of electric and alternative fuel vehicles at several locations in California including the Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ontario airports. EV Rental conducted phase one of an Electric Vehicle Customer Satisfaction Survey in May 2000. The sample in phase one consisted of 29 electric vehicle renters. The number of males surveyed outnumbered the women surveyed by 6 to 1, and most of the rentals were for business purposes. The overall experience of the electric vehicle renters was very positive. Of those surveyed, 93 percent were satisfied with the overall performance of the electric vehicle. Almost 80 percent said the vehicle's driving range met their needs and 76 percent said they would consider leasing or buying an electric vehicle. The customers indicated that they chose to rent the EV because driving it is better for the environment (41 percent), they were interested in the new technology of the EV, and the cost of the rental was less than expected (12 percent). EV Rental indicated that phase two of the survey will be available in mid-August 2000. May 2000 Electric Vehicle Fleet Managers Workshop Survey On May 23, 2000, Southern California Edison conducted an EV Fleet Managers Workshop, inviting more than one hundred representatives of municipal fleets, transit agencies, universities, and private businesses in the South Coast Air Basin. In response to an initial survey attached to registration materials, the fleet managers identified nine issue areas for discussion at the workshop including vehicle reliability, maintenance support, manufacturer support, operator and maintenance training, delivery delays, vehicle range, infrastructure, costs, and vehicle appropriateness. An expanded survey and evaluation form was developed and used at the workshop for roundtable discussions, moderator-led discussion, and written responses. The response rate was about 50 percent including follow-up telephone communications. Tabulated results and a summary of remarks are described in a report prepared by The Planning Center, ""EV Fleet Issues: Perspectives of Fleet Managers"". The report concludes that non-availability is the largest concern of EV fleet managers, and that this issue is critical to continuing EV market growth and overshadows the other concerns of reliability, maintenance support and limited range. The report further concludes that the future of the EV market is still very dependent upon government mandates and incentive programs, and that continued financial support for the incremental cost of vehicles and expansion of the EV infrastructure is needed. 7.2.4 Marketing Issues This section touches on various issues that have arisen in the course of the initial EV market demonstration programs.  81   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Vehicle Availability. Many speakers at the workshops testified that although they are interested in leasing an EV, they have been unable to do so because vehicles are not currently available. For example, drivers who lost the use of an EV1 due to the General Motors recall, and who wish to replace the EV1 with another electric vehicle, have in most cases been unable to do so. A fleet manager for a major utility testified that he anticipated having difficulty meeting his desired lease level of about 200 EVs annually, and another fleet manager reported similar problems. Staff has received public comment documenting that fleet managers for at least 14 other private and public fleets would like to lease a total of more than 40 vehicles, but cannot due to lack of availability. The affected fleets include at a minimum the following:               City of West Covina City of Burbank City of San Francisco City of Santa Rosa City of Newport Beach City of Huntington Beach City of Pasadena Xpress Shuttle VTA Novell Anaheim Anaheim Transportation Network Los Angeles Department of Water and Power City of West Hollywood  ARB staff has experienced this problem first-hand, in that ARB has been unable to obtain the desired number of vehicles for the EV Sacramento and EV Loan programs, which place EVs with government agencies. This lack of availability of electric vehicles is due to the decision by most manufacturers to curtail production after placing the vehicles required for their MOA demonstration programs. Toyota and Ford are still taking orders to be filled next year, with one experiencing production delay because of a component supply problem. The MOAs were originally intended to provide a ramp-up to 2003. In retrospect, it appears that the combination of the MOAs and the existing level of multiple credits offered for early introduction have not been sufficient to encourage significant vehicle production in 2000 though 2003. Lease Process Difficulties. Staff has received testimony and written submittals from individuals indicating that in their view they had to overcome unusual barriers in order to lease an EV. Examples included sales staff who are unfamiliar with the vehicles, long delays in getting information, ambiguous or contradictory information regarding ""waiting lists"" to obtain vehicles, and long 82   Staff Report August 7, 2000 delays in getting vehicles once orders had been placed. Some EV drivers also stated they have more recently stopped encouraging potential customers to visit EV dealers, because test drive opportunities are difficult to arrange and the dealers are uncertain regarding when EVs would be available. Regarding delays, Ford testified that some of its delays in vehicle availability were due to quality control issues and supplier problems, which occur on conventional vehicles as well. Manufacturers also stated that the only additional barriers or delays specific to acquiring an EV are attributable to issues regarding the proper installation of home recharging sites. Charger installation involves an initial inspection of the site, contractor installation, and local agency inspection to ensure all aspects are safe and meet local code requirements. 7.2.5 Applicability to 2003 All major manufacturers have placed vehicles in response to the MOAs between the automakers and the ARB. Under the MOAs, the automakers committed to participate in an advanced technology battery demonstration project. Each automaker agreed to produce their pro-rata share of approximately 1,800 advanced battery vehicles between 1998 and 2000. In addition to the MOA vehicles, several manufacturers have also offered vehicles on a voluntary basis, separate from the MOA requirement. Such vehicles include the lead acid versions of the Chevrolet S-10, Gm EV1, Ford Ranger, and Chrysler EPIC, as well as the NiMH Toyota RAV4 EV. Although manufacturers have devoted great effort to these placements, as described elsewhere in this section, ARB staff believes that the marketing of electric vehicles to date has differed from a normal market in several significant respects:  Only two manufacturers, GM and Honda, offered their vehicles to retail customers with broad-based marketing efforts. The remaining manufacturers marketed only to fleets, using a marketing approach appropriate for fleet sales. Although a variety of vehicle platforms was produced, none of the manufacturers chose to develop a five passenger four door sedan. Manufacturers used a variety of approaches to sell, distribute and service the vehicles, but no manufacturer marketed its vehicles at all dealerships. Due to the new technology employed, EVs imposed unusual information and training demands on all involved parties--customers, dealership staff, infrastructure providers, and marketing staff. Manufacturer pricing strategies were intended to gather information about customer demand, but were not set in a competitive fashion based on prices of otherwise equivalent conventional vehicles. Most vehicles were available for lease only rather than for purchase, and some leases included low mileage caps of 10,000 miles per year..        83   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Staff recognizes that there were valid reasons for all of these choices. For example, range, cost and packaging trade-offs entered into the choice of vehicle platforms, and low volume vehicles are often made available through only a limited number of dealerships in recognition of the training and expertise necessary to support unique vehicles. Staff is not criticizing the approaches that were taken, but rather pointing out that in some respects they were not typical of mainstream vehicle marketing. Manufacturers have stated that it was difficult to place the relatively small number of MOA vehicles. The manufacturers then go on to conclude that based on their MOA experience it will be almost impossible to meet the 2003 requirement. They argue that fundamental EV marketing difficulties associated with battery technology, cost, vehicle range and customer preferences will not change in any significant respect between now and 2003. Staff believes, however, that the results of the MOA marketing efforts, with vehicles priced well above similar conventional vehicles, do not necessarily indicate that a broad based approach from all manufacturers, with competitive pricing, could not succeed. When Ford reduced its price on the EV Ranger, for example, the available vehicles were quickly placed. In summary, the MOA marketing efforts provide an opportunity to begin to understand the factors involved in advertising, selling and supporting electric vehicles. Lessons have been learned which will be of value in future efforts. The MOA experience does not, however, lead to definitive conclusions about the prospects for 2003. 7.3 The 2003 Market  This section reviews available information that will assist in assessing the potential market for EVs in 2003 and beyond. It addresses customer awareness, studies of market demand, and possible applications well suited to the use of EVs. 7.3.1 Customer Awareness Testimony at the March and May workshops addressed the general point that it has been difficult for the public to get information regarding available electric vehicles and their characteristics. Drivers testified that their neighbors, friends and interested persons on the street do not know that production EVs are available to ""regular people."" These EV drivers expressed concern with the adequacy of manufacturer marketing efforts and government agency educational programs. In their public comments, automakers pointed out the aggressive measures that they have taken to provide information regarding their electric  84   Staff Report August 7, 2000 vehicles, including websites, television and newspaper advertisements, and tollfree telephone lines. The level of public awareness was addressed in a more systematic way in recent research on EV Market awareness conducted by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). To determine the extent of target-market awareness of available light-duty, highway-legal EV products, PG&E surveyed a random sample of its residential customers. For seven consecutive weeks beginning on March 28, 2000, surveys were mailed each week to 450 residential customers. Of the 3,150 surveys mailed, 737 were completed by June 9, 2000 (23 percent response rate). PG&E assumed that the EV manufacturers are targeting California residents who are 2554 years old with at least some college education. EV marketing effectiveness was evaluated for this subset of respondents. Data on income were not collected. The survey consisted primarily of questions about customer satisfaction with Pacific Gas and Electric Company's service, but included two EV and three demographic questions. Introductory text immediately prior to the EV questions provided background. Awareness of available EV products was measured with multiple-choice questions: ""Which, if any, companies do you think are selling or leasing EVs today in California? (Please check all that apply)"" and ""Which, if any, types of electric vehicles do you think are being sold or leased today in California? (Please check all that apply)."" Survey respondents were deemed to be aware of EV products if they checked a correct combination of EV company and type. EVs have primarily been promoted in marketing campaigns by EV manufacturers. Incentive programs by government agencies and education efforts by EV industry organizations, environmental advocacy groups, and electric utilities complement the automaker marketing campaigns. Despite these EV marketing activities, in Northern and Central California awareness of available light-duty, highway-legal EVs is low. Only 7 percent of the target group (2554 year old, college-educated) in Northern and Central California are aware of at least one of several EV products. In the San Francisco Bay Area only 9 percent of this group in are aware of at least one EV product. The researchers concluded that before EV range, operation and maintenance, and user satisfaction become important considerations to the consumer, the market must become aware of the product's existence. With so few people aware of available products, it is premature to make conclusions about the sufficiency of EV market demand. 7.3.2 EV Market Studies Testimony was received at the May 2000 workshop regarding several market studies that have been sponsored by automakers or other interested parties.  85   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Brief descriptions of the market studies are provided below. It should be noted that the studies are in progress or preliminary and have not been reviewed by ARB staff. National Economic Research Associates Toyota and General Motors recently sponsored a study of customer choices among internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles. The study was conducted by a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and National Economic Research Associates, Inc. (NERA). The study's objectives were to determine how customers value electric vehicles relative to internal combustion engine vehicles and the impact of additional information on customers' valuations. According to workshop testimony, this study was conducted over the telephone with materials mailed in advance; respondents were not given the opportunity to test drive an EV. A sample of over a thousand recent new car buyers (cars purchased within the last three years) were given choice situations that varied vehicle attributes including vehicle type, engine type, purchase price, operating cost, performance and range. The respondents were split into basic and enhanced information level groups; the enhanced group was provided an air quality write-up and an article on EVs and ICEVs. The researcher used a mixed logit method to evaluate the response as varying vehicle attributes. The study found a low demand for EVs because customers place a large negative valuation on EVs for reasons other than their price, performance, and operating costs. The study estimated that customers would require a $28,000 price differential in order for 50 percent of customers to choose the electric RAV4. Describing the impact of the negative valuation, the researcher indicated that since the average retail transaction price of an internal combustion engine Toyota RAV4 is about $21,000, this would mean that the average consumer would not accept a RAV4 EV if it were offered for free. According to the study, this is due to shortcomings that are characteristic of EVs, such as limited range. The researcher also indicated the negative valuation is still significantly strong even when consumers are informed about the potential positive effect of EVs on California air quality. In staff's view, the reported finding that a typical customer would not accept a free RAV4 EV is counterintuitive to say the least. With a waiting list for ZEVs at lease rates of $450 per month or more, clearly many customers would be happy to get a free RAV4 EV. We also have numerous questions regarding the study methodology. Toyota and GM plan to provide staff with a copy of the report and a briefing by the researchers but this information has not been received in time to be included in this Staff Report.  86   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Green Car Institute Market Research The Green Car Institute is an independent, nonprofit agency created to further the acceptance and adoption of low emission and clean fuel vehicles by American motorists. Green Car Institute is engaging in a study to investigate the current and future market for electric vehicles, taking into account the state's experience up to now and likely experience in light of the mandate for 2003. In preliminary market research, Green Car Institute found that a variety of barriers have combined with the nature of the MOA demonstration projects to limit penetration of electric vehicles during the past several years:      Fleet buyers are confronted with a different purchase process for EVs. Fleet availability and suitability of EVs is not marketed consistently. Private buyers are also confused and misled by EV marketing. Private buyers also encounter a more difficult buying process. Manufacturers' strategies may have been shaped more by the desire for quick fulfillment of MOA requirements than by long-term establishment of an EV market.  The Green Car Institute study will use standard automotive market research techniques to estimate the magnitude of the current and potential future markets for EVs. The variables will include current and future EVs with a variety of ranges, lease/sale prices and other attributes. Green Car Institute expects to be able to extrapolate the potential EV market and compare that with placement numbers required by the ZEV regulation. The study is expected to be completed prior to the September Board meeting. 7.3.3 Potential Market Applications To attempt to provide useful information regarding the possible market in 2003, staff has investigated several applications that lend themselves well to being served by electric vehicles. For this exercise we assume that the vehicle price would be roughly equivalent to similar conventional vehicles on a lifecycle cost basis. Manufacturers have argued that the price of EVs will need to be less than that of similar conventional vehicles, due to the limitations on EV driving range and recharge time. Ford commented that based on customer response to several different prices set for the Ranger EV, in order to meet a 4 percent mandate volume, Ford would have to set the price of the Ranger EV well below $200 per month. The $200 per month lease price corresponds to a manufacturers' suggested retail price (MSRP) of less than $10,000, as compared to the $14,000 MSRP of the conventional Ranger. We recognize that at least in the initial years such pricing would not recover the cost of the vehicle. Consideration clearly must be given to how any additional  87   Staff Report August 7, 2000 costs would be borne. For our purposes here, however, we are investigating whether applications exist that could make use of the required number of vehicles, without regard to cost. Fleet Vehicles. Fleet sales include commercial, rental and governmental fleets. EVs are well suited to meet a variety of fleet applications. Fleet vehicles typically have well defined and consistent driving patterns and range requirements, and are centrally refueled. Data from Automotive Fleet Magazine indicate that on a national basis, fleet sales make up about 20 percent of passenger car sales and 12 percent of truck sales. Fleet sales are 16 percent of the combined (cars plus trucks) total. Given California annual light duty vehicle sales of roughly 1,000,000 per year, a 16 percent sales fraction corresponds to a fleet market of about 160,000 vehicles per year. (Please note that this is a revised estimate as compared to the Preliminary Draft Staff Report, based on new information). Thus a 10 percent penetration of the fleet market, or 16,000 vehicles per year, would in and of itself almost be sufficient to meet our estimated ""base case"" four percent ZEV placement requirement. Staff has attempted to gather more specific information as to the number of fleet vehicles purchased per year in California by various fleet operators. Information on such purchases is scattered, and to date staff has been unable to obtain precise estimates. The following represents the best available information available at this point. Automotive Fleet Magazine data, again at the national level, indicate that governmental fleets make up 7 percent of passenger fleet sales, 12 percent of truck fleet sales, or 9 percent of total fleet sales. Using the 160,000 vehicle annual California fleet sales estimate noted above, 9 percent of that total is 14,400 vehicles per year. Excluding special purpose vehicles such as those used by the California Highway Patrol, the State of California purchases roughly 1,500 passenger cars and light duty trucks per year. Based on 1991 survey results reported by the California Energy Commission, staff estimates that local governments (cities and counties) purchase roughly 14,000 light duty vehicles per year. This total does not include special purpose vehicles such as police cars. Taken together these state and local government fleet sales total more than 15,000 vehicles per year. This estimate is in general agreement with the 14,400 figure for governmental fleet sales derived above. If electric vehicles could serve one fourth of these governmental applications, it would result in a market of about 3,750 vehicles per year just for state and local public fleets.  88   Staff Report August 7, 2000 Utility companies represent another ideal market. A representative of Southern California Edison testified at the March 2000 workshop that EVs already constitute more than 11 percent of their total light duty vehicle fleet, and more than 60 percent of some business units. SCE plans plan to add 200 vehicles per year. Staff estimates that by 2003 utility companies statewide could readily absorb 1,000 vehicles per year. The federal government vehicle fleet and other large institutional fleets such as the US Postal Service also could readily use EVs. Staff does not have quantitative information at this point, but notes that it is reasonable to assume that other fleets could make use of EVs in a manner similar to utilities and governmental fleets. Commuter Vehicles/Second Cars. To attempt to quantify the number of households that could reasonably be expected to use an EV for commuting purposes, staff has adapted a methodology used by auto manufacturers. The elements of the calculation are as follows: Number of owner-occupied households in California with two cars and garage Percentage of above with annual household income greater than $75,000 Result Percentage of above with round trip commute of 40 miles or less Result Percentage of above that purchase a vehicle in a given year Result 3,800,000  x 17%  646,000 x 68%  439,280 x 20% 87,856  These assumptions are deliberately somewhat conservative. For example, households with annual income below $75,000 certainly purchase cars, and some fraction of them could be attracted to an EV. Even so, this calculation results in a target population of almost 88,000 households. If 5 percent of these households chose to lease an electric vehicle for commuting or second car purposes, it would result in a market of about 4,400 vehicles per year.  89   Staff Report August 7, 2000 City Electric Vehicles. Ford Motor Company, through its Th!nk subsidiary, plans to market the Th!nk City vehicle beginning in 2001. The market for City Electric Vehicles is promising but largely unexplored. Low Speed Vehicles. As discussed in Section 4 above, low speed vehicles are not passenger cars under federal law and do not need to meet the same Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These vehicles do, however, qualify for ZEV credit. The market for low speed vehicles in California also is unexplored at this point. Proponents have noted that there are large numbers of retirement communities, universities, business campuses, gated communities and other developments that provide a potential niche for this type of vehicle. Summary As the technology has advanced and vehicle makers have adapted to current circumstances, it appears that a wide range of vehicle types will be available in 2003. Staff has described various applications that lend themselves to being served by EVs. Staff acknowledges that the assumptions underlying these estimates may be deemed overly conservative or overly optimistic depending on one's point of view. Manufacturers have commented that ""potential applications"" are not the same as ""market demand"". Manufacturers also stated in public comments that the staff estimate of potential market is not well supported by data. Staff recognizes that placement of the required number of vehicles in the possible applications noted above will be difficult, because customers have many attractive choices available that do not have the range, recharge time, and cost limitations associated with today's battery electric vehicles. Staff does not agree, however, that market demand is non-existent for competitively priced ZEVs. 7.4 Elements Needed for a Successful EV Market  This section outlines several elements that will be essential in order for the EV market to progress. Before listing these marketing needs, however, it is necessary to understand some of the unique attributes of the EV market that need to be taken into account.  90   Staff Report August 7, 2000 7.4.1 Attributes of the EV Market Real vs. Perceived Range Needs. Many drivers remarked that when they first considered an EV, they had an estimate in mind regarding the portion of their driving that could be accommodated within the available range. After living with the vehicle, however, they learned that their actual driving patterns were less demanding than they had imagined, and therefore they were able to use the EV far more than they had anticipated. Drivers noted that this ""mismatch"" between perceived and actual range needs is an artificial barrier to more widespread demand for EVs. Public information would help in getting customers beyond this perceived barrier. SCE has developed an innovative electronic mapping tool known as the Trip Planner to help address range concerns within its own fleet applications. The software allows local fleet users to map their daily routes and confirm that they are within the range of an EV. The trip planner has been very effective in breaking down internal employee reservations about EV use. Districts that were reluctant to use EVs used the trip planner to analyze their trips and routes, and are now successfully using EVs. Consumer Decisionmaking Regarding Lifecycle Cost. EVs will have a higher up-front cost, offset by savings over time in fuel cost and maintenance. Consumers generally have shown, however, that they value up front savings more than savings achieved over time, even if from an economic standpoint the alternatives are of equal cost. For example, consumers do not always favor energy-saving improvements that clearly will pay for themselves over time. This behavior, although ""irrational"" in an economic sense, is real and must be addressed in order to achieve the full EV market potential. Driving the Vehicle Increases Its Appeal. Many members of the general public have preconceived notions regarding EVs-they are considered ""golf carts"" with limited driving appeal. At the March workshop drivers testified that once they had an opportunity to drive an EV, they were ""sold"". The customer satisfaction attributes noted above (smoothness, quiet, performance, fun to drive) can only be experienced in person. Staff has noted a similar phenomenon in the operation of the EV loan program. Once fleet users have had an opportunity to drive the vehicle their acceptance of its possible application to their fleet is enhanced. Public Perception of Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Many members of the public also have inaccurate perceptions of the relative environmental attributes of EVs and hybrid electric vehicles. Staff has noted that  91   Staff Report August 7, 2000 in most cases the public assumes that hybrid electric vehicles are as clean as EVs. They thus conclude that hybrids have more appeal because they are just as clean but offer unlimited range and do not need to be recharged. In fact, although the efficiency of hybrid electric vehicles offers CO2 advantages when compared to a standard vehicle, today's hybrids can emit more smog forming pollutants than the most advanced conventional vehicles, let alone EVs. For example, the Honda Insight is certified to the ULEV level, while Honda sells an Accord that is certified to the SULEV level. The Toyota Prius is certified as a SULEV. Many factors go into the choice of a vehicle, and staff does not mean to imply that purchasers of HEVs would instead all opt for EVs if they fully understood the relative environmental attributes of the various vehicles. A better public understanding of these points would, however, increase the relative appeal of EVs to those customers for whom ""green car"" attributes are important. Risk of New Technology. EVs feature cutting-edge technology. For some customers, this is a positive benefit. The manufacturer marketing strategies noted above recognized that ""early adopters"" and ""techno champs"" would be favorably disposed towards EVs for that reason. For other customers, however, the introduction of new technology is cause for hesitation. Such customers, who ultimately may be well suited to using EVs, will need additional information and consultation. Manufacturers have tried to address this issue through lease packages that offer unlimited free maintenance and remove all risk from the consumer. Additionally, successive market years of experience will increase the acceptance of EVs as they pass their first years as a new technology. Those who avoid driving cars in the first model year of a new design will more readily consider EVs as their history on the market grows. This may help e"
GX232-45-3383165	"Can I get a tax credit for my HEV? YES. The Colorado alternative fuel vehicle credit can be claimed for the three currently available hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs):  Honda Civic Hybrid  Honda Insight  Toyota Prius Business and personal vehicles currently qualify for the credit. However, for most individuals, a personal HEV had to be purchased in 2001 or later to qualify. HEVs purchased before 2001 had to be used for business purposes to qualify (HEVs used for business part-time before 2001 may receive a prorated credit). Leased HEVs are eligible for the credit. This Colorado tax credit is also available for vehicles that run on alternative fuels. For more information see Colorado Department of Revenue FYI Income 9: Alternative Fuel Income Tax Credits www.revenue.state.co.us/fyi/html/ income09.html.  Where on my tax form do I put the HEV credit? On the 2002 Colorado Department of Revenue Form 104, the credit is listed on line 20. It is calculated on line 5(c) of Form 104CR, the individual credit schedule.  What if I lease my HEV? Only the lessor (the person who leases the HEV to another person) or the lessee (the person to whom the HEV is leased) can claim the credit for a leased HEV. The lessor may either claim the credit or pass the right to claim the credit to the lessee. For details on how to calculate the credit for a leased vehicle, see Colorado Department of Revenue FYI Income 9: Alternative Fuel Income Tax Credits www.revenue.state.co.us/fyi/html/income09.html.  What other requirements are there for claiming the credit? Qualifying vehicles must be titled and registered in Colorado. A vehicle can qualify for the credit only once. If the allowable credit exceeds your state tax liability, you may carry the excess forward for as long as five years.  How much credit do I get for my HEV? The Colorado Department of Revenue provides the exact amount of the credit for each HEV: HEV 2002 Toyota Prius 2003 Toyota Prius 2002 Honda Insight 2003 Honda Insight (automatic) 2003 Honda Insight (manual) 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid TAX CREDIT $3,929 $3,070 $3,375 $3,120 $2,603 $1,815  What if I bought my car before this year? You may file an amended tax return to claim the deduction for the tax year in which you purchased the vehicle. If you purchased the vehicle before 2001 it must have been used for business purposes. Business and personal vehicles purchased in 2001 or later are eligible.  Will future HEVs be eligible for a Colorado tax credit? Probably. The amount will depend on the incremental cost of the vehicle.  Credit for HEVs released in model year 2004 or later will be posted on the Colorado Department of Revenue's Frequently Asked Questions Web page (http://revenuestateco.custhelp. com/cgi-bin/revenuestateco.cfg/php/enduser/home.php). The amounts in the above table are based on the HEV's incremental cost, its emission certification level, and the tax year.  My HEV is used for a state government or tax-exempt organization-- does it qualify for an incentive? An HEV qualifies for a rebate instead of a credit if it is owned by the State of Colorado, a political subdivision of the state, or a tax-exempt organization and is used for official activities. The rebate is for the same amount as the credit would be. Qualified entities are limited to $350,000 per state fiscal year in total rebates paid. To apply for the rebate, use Colorado Department of Revenue Forms DR 0166, DR 0167, and DR 0168.  Where can I find more information?

GX255-75-14418190	"State of California California Environmental Protection Agency AIR RESOURCES BOARD  REVISED PRELIMINARY STAFF ASSESSMENT  MARCH 29 WORKSHOP ZEV 2000 BIENNIAL REVIEW  This document has been reviewed by the staff of the California Air Resources Board. Publication does not signify that the contents necessarily reflect the views and policies of the Air Resources Board.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Air Resources Board's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program was adopted in 1990, as part of the first Low-Emission Vehicle regulations. program is an integral part of California's mobile source control efforts, intended to create a market for advanced technologies that will secure air quality benefits for California now and into the future. originally The ZEV and is maximum  Continued reliance on today's technology will not allow California to reach its health-based air quality goals. In ARB's vision of the future, therefore, the vehicle fleet will produce zero tailpipe emissions, and will use fuels with minimal ""fuel cycle"" emissions (emissions that occur due to vehicle refueling and the related production or transportation of fuel). Among the auto manufacturers, there is a general consensus that global customer demands will reward companies that can meet society's transportation needs while eliminating harmful environmental impacts. Thus, although there may be disagreements over the pace of change and the path to be followed, the ultimate goal is not in question. Pure zero-emission vehicles hold distinct air quality advantages over technologies that use a conventional fuel such as gasoline in a combustion engine. Vehicles with combustion engines inevitably exhibit deterioration that results in increased emission levels as the vehicle ages. They are also subject to becoming gross polluters if critical emission control systems fail. High volatility liquid fuels such as gasoline are responsible for significant fuel cycle emissions. For all of these reasons, vehicles with no potential to produce emissions are the ""gold standard"" of even the cleanest, most advanced new technologies. When the ZEV requirement was adopted in 1990, low- and zero-emission vehicle technology was in a very early stage of development. The Board acknowledged that many issues would need to be addressed throughout the program's implementation. Thus the Board directed staff to provide an update on the ZEV program on a biennial basis, in order to provide a context for the necessary policy discussion and deliberation. The next biennial review of the ZEV program is scheduled for September 2000. In preparing for the Board's upcoming Biennial Review, the goal of the staff is to provide a thorough, accurate portrayal of the current status of ZEV technology and the prospects for improvement in the near- and long-term. Extensive staff work is underway in a variety of areas. This document outlines the information developed to date, and describes other efforts underway that will provide additional information as the review proceeds. In particular, the battery technology, cost, emission benefit, and EV market sections of this document will be significantly expanded and revised when ongoing work is completed. Thus a complete assessment of the full range of relevant issues will be first presented in the next iteration of this document, in time for a workshop in May.   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised The purpose of this document is to put forth technical information for public review and comment, develop a framework and context for consideration of the relevant issues, and provide an opportunity for interested parties to point out errors, omissions, or other problems in the factual basis that will be made available to the Board. Comments are welcome on all aspects of this material. Manufacturer Status The ZEV requirement applies to large and intermediate volume manufacturers. Beginning in model year (MY) 2003, at least 10 percent of the passenger cars and light duty trucks produced and delivered for sale in California by large and intermediate volume manufacturers must be ZEVs. An intermediate volume manufacturer may meet this ZEV requirement entirely with partial ZEV allowance vehicles. A large volume manufacturer must meet at least 40 percent of its ZEV requirement with pure ZEVs or full ZEV allowance vehicles. Large volume manufacturers may, at their option, meet the remaining 60 percent of their ZEV requirement with partial ZEV allowance vehicles. Because MY (model year) 2003 is quickly approaching and planning for MY 2003 production has already begun, ARB staff has attempted to establish each manufacturer's volume classification and, thus, each manufacturer's ZEV requirement. Based on current production and sales data, ARB staff expects the small volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be Porsche, Saab, GFI, Ferrari, Dae Woo Motor Company, Rolls Royce, Suzuki, Lamborghini and Lotus. Based on the same data, ARB staff expects the intermediate volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be BMW, Subaru (Fuji), Hyundai, Isuzu, Jaguar, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Rover, Volkswagen and Volvo. ARB staff expects the large manufacturers in MY 2003 to be DaimlerChrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. In recent years there have been many new multi-manufacturer arrangements, which have made it difficult to delineate individual companies. To clarify the ZEV-related emission compliance liabilities of companies in multi-manufacturer arrangements, ARB staff will hold a workshop on March 30, 2000. In rough terms, each one percent of California light-duty vehicle sales equals about ten thousand vehicles per year. The calculation of the actual number of vehicles needed to meet the ZEV requirement in any given year, however, is considerably more complex. To provide a context for the Board's evaluation of the ZEV program, staff have developed a ""base case"" estimate of the number of ZEVs that the major manufacturers must produce in 2003 in order to satisfy a four percent ZEV requirement. Due to trade secret considerations, this estimate does not rely on any confidential information provided in the manufacturer product plans. Assuming that the vehicles used to meet the requirement have the same range as the vehicles available today, staff estimates that roughly 22,000 zero emission vehicles would need to be produced in 2003. This corresponds to about 2.3 percent of the passenger car and light duty truck  ii   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised production of the affected manufacturers. It must be noted, however, that actual 2003 ZEV production may vary significantly from this number. All manufacturers have indicated that they have the technical capability to produce the quantity of vehicles needed to meet their 2003 obligation. The manufacturers uniformly argued, however, that the cost of these vehicles remains high, and foreseeable battery technology will result in limitations on vehicle range. Thus in their view it will be difficult to develop a self-sustaining mass market for battery electric vehicles at this time. Staff notes that technical advances are steadily reducing the cost premium associated with ZEVs and that increased production volume will bring about further reductions. Because the status of battery technology is central to any discussion of cost and feasibility, such issues will be addressed more completely in the next iteration of this document, following the receipt of a report from a panel of outside experts that is reviewing battery cost and performance. Compliance with the Memoranda of Agreement In 1996, the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board and all major auto manufacturers signed Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs). The MOAs are intended to ensure the successful introduction of zero emission vehicles into the marketplace. They include numerous binding commitments from each of the auto manufacturers as well as from ARB. Staff concludes that the manufacturers and the ARB have met their current commitments in the MOAs. As part of the state's efforts, the ARB and the Department of General Services have undertaken a number of activities designed to facilitate leasing of ZEVs. Such efforts include the EV Loan Program, the EV Sacramento Program, the EV Rental Demonstration Program, the EV Long Term Placement Program, and outreach by the Office of Fleet Administration. Vehicle Technology Assessment In June 1999, ARB began meeting with auto manufacturers to discuss their obligations and plans for meeting the ZEV requirement in MY 2003. In December 1999 and February 2000, ARB staff visited all the large volume manufacturers in Japan and in the United States to examine, first hand, the progress each manufacturer is making in preparing to meet the ZEV requirement. From the inception of the ZEV program, the battery electric vehicle has been the leading candidate for meeting the ZEV percentage requirements due to its stage of commercial development. Since 1990, worldwide effort in the research and development of vehicle and battery technology has greatly improved the prospects for the successful commercialization of electric vehicles. More recently, fuel cell technology has gained worldwide attention as a technology capable of supplanting current internal combustion engine vehicles in the market while providing zero direct emissions (when using stored hydrogen). iii   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised In 1998 the ARB modified the ZEV requirement to allow ZEV credit to be earned by vehicles with near-zero emissions, referred to as ""partial ZEVs"" (PZEVs). Staff believes that this partial allowance approach towards satisfying the ZEV requirement will promote the continued development of battery-powered electric and zero-emitting fuel cell vehicles, while encouraging the development of other advanced technology vehicles that have the potential for producing extremely low emissions. At the present time, only the Nissan Sentra `CA' (""Clean Air"") has achieved California certification for PZEV credit. Several other vehicles have achieved SULEV-level exhaust emissions, but have not yet demonstrated compliance with the full set of PZEV requirements. Great progress has also been made on the development of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles. Based on public announcements to date, however, staff does not believe that grid-charged hybrid-electric capability will be made available on any MY 2000-2003 vehicles. Several classes of small on-road electric vehicles have begun to emerge in the last few years that will displace gasoline vehicle usage and increase overall zeroemission miles traveled within California. Examples of such vehicles include low speed vehicles (LSVs), neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and city electric vehicles (City EVs). These vehicles are under consideration because they offer a number of desirable characteristics, including very high efficiency, affordability, the potential for reduced congestion, and many niche market applications. Under current state law and ARB regulation, NEV/LSVs and City EVs all qualify as ""passenger cars"" and therefore are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. In terms of trip replacement and the resulting air quality impact, however, these vehicles differ, and are not the complete equivalent of full-range EVs. Therefore it is not clear that they should all be treated the same. ARB staff plan to evaluate the relative emissions benefit of the various categories of vehicles. Battery Technology Assessment The cost of batteries, both today and when produced in volume, is one of the most critical parameters of this review. To obtain the best available assessment, the ARB has contracted with a team of outside experts. This panel is in the process of meeting with leading battery suppliers and auto manufacturers. Their task is to review the state of the art regarding advanced battery design and manufacturing techniques, and report back to staff regarding likely cost trends for 2003 and beyond. Their draft final report will be presented at the May workshop. The current structure of the ARB regulatory and incentive scheme for ZEVs and partial ZEVs is intended to encourage the development of advanced batteries that will allow battery EVs to achieve extended range. This approach has been taken in order to encourage the development of vehicles with sufficient range to cover the majority of trips taken by typical drivers. Some parties have argued that the ARB preference for advanced batteries should be revisited. Proponents of this view make the case that the most cost-effective application for battery EVs could be vehicles powered by lead acid batteries, and they question whether the  iv   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised increased range afforded by advanced batteries justifies the extra cost. Others have argued that one appropriate niche for battery EVs could be smaller, shorterrange vehicles for urban and commuter use. Infrastructure Assessment To achieve zero and near-zero emission levels, together with minimal upstream refueling emissions, the advanced technology vehicles being developed by manufacturers often require the use of a ""fuel"" other than conventional gasoline. Therefore it will be critical to ensure that the necessary refueling infrastructure is in place to support their widespread introduction. For electric vehicles the refueling infrastructure consists of charging stations. The public infrastructure for electric vehicle charging continues to expand in California. Currently, inductive electric charging stations and conductive electric charging stations are available at about 300 and 200 public locations, respectively. To address fuel cell vehicle and infrastructure issues, in April 1999 California Governor Gray Davis and industry leaders announced the ""California Fuel Cell Partnership - Driving the Future"". The partnership is a collaboration of auto manufacturers, energy providers, a fuel cell company, the State of California, and the United States Department of Energy. In addition to testing fuel cell vehicles, the Partnership will also identify fuel infrastructure issues and prepare the California market for this new technology. A key goal of the Partnership is to determine the best fuel infrastructure for the market entry of fuel cell vehicles. The EV Market The EV driver experience provides important information to manufacturers, regulators and future customers on the utility and viability of EVs in the ""real world"". Lessons learned with the EVs placed to satisfy MOA obligations can be used to better define the future EV market place by educating potential customers, identifying necessary technology improvements, and identifying desirable EV platforms. According to information submitted by the manufacturers, they have sponsored focus groups studies, market analyses, and mass surveys to identify potential EV customers. ARB staff is currently reviewing this material and will provide general descriptions of the results obtained from these various efforts in the next draft of this document.  v   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Cost Information Automakers have had many years to refine and reduce costs for the manufacture of internal combustion engines. Electric drive vehicles are just at the beginning of the cost reduction cycle. After reviewing several cost models and research, ARB staff projects that the initial cost of battery electric vehicles in high-volume production will be higher than that of a conventional vehicle even under the most favorable conditions. This is due to the high cost of the battery pack that overwhelms the possibly slightly lower cost of the rest of the vehicle (in comparison to the conventional vehicle). A more detailed assessment will be provided following the submittal of the report of the external battery panel, and will be available for review and comment at the May workshop. Cost is also the major issue facing the development of fuel cell vehicles. While these systems are currently extremely expensive, efforts are ongoing to meet stringent cost goals for every material, component and manufacturing process. Ultimately, the use of automated manufacturing will be necessary for all components and subsystems if these stringent cost goals are to be met. To date, automakers have not yet encountered any fundamental barriers to meeting these cost goals. Although Partial ZEV vehicles at present also face a cost penalty, that penalty is less significant and is expected to be further reduced as production levels are increased. Hybrid vehicles, with two propulsion systems, will be more expensive to produce than PZEV certified conventional ICE vehicles. Due to their increased efficiency, hybrid vehicles will recover at least a portion of this cost penalty via reduced fuel cost, as will battery EVs and fuel cell vehicles. Emission Benefit Information This staff assessment provides preliminary information on per-vehicle emissions from battery electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles vs. conventional vehicles. The Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission currently have staff analyses and contract studies underway that will update and refine these estimates. These comparisons do not at present include ""upstream"" emissions from conventional vehicles due to fuel production and transfer, and vehicle refueling. Such estimates, which are also being updated in a contract study, will be included in the next iteration of this document. To assess and update the fleet-level emissions benefits of the ZEV program, ARB staff will conduct a thorough emissions impact analysis, using the updated on-road emissions inventory model. The model, EMFAC2000, is scheduled for Board review and approval in April. Once the model is approved, ARB staff will prepare an emission impact assessment. The updated assessment will be  vi   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised incorporated into the next iteration of this document and will be on the agenda for public comment at the May workshop.  vii   TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION ......................................................................1 1.1 Background ......................................................................1 1.2 The Zero Emission Vehicle Program ..................................1 1.3 Shared Long-Term Vision ....................................................2 1.4 The Biennial Review Process ...........................................4 1.5 The Purpose of This Document ...........................................5 MANUFACTURER STATUS ....................................................7 2.1 Introduction ......................................................................7 2.2 Manufacturer Volume Classifications ..................................7 2.3 Potential Classification Changes ...........................................8 2.4 Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements .........................9 2.5 ZEV Production to Date by Major Manufacturers ................9 2.6 ZEV Volume Estimates for 2003 ..........................................12 COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT ..............15 3.1 Introduction ....................................................................15 3.2 Manufacturer Commitments .........................................16 3.3 Air Resources Board Commitments ................................21 3.4 Additional Air Resources Board Activities .......................33 VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT ................................36 4.1 Introduction ....................................................................36 4.2 Pure ZEV Vehicles ...........................................................36 4.3 Full and Partial ZEV Allowance Vehicles .......................40 4.4 On-Road Neighborhood and City Electric Vehicles ..............48 BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT ................................53 5.1 The Battery Panel (Pending) .........................................53 5.2 Range vs. Cost ...........................................................53 INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT .........................................54 6.1 Introduction ....................................................................54 6.2 Battery Electric Vehicles ..................................................54 6.3 Grid-Connected Hybrid Vehicles .........................................55 6.4 Fuel Cell Vehicles ...........................................................55 6.5 Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles ................................56 THE EV MARKET ....................................................................57 7.1 Introduction ....................................................................57 7.2 The EV Driver Experience ..................................................57 7.3 Manufacturer Marketing Strategies (Pending) .......................60 7.4 Market Analysis (Pending) ..................................................61  2  3  4  5  6  7   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  8  COST 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5  INFORMATION (PRELIMINARY) ..........................................62 Introduction .....................................................................62 Battery Electric Vehicles ...................................................62 Fuel Cell Vehicles ............................................................62 Partial ZEV Vehicles ...................................................63 Infrastructure .....................................................................63  9  EMISSION BENEFIT INFORMATION (PRELIMINARY) ...............64 9.1 Introduction .....................................................................64 9.2 Per Vehicle Emissions--Battery Electric Vehicles ...............64 9.3 Per Vehicle Emissions--Fuel Cell Vehicles ........................65 9.4 Emission Inventory Analysis ..........................................65 CONCLUSION REFERENCES .....................................................................66 .....................................................................67  10 11   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 1 1.1 INTRODUCTION Background  Air quality in California has improved dramatically over the past 25 years, largely due to continued progress in controlling pollution from motor vehicles. Faced with ever more stringent regulations, vehicle manufacturers have made remarkable advances in vehicle technology. Several thousand zero-emission vehicles are now in everyday service on California roads, and the latest conventional internal combustion engine vehicles achieve emission levels that seemed impossible just a few short years ago. Despite this progress, however, air quality in many areas of the state still does not meet federal or state health-based ambient air quality standards. Mobile sources still are responsible for well over half the ozone-forming emissions in California, and passenger cars and small trucks are responsible for a significant portion of the mobile source contribution. State and federal law requires the implementation of control strategies to attain ambient air quality standards as quickly as practicable. 1.2 The Zero Emission Vehicle Program  The Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program was originally adopted in 1990, as part of the first ARB Low-Emission Vehicle regulations. The ZEV program is an integral part of California's mobile source control efforts, and is intended to create a market for advanced technologies that will secure increasing air quality benefits for California now and into the future. ZEVs have significant long-term benefits because they have no emission control equipment that can deteriorate or fail, and generate only minimal ""upstream"" refueling and fuel cycle emissions. Under the 1990 regulations, the seven largest auto manufacturers were required to produce ZEVs beginning with model year 1998. In model years 1998 through 2000, two percent of the vehicles offered for sale in California by large volume manufacturers were to be ZEVs, and this percentage was to increase to five percent in model years 2001 and 2002, and ten percent in model years 2003 and beyond. In 1996 the ARB modified the regulations to allow additional time for the technology to develop. The requirement for ten percent ZEVs in model years 2003 and beyond was maintained. In lieu of the sales requirement for model years 1998 through 2002, however, the ARB entered into Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with the seven largest vehicle manufacturers. Under the MOAs the manufacturers must place more than 1,800 advanced-battery EVs in California in the years 1998 through 2000, and the ARB must work with state and local governments to help develop ZEV infrastructure and remove barriers to ZEV introduction.  1   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised In 1998 the ARB provided additional flexibility in the ZEV program by allowing additional types of vehicles to be used to meet program requirements. Under the 1998 amendments, manufacturers can use extremely clean advanced-technology vehicles (referred to as ""partial"" ZEVs) to meet the 10 percent ZEV requirement, except that large-volume manufacturers must, at a minimum, have 4 percent of their sales be vehicles classified as ""full"" ZEVs. 1.3 Shared Long-Term Vision  Simply put, continued reliance on today's technology will not allow California to reach its health-based air quality goals. In ARB's vision of the future, therefore, the entire vehicle fleet will produce zero tailpipe emissions, and will use fuels with minimal ""fuel cycle"" emissions (emissions that occur due to vehicle refueling and the related production or transportation of fuel). As an ancillary benefit to the advanced technologies employed, the future vehicle fleet also will be highly energy efficient, use diverse energy sources, and will result in reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Based on staff conversations and briefings with the major automobile manufacturers, it appears that they share this vision. There is a general consensus that global customer demands will reward companies that can meet society's transportation needs while eliminating harmful environmental impacts. Thus, although there may be disagreements over the pace of change and the path to be followed, the ultimate goal is not in question. 1.3.1 Continued Emphasis on Zero Emissions Battery-powered electric vehicles and other ZEVs such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles hold distinct air quality advantages over technologies that use a conventional fuel such as gasoline in a combustion engine. High volatility liquid fuels such as gasoline are responsible for significant fuel cycle emissions. Vehicles with combustion engines inevitably exhibit deterioration that results in increased emission levels as the vehicle ages. They are also subject to becoming gross polluters if critical emission control systems fail. Although new vehicles have more durable emission control systems and on-board diagnostic systems that are effective in alerting owners to emission related problems, owners may not respond to failure signals promptly. The inspection and maintenance program will not capture vehicles that are operated without being registered, and repair cost limits may permit continued operation of some high emitting vehicles. For all of these reasons, vehicles with no potential to produce emissions are the ""gold standard"" of even the cleanest, most advanced new technologies. The commercialization of ZEVs is critical to the long-term success of California's clean air program. Even with the full implementation of the LEV II program, emissions from light duty vehicles will still represent a significant portion of total  2   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised emissions in the South Coast Air Basin. Achieving the new air quality standards for particulate matter, not to mention the state ozone standard, will require further reductions. Taking into account the anticipated growth in the number of lightduty vehicles and the number of miles they travel each day, it is clear that we need to eliminate emissions related to vehicle deterioration and fuel use from a significant portion of the light-duty vehicle fleet. ZEVs can accomplish this goal. 1.3.2 Near-Zero Technologies Also Play a Major Role The ZEV requirements have been instrumental in promoting battery, fuel cell, component and vehicle research and development. These requirements have also been successful in spawning a large variety of extremely low-emission vehicle technologies. Many of these technologies have at least some of the desirable qualities inherent to ZEVs, such as extremely low emissions of smog precursors and toxic air contaminants, reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, extended durability, or high efficiency. Such vehicles will play a major role in achieving further air quality improvement. First of all, because many of the technologies can be adopted at relatively low cost, vehicles using these technologies have the potential for widespread early market penetration without the need for subsidies or other incentives. Although the near-ZEV vehicles are not as clean as ZEVs, if produced in large numbers they provide a significant air quality benefit relative to the conventional vehicles that they replace. Second, because many of these vehicles use components also found on zero emission vehicles (e.g. battery packs, controllers, and electric drive), volume production of near-zero vehicles will help reduce the cost of components used on zero emission vehicles and hasten their commercialization. 1.3.3 Linkage to Broader Issues The mission of the Air Resources Board is to protect public health through the reduction of air pollution. The Board's primary focus is on the reduction of smogforming pollutants and toxic air contaminants. To date, most discussion of ZEV air quality impacts has focused on their smog benefits. In addition to their dramatic reduction in smog-forming pollutants, ZEVs also provide reductions in the emissions of toxic air contaminants. The benefits of reductions in toxic air contaminants are felt statewide. Recognizing that mobile source pollution may disproportionally affect inner city and low-income neighborhoods, however, reductions in toxic emissions from motor vehicles can help address community level public health concerns. Above and beyond these traditional air pollution benefits, ZEVs can also make significant positive contributions in other environmental areas. For example, the  3   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised use of alternative fuels can reduce the multimedia impact of fuel spillage on water quality, and can increase the diversity of California's energy supply. The smooth, quiet operation of electric drive vehicles can improve the quality of life in crowded urban areas. Electricity and hydrogen, which can be used to power ZEVs, can be produced from renewable resources such as solar, wind or hydropower, or biomass feedstocks. Thus these technologies can help pave the way towards a sustainable energy future. Perhaps the most important ancillary benefit, though, is that high-efficiency ZEVs and near-ZEVs can lead to significant reductions in emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The Air Resources Board does not currently regulate emissions of greenhouse gases. The Board is, however, working with the California Energy Commission to better understand the contribution of mobile sources to total greenhouse gas emissions, and quantify the climate change impact of various fuels and vehicle technologies. Even in the absence of specific regulatory requirements it is clear that, other things being equal, technologies that achieve lower greenhouse gas emissions are the preferred alternative. Meanwhile, auto manufacturers worldwide are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their vehicles in keeping with the Kyoto Protocol and other requirements in place or pending in other markets. ZEVs also can benefit California's economy as well as our public health. Because of their high-technology leadership, California companies have the technical and scientific capability to play a significant role in the design, development and production of advanced technology zero emission components and vehicles. ZEVs thus have the capability to provide comprehensive environmental, energy and societal benefits. While the Board's consideration of the ZEV regulation is firmly rooted in its air quality mandate and authority, the Board is aware of the multi-faceted effects of its policy choices. Over the long term the Board, in cooperation with its sister agencies, will devote increasing attention to an integrated consideration of such broader issues. 1.4 The Biennial Review Process  When the ZEV requirement was adopted in 1990, low- and zero-emission vehicle technology was in a very early stage of development. The Board acknowledged that many issues would need to be addressed prior to the implementation date. Thus the Board directed staff to provide an update on the ZEV program on a biennial basis, in order to provide a context for the necessary policy discussion and deliberation. The next biennial review of the ZEV program is scheduled for September 2000. The ARB is committed to working closely with all interested parties to ensure that they have an opportunity to provide comments and suggestions throughout the review process. The key milestones of the review process are as follows:  4   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  March 29, 2000  Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review Sacramento Public Workshop Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements Sacramento Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review El Monte Staff Report released to the public Board Meeting  March 30, 2000  May 31, 2000  July 2000 September 7, 2000 1.5  The Purpose of This Document  In preparing for the Board's upcoming Biennial Review, the goal of the staff is to provide a thorough, accurate portrayal of the current status of ZEV technology and the prospects for improvement in the near- and long-term. Extensive staff work is underway in a variety of areas. Staff efforts to date have included meetings with vehicle manufacturers, environmental groups, and other interested parties, on-site visits to the major vehicle manufacturers in Japan and in Detroit, discussions with EV drivers, and research on current and pending technologies and their environmental impacts. ARB also has contracted with outside technical experts to review the state of battery technology and production costs, and assess the full fuel cycle emissions and energy efficiency of various vehicle types and fuel sources. This document outlines the information developed to date, and describes other efforts underway that will provide additional information as the review proceeds. This staff assessment provides a snapshot of the status of our work at this point in time. Some portions are in near final form, while other portions provide a general outline that will be filled in as additional information is collected. In particular, the battery technology, cost, emission benefit, and EV market sections of this document will be significantly expanded and revised when ongoing work is completed. Thus a complete assessment of the full range of relevant issues will be first presented in the next iteration of this document, in time for the May workshop. This document is descriptive rather than proscriptive--it does not draw conclusions or make recommendations. Rather, the purpose of this staff assessment is to put forth technical information for public review and comment, develop a framework and context for consideration of the relevant issues, and  5   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised provide an opportunity for interested parties to point out any errors, omissions, or other problems in the factual basis that will be made available to the Board. Comments are welcome on all aspects of this material. Following the March public workshop and the review of all comments received, staff will make changes as appropriate and release a preliminary draft of the Staff Report and the accompanying Technical Support Document prior to the May workshop. After discussion at the May workshop and the consideration of all comments received, staff will release the final Staff Report and Technical Support Document in July. By following this process we hope to provide a firm, agreed-upon technical basis for the Board's policy review and discussion at the September Board meeting.  6   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 2 2.1 MANUFACTURER STATUS Introduction  The ZEV requirement applies to large and intermediate volume manufacturers (defined below). Beginning in model year (MY) 2003, at least 10 percent of the passenger cars and light duty trucks below 3750 pounds vehicle weight produced and delivered for sale in California by large and intermediate volume manufacturers must be ZEVs. An intermediate volume manufacturer may meet this ZEV requirement entirely with partial ZEV allowance vehicles (defined in Section 4.3.1) or credits generated by such vehicles. A large volume manufacturer must meet at least 40 percent of its ZEV requirement with pure ZEVs, full ZEV allowance vehicles, or credits generated by such vehicles. Large volume manufacturers may, at their option, meet the remaining 60 percent of their ZEV requirement with partial allowance vehicles or credits generated by such vehicles. A small volume manufacturer is not required to meet the percentage ZEV requirements, but may earn and market credits for the ZEVs or ZEV allowance vehicles it produces and delivers for sale in California. 2.2 Manufacturer Volume Classifications  Because MY 2003 is quickly approaching and planning for MY 2003 production has already begun, ARB staff has attempted to establish each manufacturer's volume classification and, thus, each manufacturer's ZEV requirement. For purposes of classification for 2003, small volume manufacturers are defined as those with California sales below 4,500 per year, using the average number of vehicles sold over the preceding three years. Small volume manufacturers are not subject to the ZEV requirement. Based on current production and sales data, ARB staff expects the small volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:          Dae Woo Motor Company Ferrari GFI Lamborghini Lotus Porsche Rolls Royce Saab Suzuki  Intermediate volume manufacturers are defined for 2003 as those with California sales between 4,501 and 35,000 light and medium duty vehicles per year, again averaged over the preceding three years. Based on the same data, ARB staff expects the intermediate volume manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:  7   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised              BMW Subaru (Fuji) Hyundai Isuzu Jaguar Kia Mazda Mitsubishi Rover Volkswagen Volvo  Large volume manufacturers are defined as those that are not small volume manufacturers or intermediate volume manufacturers. Based on the same data, ARB staff expects the large manufacturers in MY 2003 to be the following:       2.3 DaimlerChrysler Ford GM Honda Nissan Toyota Potential Classification Changes  Although historically categorized as a large-volume manufacturer, Mazda has consistently been selling fewer than 35,000 vehicles in California in recent years. Mazda will be considered an intermediate volume manufacturer beginning in MY 2003 if its production volume remains at the current level. BMW and Volkswagen have each been selling more than 35,000 vehicles in California in recent years. If these sales levels are sustained such that their 2000 through 2002 MY average sales exceed 35,000, they will need to meet ZEV requirements as large volume manufacturers beginning in MY 2006. Subaru, which is currently considered an intermediate volume manufacturer, has been selling near the lower limit of the intermediate volume manufacturer classification in California in recent years. Therefore, depending on its actual sales in model years 2000 through 2002, Subaru may be classified as either an intermediate or a small volume manufacturer in MY 2003. In 1998 Isuzu produced only light duty trucks between 3751 and 5750 pounds gross vehicle weight (LDT2s), which are not subject to the ZEV requirement. Rover produced only medium duty vehicles, also not subject to the ZEV  8   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised requirement. Therefore, although Isuzu and Rover are intermediate volume manufacturers, they will not need to produce any ZEVs in MY 2003 if they continue to produce only LDT2 and medium duty vehicles. 2.4 Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements  In recent years there have been many new multi-manufacturer arrangements, which have made it difficult to delineate individual companies. For example:       Ford fully owns Volvo and Jaguar, and partially owns Mazda General Motors fully owns Saab, and partially owns Suzuki BMW fully owns Rover Nissan is fully owned by Renault Volkswagen fully owns Rolls Royce Kia is partially owned by Hyundai, Ford, and Mazda  To clarify the ZEV-related emission compliance liabilities of companies in multimanufacturer arrangements, ARB staff will hold a workshop on March 30, 2000. The resulting policy will be implemented either by regulatory amendments or through issuance of a Manufacturer's Advisory Correspondence. Appropriate lead time will be provided before any changes become effective. 2.5 ZEV Production to Date by Major Manufacturers  The ZEVs that have been placed in California by major manufacturers are described in the following table. Manufacturer Model Daimler Chrysler Ford GM EPIC EPIC Ranger Ranger EV1 EV1 EV1 S-10 S-10 EV Plus Altra RAV4 Battery Type PbA NiMH PbA NiMH PbA (Delco) PbA (Panasonic) NiMH PbA NiMH NiMH LiIon NiMH Lease City Highway Number Cost ($) Range Range Placed NA 70 65 17 450 varied 450 349 424 499 439 440 455 599 457 92 84 94 75 111 143 46 92 125 120 142 97 69 86 78 113 152 43 99 105 107 116 97 51 308 460 0 162 110 76 330 37 486  Honda Nissan Toyota  Please note that all range figures used in this document are based on the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and the highway fuel economy driving  9   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised schedule (HFEDS) test cycles. Lease prices shown include governmental incentives. Information regarding the number of vehicles placed is somewhat out of date in this draft, and will be updated after the manufacturers submit their 1999 annual reports in late March. Overall, manufacturers have adopted similar strategies to make these vehicles attractive to customers. The vehicles typically are available via a three-year lease. This reduces the risk to the customer that their vehicle will be obsolete in a few years due to technical advances. Similarly, the warranty provided on the vehicles is comprehensive, and covers all components. This eliminates any durability issues or concerns on the part of the customer. Finally, the lease typically includes roadside assistance services. Because production levels for these vehicles are not yet sufficient to justify assembly line tooling and manufacturing techniques, the vehicles have been produced in a ""batch"" process. Under this method, a small quantity of vehicles (several hundred) is built at one time. A new batch is produced when necessary. A few details regarding the specific activities of each manufacturer follow. DaimlerChrysler To meet its MOA commitment, DaimlerChrysler began to place MY 1999 NiMH battery-powered Electric Powered Interurban Commuters (EPICs) in the 1998 calendar year. DaimlerChrysler chose the minivan platform for the EPIC because of the popularity of DaimlerChrysler's minivans and because of the minivan's versatility to either carry passengers or to be used as a utility vehicle. DaimlerChrysler has also been researching and demonstrating the potential use of conductive 'fast charge' technology. Using this fast charge capability, the EPIC is capable of more than 300 miles service in a single day. The EPIC is marketed to fleet customers only. Ford Ford first introduced its lead-acid battery-powered version of the Ranger EV pickup truck in 1998. The NiMH version was made available in 1999. Ford has entered into an agreement with the United States Postal Service to provide 500 electric vehicle platforms, based on the Ford Ranger, for use as Postal Service vehicles. Most recently, Ford has announced plans to market the two passenger Th!nk City and Th!nk Neighbor vehicles in the United States--the first vehicles of that type to be offered by a major automobile manufacturer in this country. Although lead-acid Ranger EVs and postal vehicles do not count towards the MOA requirement, they generate credits towards Ford's MY 2003 ZEV requirement. The Ranger is marketed to fleet customers. The Th!nk vehicles will be marketed to the general public.  10   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised General Motors General Motors introduced the first production battery-powered vehicle--the EV1--in 1996. The S-10 truck was introduced in 1997. In MY 1999, GM began offering second-generation EV1s with two battery choices--an advanced leadacid battery pack and a NiMH battery pack. Currently, 33 Saturn retailers in Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento, Phoenix and Tucson lease and service the EV1. Although lead-acid batterypowered EV1s and S-10s are not eligible for MOA ZEV credit, they generate credits that can be used towards the requirement for ten percent ZEVs in 2003. The EV1 is marketed to the general public, while the S-10 is marketed to fleets. On March 2, 2000 GM announced that it had decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in all 1997 Generation I, EV1 and 1997-98 S-10 Electric Truck vehicles. GM stated that these vehicles were produced with a charge port assembly that may fail during a charging event. If this occurs, heat could build up within the charge port and a fire could result without prior warning. GM urged drivers to park their vehicles and immediately discontinue any and all vehicle charging. GM specialists have been notifying drivers to make arrangements for vehicles to be returned to an authorized GM location, assist in the termination of leases, and discuss immediate transportation needs. As of this writing the final disposition of the vehicles and arrangements for replacement transportation have not been determined. Honda In 1999, Honda completed its MOA commitment and finished placing the last of its Honda EV Plus vehicles. Although Honda does not plan to continue production of the EV Plus at this time, it maintains the capability to resume production. Honda currently is focusing its efforts on EV Plus customer satisfaction issues, which will continue at least until the end of the vehicle leases. The EV Plus has been marketed in the Los Angeles area, San Diego, Sacramento, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and has been equally targeted toward the consumer market and to fleets. Nissan Nissan plans to fulfill its MOA commitment by the end of calendar year 2000 with the lithium ion battery powered Nissan Altra EV. The Nissan Altra EV is the first production electric vehicle that is equipped with lithium-ion batteries. After the initial California placement in 1998, Nissan decided to change to a different lithium-ion battery supplier. Due to efforts in making this change, Nissan did not produce any MY 1999 Altras. The new battery pack was incorporated in MY 2000 and was introduced in California in December 1999. Altra EVs are available to select California fleet users.  11   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Toyota The RAV4 EV is a five-door, four-passenger sport utility-like vehicle powered by NiMH batteries. In April 1999, Toyota announced that it had completed its MOA commitment. Toyota will continue product development and gather in-use information about range, performance and market acceptability of the RAV4 EV. The RAV4 EV is only available to fleet operators. Any vehicles placed in addition to Toyota's MOA obligation will generate credits towards the 2003 requirement. Mazda To date, Mazda has purchased credits to meet its MOA obligations and therefore has not offered any ZEVs under the Mazda nameplate. 2.6 ZEV Volume Estimates for 2003  California sales of passenger cars plus light duty trucks by the major automobile manufacturers total approximately one million vehicles per year. As a rule of thumb, therefore, each one percent of vehicle sales equals about ten thousand vehicles per year. The calculation of the actual number of vehicles needed to meet the ZEV requirement in any given year is considerably more complex, however, due to several factors:  Manufacturers can earn ""multipliers"" for vehicles with extended range, with additional allowances for vehicles delivered prior to 2003. Taken together these two factors can result in up to 10 allowances per vehicle for vehicles delivered in MY 2000. Specifically, each ZEV and full ZEV allowance vehicle that is produced and delivered for sale in California in the 1999 to 2007 model years and that has an extended electric range qualifies for a ZEV multiplier as shown below. These multipliers are based on range alone and are not dependent on the type of battery or the battery specific energy. MY 1999-2000 MY 2001 -2002 MY 2003-2005 MY 2006-2007 6-10 4-6 2-4 1-2  All-electric range 100-175    Manufacturers are given one additional model year to make up any shortfall in ZEV production. Thus, a manufacturer could choose to satisfy both its 2003 and 2004 obligation with vehicles delivered in 2004. In order to meet their obligation, major manufacturers must offer for sale a minimum of 4 percent pure ZEVs. They may, however, choose to meet the entire 10 percent requirement using pure ZEVs.  12   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised To provide a context for the Board's evaluation of the ZEV program, staff have developed a ""base case"" estimate of the number of ZEVs that the major manufacturers must produce in 2003 in order to satisfy the 4 percent ZEV requirement. Due to trade secret considerations this estimate does not rely on any confidential information provided in the manufacturer product plans. Instead, it is calculated using publicly available information, with the following assumptions:  The vehicles offered for sale in 2003 are identical in performance to the vehicles currently or most recently offered by the manufacturers. (The specific vehicles, their test cycle range, and the resulting number of allowances earned per vehicle are shown below.) Manufacturers do not take advantage of the multipliers available for early introduction; the entire 2003 obligation is met with vehicles produced in 2003. Each manufacturer's production volume in 2003 is equal to its production volume in 1998. Manufacturers meet 60 percent of their ZEV obligation using partial ZEV allowances, and 40 percent of their obligation (4 percent of sales) using pure ZEVs. (An estimate assuming that manufacturers meet their entire 10 percent obligation with pure ZEVs, using no partial ZEV allowances, is shown for comparison purposes.)      With these assumptions, 2003 pure ZEV production would be as follows: Manufacturer 1998 ZEV model Production (PC+LDT1) GM (see note 1) 84,106 1999 NiMH EV1 84,106 1999 PbA EV1 42,053 1999 NiMH S10 TOYOTA 201,473 1998 RAV4 EV FORD 186,977 1999 NiMH Ranger HONDA 172,768 EV Plus NISSAN 88,455 2000 Altra DAIMLER 105,691 1999 NiMH EPIC CHRYSLER TOTAL 965,630 Urban Range (miles) 143 111 92 143 71 125 129 92 Multiplier per vehicle 3.144 2.293 1.000 3.141 1.000 2.672 2.773 1.000 2003 ZEV Obligation 4% 10% 1,070 2,675 1,467 3,667 1,682 4,205 2,565 6,414 7,479 18,698 2,586 6,466 1,276 3,189 4,228 10,569  22,353 55,884  Note 1: This estimate assumes that GM sales are 40% NiMH EV1, 40% Panasonic PbA EV1, and 20% NiMH S10. This estimate, at roughly 22,000 vehicles, corresponds to about 2.3 percent of the passenger car and light duty truck production of the affected manufacturers.  13   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised It must be noted, however, that actual 2003 ZEV production may vary significantly from this number due to the various factors discussed above. Manufacturers are required, under the Memoranda of Agreement with the ARB, to submit confidential product plans outlining the product mix that they will use to meet the 2003 requirement (see Section 3.2.3 below). All manufacturers submitted these plans on a timely basis. All manufacturers demonstrated that they have the technical capability to produce the quantity of vehicles needed to meet their 2003 obligation. The manufacturers uniformly argued, however, that the cost of these vehicles remains high, and foreseeable battery technology will result in limitations on vehicle range. Thus in their view it will be difficult to develop a self-sustaining mass market for battery electric vehicles at this time. Staff notes that technical advances are steadily reducing the cost premium associated with ZEVs and that increased production volume will bring about further reductions. Because the status of battery technology is central to any discussion of cost and feasibility, such issues will be addressed more completely in the next iteration of this document, following the receipt of a report from a panel of outside experts that is reviewing battery cost and performance.  14   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3 3.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT Introduction  In 1996, the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board and all seven major auto manufacturers signed Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs). The major auto manufacturers who signed the MOAs are General Motors, Ford, Chrysler (now DaimlerChrysler), Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Mazda. The MOAs are intended to ensure the successful introduction of zero emission vehicles into the marketplace. They include binding commitments from each of the seven auto manufacturers as well as from ARB. Under the MOAs, the auto manufacturers must:       Offset the emission benefits lost due to the elimination of the ZEV requirement for 1998 through 2002; Participate in a market-based ZEV launch by offering ZEVs to consumers in accordance with market demand; Submit annual progress reports, and biennial product plans outlining how they will comply with the 2003 requirement; Participate in a technology development partnership, including continued investment in ZEV and battery research and development, and placement of advanced battery-powered ZEVs in marketplace demonstration programs; Collaborate with the ARB and the State Fire Marshal on ZEV safety training; and Provide the ARB with an on-site review of manufacturer activities and hardware related to the ZEV program.  The ARB, meanwhile, committed in the MOAs to working with state and local governments and others to help develop ZEV infrastructure and remove barriers to ZEV introduction. Specifically, the ARB must:          Facilitate the purchase of ZEVs in state fleets; Address insurance and financing issues; Work with other state agencies to ensure the availability of battery recycling; Work with local governments on planning and permitting of charging stations; Work with utilities and electrical contractor trade groups to ensure adequate training for installation and maintenance of EV charging systems; Support the efforts of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Working Council; Work with the State Fire Marshal and other emergency response officials to create a comprehensive ZEV emergency response training program; Observe the activities of the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium; and Support the development and implementation of reasonable incentive programs that enhance the near-term marketability of ZEVs.  15   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.2 Manufacturer Commitments  All of the major auto manufacturers submitted the annual reports and the product plans as required. These reports outline the progress made towards meeting the requirements of the MOAs. The following information is based on the manufacturers' submittals as well as private meetings and phone conversations with manufacturers. Staff concludes that the manufacturers and the ARB have met the commitments made in the MOAs. The remainder of this chapter provides detail on the individual tasks. 3.2.1 Cleaner Cars Nationwide (National Low-Emission Vehicle Program) The MOAs require the auto manufacturers to introduce low-emission vehicles nationwide in 2001, three years earlier than could be required under federal law. The National Low Emission Vehicle (NLEV) program was included in the MOAs to offset the emission increases associated with the 1996 revisions to the ZEV program, and thereby maintain the integrity of ARB's State Implementation Plan. Because non-California vehicles frequently travel through California or relocate to California from other states, cleaning up non-California vehicles results in emission reductions within California's borders. A 1996 ARB staff analysis indicates that by 2010 the NLEV program will result in emission reductions that are equivalent to those that would have occurred had the original ZEV program production requirement for 1998 through 2002 remained in place. In March 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that 23 automobile manufacturers--including the seven manufacturers that signed the MOA--and nine northeastern states have agreed to the new voluntary NLEV program. Starting in 1999, light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks sold in the northeast are meeting more stringent emission requirements. The program will be expanded nationally in 2001. This agreement between the EPA and the auto manufacturers will fulfill the MOA obligation. 3.2.2 Market-Based ZEV Launch The MOAs express the auto manufacturers' commitment to have the capacity to produce specified numbers of ZEVs--in addition to the demonstration vehicles discussed under Section 3.2.4.2 below--""that could be sold in California if warranted by customer demand"" (Section I.B.). The purpose of this element of the MOA was to ensure that manufacturers have the production capacity to meet market demand for ZEVs during the ramp-up period prior to 2003. Attached to each MOA as Exhibit A was the manufacturer's confidential November 1995 submittal identifying the manufacturer's annual capacity to produce ZEVs for the 1996 through 2002 model years, in accordance with their estimate of market readiness.  16   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised The timing of vehicle introduction by the various manufacturers has varied, based upon the type of vehicle, the battery employed, specific technical challenges that needed to be overcome, and near-term targeted markets. As of January 2000, Ford, General Motors, Honda and Toyota have placed vehicles above and beyond those required under the MOA demonstration program. The RAV 4, Altra and EPIC vehicles are currently only marketed to fleets, and production quantities are limited. Honda has announced that it will not produce additional vehicles, and will focus its efforts on evaluating customer satisfaction and providing customer support for vehicles currently in service. The net result of these manufacturer actions is that fleet customers face limited product availability, and the only vehicle currently available to retail customers is the EV1. Thus there is no four passenger, family vehicle available to the public. The manufacturers have concluded that those most likely to lease the current ZEV products are fleet managers, or a small subgroup of highly educated, highincome ""early adopters"". Thus most marketing efforts have been targeted at these specialized groups, rather than at the general public. Some parties have argued that the limited vehicle advertising and the limited availability of vehicles constitutes evidence that manufacturers are not complying with their MOA commitment to have the capacity to produce vehicles to meet customer demand. As defined in the MOA, ""Capacity to produce"" means that the manufacturer has available adequate vehicle production facilities either in-house or contractually with others, including the in-house ability or outside contracts sufficient to supply major vehicle parts and component needs. ""Capacity to produce"" does not obligate the manufacturer to produce, deliver or sell a specified number of ZEVs. (Definitions, Section X.D.). A lack of available product therefore does not in and of itself signify noncompliance with the MOA. An evaluation of compliance with the market-based ZEV launch requirement of the MOAs also requires an interpretation of the phrase ""if warranted by customer demand"". In the view of staff, a reasonable interpretation of customer demand implies demand that exists when the vehicle is priced at or near the manufacturer's cost. The current lease rates for the vehicles do not recover the relatively high cost of producing an EV today. Although it is common for manufacturers to sell some vehicles at a loss for larger corporate strategy purposes, the current differential between the lease prices for battery electric vehicles and the manufacturers' cost is substantial. Manufacturers have used various methods to determine the lease prices used for today's vehicles, but in no case have the vehicles been priced at a level that is close to the manufacturers' cost. Although we do not know what demand would exist if the vehicles were priced to recover at least the majority of their cost, presumably it would be less than that seen over the past several years.  17   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised In sum, staff concludes that manufacturers are in compliance with their commitment to have the capacity to produce vehicles that could be sold in California if warranted by customer demand. 3.2.3 Zero Emission Vehicle Product Plans Under the MOAs, the manufacturers are required to submit ZEV product plans prior to November 1 of the year preceding the scheduled review (in this instance, prior to November 1, 1999). Each manufacturer must submit corporate product plans that demonstrate compliance with the ZEV requirement for 2003. All of the manufacturers submitted the required plans on a timely basis. The product plans identify the manufacturers' strategies for 2003, including key decision points and other milestones. ARB staff have carefully reviewed the product plan submittals. Staff also made site visits to Japan and Michigan to tour the manufacturers' research and development facilities, and receive briefings on their research efforts. Based upon the review and site visits, staff is confident that the product plans accurately represent the status of work at the manufacturers. The information in these confidential product plans provides part of the basis for the staff assessment of the current status of ZEV technology, discussed elsewhere in this document. 3.2.4 Technology Development Partnership Under the Technology Development Partnership component of the MOA, the auto manufacturers agreed to make good faith efforts to promote and develop a market for ZEVs and to ensure ongoing ZEV-related research and development. To accomplish this effort, each manufacturer committed to continue battery research and development throughout the term of the MOA, and to place new ZEVs with advanced technology batteries into service in California through the advanced technology battery demonstration project. 3.2.4.1 Research and Development  All of the major manufacturers have extensive internal research and development efforts underway. The briefings and staff site visits in Michigan and Japan conclusively demonstrated that all manufacturers are actively pursuing a full range of zero and near-zero emission vehicle technologies. The extensive staffing levels and other resource commitments dedicated to advanced technology give evidence of the manufacturers' conviction that customer demands will force ongoing environmental improvement. Staff was impressed with the intense work underway in a variety of program areas, and the commitment by all manufacturers to play a leadership role in the commercialization of zero and near-zero emission vehicles.  18   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised In addition committed Advanced committed target with 2002. 3.2.4.2 to in-house efforts, under the terms of the MOA General Motors to contribute $8.9 million during Phase II of the United States Battery Consortium (USABC), while DaimlerChrysler and Ford have $3.34 and $6.67 million respectively. All three manufacturers are on their contributions and will completely contribute the full amounts by  Advanced Technology Battery Demonstration Project  The auto manufacturers each also agreed to produce their pro-rata share of up to 3,750 advanced battery vehicles between 1998 and 2000, and place them in demonstration programs designed to validate the new technology. Table 3-1 on the next page shows each manufacturer's share of the total ZEVs to be placed in demonstration programs. To receive MOA ZEV credit towards the commitments enumerated in Table 3-1, a ZEV must use advanced batteries. For the purposes of the MOAs, ""advanced battery"" means a battery with a specific energy of at least 40 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) for the 1998 calendar year and at least 50 Wh/kg for 1999 and subsequent calendar years. (Specific energy is the amount of energy per unit of weight and is related directly to range). Table 3-1 Auto Manufacturer MOA Advanced Battery Demonstration Commitments Number of Vehicles (Based on Average Market Share) Calendar Year 1998 1999 2000 Total Chrysler Ford General Motors 182 365 366 Honda Mazda Nissan Toyota Total by Year 748 1,500 1,502 3,750  51 103 103  181 363 363  101 202 203  28 55 55  70 141 141  135 271 271  The amount of credit given in the MOA for an advanced battery-powered ZEV is based on the specific energy of the batteries. Manufacturers may reduce the total number of ZEVs required if the batteries used in the vehicles have a specific energy greater than 50 Wh/kg. Table 3-2 on the next page indicates the number of credits that are granted for ZEVs that use advanced batteries.  19   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  Table 3-2 MOA ZEV Credits Allowed for an Advanced Battery-Powered ZEV Specific Energy 40 Wh/kg (1998 only) 50 Wh/kg (1999 and 2000) 60 Wh/kg 90 Wh/kg Number of ZEV credits allowed One Two Three  The advanced battery-powered vehicles that are being produced today have specific energy ratings of between 55 and 85 Wh/kg depending on the battery technology used. It is expected that advanced battery-powered EVs to be marketed in 2003 will fall approximately within this range as well. Linear interpolation is used to determine the number of MOA credits earned by ZEVs with specific energy over 50 Wh/kg. Therefore, ZEVs placed as part of the Technology Development Partnership are generating from 1.5 to 2.8 MOA ZEV credits per vehicle. As a result, the actual number of vehicles to be produced to meet the auto manufacturers' advanced battery vehicle MOA commitments will be approximately 1,800 rather than 3,750. In early 1999, both Honda and Toyota completed placement of advanced batterypowered electric vehicles for the Technology Development Partnership. General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Mazda are on track to complete their commitments by the end of 2000. Nissan requested and received approval to delay placement of a small portion of their vehicles for one year (until 2001) due to a battery supplier issue. As of January 2000 there were already more than 1300 advanced battery electric vehicles placed in California as a result of this project. At the conclusion of the project, there will be more than 1800 electric vehicles operating on advanced technology batteries on the roads of California. 3.2.5 Annual Reports The MOAs require manufacturers to file an annual report within 90 days after the close of each calendar year. The annual reports must provide information regarding ZEVs placed in California and elsewhere in the United States during the previous calendar year. The annual report must also contain information regarding the placement of ZEVs under the Technology Development Partnership. All manufacturers have submitted their annual reports as required.  20   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.2.6 Collaboration with ARB and State Fire Marshal The MOAs require manufacturers to collaborate with the ARB and the State Fire Marshal to develop the curriculum and materials necessary for a comprehensive ZEV safety-training program. This training program was completed in 1998. 3.2.7 On-Site Review The MOAs require the manufacturer to provide ARB staff with an on-site review of activities and hardware related to the manufacturer's ZEV program. ARB staff visited Honda, Nissan and Toyota facilities in Japan in December 1999, and visited General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler facilities in Michigan in February 2000. During these visits ARB staff received extensive briefings on the manufacturers' activities, and had the opportunity to view and/or test-drive a variety of vehicles. As a result of these visits and the information that has been provided, ARB staff have a thorough understanding of the status of work at each manufacturer. 3.3 Air Resources Board Commitments  As its part of the MOA, ARB committed to a number of tasks aimed at making California ready for the ZEV market. The following sections summarize the activities that the ARB has undertaken or supported to meet the commitments made in the MOA. 3.3.1 Purchase/Lease of EVs by State and Local Governments The MOAs specify that ARB must facilitate the purchase of ZEVs for appropriate applications in state fleets. ARB must work with the California Department of General Services and the California Energy Commission to establish vehicle specifications for the State Bid List, and work with the Department of General Services Office of Fleet Administration to ensure the sale or lease of ZEVs to selected state agencies. The Department of General Services has executed Master Service Agreements with the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (for the EV1 and the Chevrolet S-10), American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (for the EV PLUS), Toyota Motor Company (for the RAV4), and Ford Motor Credit (for the Ford Ranger). These Master Service Agreements allow all state agencies, as well as the University of California, California State University, the Community Colleges, and local governments, to lease ZEVs according to pre-defined and pre-approved terms, conditions and lease rates. This greatly simplifies the leasing process and allows for more rapid acquisition of vehicles. Additional Master Service Agreement with DaimlerChrysler Corporation (for the EPIC) and Nissan (for the Altra EV) are currently being developed.  21   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised As of February 2000, 25 different state and local agencies have leased or committed to lease more than 80 vehicles under these Master Service Agreements and prior agreements. These numbers are expanding rapidly due to the EV Sacramento program, discussed in Section 3.3.1.2 below. Leases or commitments have been made by the following:                          Department of General Services Department of Water Resources Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Department of Justice Department of Parks and Recreation Department of Food and Agriculture Department of Toxic Substances Control Department of Social Services Cal/EPA Air Resources Board Integrated Waste Management Board California Energy Commission California Highway Patrol CalTrans Bureau of Automotive Repair State Printer Franchise Tax Board California Exposition and State Fair University of California, Davis University of California, Los Angeles California State University, Chico Sacramento County City of Sacramento Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District Sacramento Metropolitan Airport  These totals do not include a large number of local agencies that have leased ZEVs using mechanisms other than the state Master Services Agreement. The ARB and other state and local agencies have undertaken other activities to further encourage ZEV leasing, such as the following: 3.3.1.1 The EV Loan Program  To encourage the use of EVs in public fleets and address its obligation under the MOAs, the ARB designed a three-year program to loan EVs at no cost to federal, state and local government agencies. The South Coast Air Quality Management District provides financial support for the operation of the program within its jurisdiction. The Department of General Services (DGS) assists with housing, maintaining and dispatching the loan program EV fleet.  22   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  The goals of the EV Loan Program are to encourage EV leasing by providing public agencies with a no-risk opportunity to see if electric vehicles meet agency needs, familiarize senior officials with vehicle capabilities, and publicize the availability of electric vehicles to governmental agencies and to the public at large. As of January 2000, the loan fleet includes fifteen vehicles--four GM EV1 vehicles with lead acid batteries, six Honda EV Plus vehicles with nickel metal hydride batteries, and five Ford Ranger pickups with nickel metal hydride batteries. Seven additional vehicles (two Chevrolet S10 pickups and five Toyota RAV4 vehicles, all with nickel metal hydride batteries) have been ordered to expand the program. The EV Loan Program began operation on a pilot basis in Sacramento in March 1998, using one Honda EV Plus that was provided by the DGS. The loan program's own vehicles were delivered in June 1998 (EV Plus), August 1998 (EV1), and January 1999 (Ford Ranger). The program expanded to Los Angeles in September 1998, the Bay Area in October 1998, and San Diego in April 1999. As of March 2000, there have been ninety-seven loans completed. Loan durations ranged from several days to three months, but the majority were one month. Seventeen loans are in progress, and twenty-two additional agencies are waiting to participate. Thirty-three vehicles have been leased as a result of the program, and several agencies are considering leases but have not yet made a final decision. The EV Loan Program is a large-scale effort to provide public agency managers the opportunity to drive EVs. The program has demonstrated that public agencies, when given real-world experience with EVs, often find that the vehicles provide an environmentally sound way to meet many of their fleet needs. The agencies have been able to develop a good understanding of EV range, reliability, operating and maintenance costs, infrastructure requirements, and other data needed to make informed leasing decisions, both now and in the future. 3.3.1.2 Department of General Services Outreach  The Department of General Services, Office of Fleet Administration, has an aggressive program in place to encourage state agencies to lease electric vehicles. In addition to its support for the EV loan program described above, the Department:    Provides free daily use of EVs through the state vehicle pool fleet Provides ride and drive opportunities to state executives Provides flexible lease terms with no-penalty cancellation provisions  23   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised     Sends letters to state fleet managers and Business Services Officers outlining EV availability Showcases EVs at numerous conferences and other events Participates in the national Clean Cities program Maintains a web site providing information on EV options ev Sacramento  3.3.1.3  Many California public agencies are already using electric vehicles. EVs are being driven by agency administrators, field and technical staff, and have been incorporated into a variety of public programs. One barrier that has hindered public agencies in acquiring electric vehicles, however, has been their higher initial cost when compared to their conventionally fueled counterparts. ARB is committed to increasing the use of electric vehicles by State agencies, and initiated ev Sacramento to assist with this commitment. The goal of ev Sacramento is to assist State and local public agencies in the Sacramento region to lease electric vehicles at competitive prices. By offsetting the initial higher costs of these vehicles, this program will significantly expand the use of electric vehicles in the Sacramento area. The program is jointly administered by the ARB and the Department of General Services Office of Fleet Administration. ev Sacramento is a three-year program, and includes most of the electric vehicles that are now commercially available. The vehicles that are available through the program include the GM EV1, Toyota RAV4 EV, Ford Ranger, Chevy S10, and the Honda EV Plus. Program staff is also working with Nissan to include the Altra in the program. The majority of vehicles will be placed in the first and second quarter of 2000. State and local agencies in the Sacramento area are eligible to participate. Participants pay reduced lease payments that are comparable to lease rates for conventional vehicles. In addition, ev Sacramento staff coordinate the delivery of the vehicles and the installation of charging infrastructure, and provide all training and user support. As of February 2000, 13 state and local agencies have committed to lease 58 vehicles under the program, on target to an eventual goal of more than 100 vehicles. 3.3.1.4 State Budget Initiatives  Each year, the state Budget Act appropriates funds from the Petroleum Violation Escrow Account (PVEA) to support a variety of energy and transportation projects. Portions of this funding have been used to subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles and infrastructure by local agencies.  24   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised The 2000-2001 proposed Governor's Budget requests significant funding from the Petroleum Violation Escrow Account and the General Fund for electric and alternative fuel vehicles, incentives and infrastructure. Highlights include:       $5 million for the Air Resources Board to participate in the Fuel Cell Partnership $6 million for the California Energy Commission to establish a clean fuels infrastructure for public agencies $5 million for the California Energy Commission to establish the Vehicle Efficiency Incentive program to provide incentives for the lease or purchase of electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicles $1 million for the California Energy Commission to develop a hydrogen fuel infrastructure as part of the Fuel Cell Partnership $0.5 million for the California Energy Commission to study issues affecting hydrogen fueling infrastructure $4 million for the Department of General Services to purchase alternative fuel vehicles for the state vehicle fleet  3.3.2 Insurance The ARB is required to work with the California Department of Insurance to establish reasonable rates for insuring new ZEVs, to promote insurance industry awareness of ZEVs, and to resolve other issues related to insuring ZEVs. ARB staff and Department of Insurance staff are not aware of any insurance issues that arisen with the market-based launch of EVs over three years ago. The EV user has had little difficulty obtaining necessary insurance. At least one manufacturer, Honda, includes comprehensive and collision insurance in the lease package. For drivers of other EV models, the insurance experience appears to have been smooth, with comparable coverage and rates available including second car discounts. On occasion, the EV user may need to spend additional time in the process if the insurer has not had experience writing a policy for an EV. Based on an informal ARB staff survey of retail EV users in California, it appears that insurance for EVs is available from virtually every insurance company licensed to do business in California. Staff also met with a local insurance broker, who represents a larger company, to discuss the process for establishing the insurance rate for an EV. The broker indicated that the process is identical to that used for any vehicle on the market. With the make and model in hand, the broker looks up a vehicle's ""insurance rating group"" (IRG). Vehicles with similar characteristics, (e.g., replacement and repair costs, typical damage, and model year) may be placed in the same IRG. If a vehicle has not been assigned to an IRG, or is a new model or model year not covered by an IRG, the industry standard practice is to calculate a rate based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). The broker visited by staff had an IRG manual that contained specific instructions for EV rates to be calculated using the MSRP. 25   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  As no significant insurance issues have arisen with the market-based launch, ARB staff concludes that insurance issues will not present obstacles to further expansion of the EV market. Staff will, however, continue to monitor insurance availability for EVs as the market grows. 3.3.3 Financing The ARB is required to work with the California Department of State Banking to develop risk assessment data to assist in securing financing for the purchase or lease of ZEVs. To date, financing issues have not presented obstacles to further expansion of the EV market. Financing has not presented a problem for retail consumers because to date the vehicles are primarily leased rather than purchased. The decision to lease EVs to consumers rather than sell the vehicles has not been based on concerns about financing availability. Rather, the auto manufacturers have indicated that offering lease programs to consumers protects customers from risks associated with investing in new, quickly changing technology. ARB staff will continue to monitor these areas to ensure that any future issues that arise are dealt with in a timely manner. 3.3.4 Battery Recycling The MOA directed the ARB to work with the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Integrated Waste Management Board, and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to ensure the availability of sufficient battery recycling capacity. To address issues related to EV battery disposal and recycling, the ARB contracted with ARCADIS Geraghty & Miller in 1994. This contract work was broken into two main tasks. First, the contractor evaluated battery technologies based on their performance and recyclability. This work was completed in March of 1995. In addition to determining where efforts should be focused in establishing new recycling facilities and developing cleaner technologies, task one recommended that a deposit of between $100 to $150 be levied on light-duty vehicle batteries to ensure they are returned for recycling. Task two compared the relative health and hazard impacts from EV battery recycling technology, and was completed in April of 1999. The main focus of task two was to compare the relative impact of recycling EV batteries in terms of cancer, toxicity, and ecotoxicological potential, as well as leachability, flammability, and corrosivity hazards. These impacts were evaluated for recycling methods, including smelting, electrowinnowing, and other appropriate techniques that apply to different battery technologies. A multi-attribute impact analysis was performed on the health and hazard effects resulting from the recycling and disposal of each battery type. The methodology used a semi-  26   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised qualitative ranking to weight the relative impact and establish a health and environmental impact score for each battery type. Due to the substantial uncertainties surrounding the analyses, the methodology is designed for comparison purposes only. While current battery constituents are fairly well known, they do vary with manufacturer and are likely to change in the future. In addition, there are substantial uncertainties surrounding the health impact values and future recycling technologies. With this said, a broad conclusion of the analysis is that the more advanced batteries expected to be used in larger commercial quantities in the 2003 timeframe represent a great improvement over conventional lead-acid batteries, both in terms of battery performance and impacts from recycling spent batteries. In addition to this contract work, ARB staff has also followed battery recycling issues at the national level by participating on the Department of Energy's Advanced Battery Readiness Working Committee. One of the Committee's main activities is to address issues related to EV battery disposal and to review progress made in developing new recycling methods for advanced batteries. At this time, there do not appear to be any overwhelming obstacles to recycling the battery technologies expected in the 2003 timeframe. Currently, there is one facility in the United States capable of recycling nickel-based batteries. Another plant in Canada is now successfully recycling large military lithium-based batteries. While recycling technologies are being developed and are expected to be in place, it will be necessary to build new recycling plants for certain battery types, such as lithium-ion, to accommodate their use in large quantities. Any new recycling facilities would be required to meet stringent air quality and environmental regulations that would minimize any adverse effects of the recycling processes. 3.3.5 Assist Local Governments with Public Infrastructure The MOA requires the ARB to work with local governments to provide assistance in planning and permitting quick charge and public charging stations. ARB has worked with utilities and electric vehicle infrastructure providers to assess charging station implementation issues and ensure that convenience-charging facilities are developed as needed. The California Energy Commission, ARB and other government agencies have also assisted with modification and adoption of electrical and building codes that address the needs of charging stations. This group instigated and coordinated the development of training for building officials involved with permitting and inspection of infrastructure installations. The current status of public infrastructure is discussed in more detail in Section 6.2 below.  27   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.3.6 Training for Installation and Maintenance of EV Charging Stations The MOAs directed ARB to work with utilities and trade groups representing electrical contractors to provide training for installation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging systems. To address issues associated with installation of EV chargers, especially related to building codes, electrical codes and training of permitting and inspection personnel, the California Energy Commission formed the Building Codes Working Group. The Building Codes Working Group includes the Energy Commission, the ARB, the California Building Officials, the California Electric Transportation Coalition, California utilities, General Motors, and Hughes Power Systems. The Building Codes Working Group developed revisions to the California Building Standards to allow for safe installation of electric vehicle charging systems. The Building Code changes, effective in 1996, defined EV charging equipment, added safety requirements, clarified the definition of refueling, and added ventilation requirements. The Building Codes Working Group also modified the California Electric Code to include a requirement to use approved or UL listed EV charging equipment. In an effort to provide a national standard for building code requirements related to EV charging systems, the Building Code Working Group focused much of its efforts through 1997 on preparing modifications to the National Electric Code. Changes suggested by the Building Code Working Group were forwarded to the National Infrastructure Working Council for approval and submittal to the National Electric Code governing organization. Following adoption of the California code revisions, a training program was developed for building officials, which covered the following:      The new Building Code and Electric Code provisions governing EVs; Plan check and inspection techniques for the new regulation; An overview of current and emerging EV technologies including automotive, batteries and charging equipment; An opportunity to see and drive current production vehicles; and Hands-on experience with charging system equipment.  Additional activities of the Building Code Working Group included development of Interim Disabled Access Guidelines for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in cooperation with the State Architect. Since EV charging stations are offered as a service to the general public, they are required to be accessible to those with disabilities. The guidelines give potential public infrastructure providers guidance on making installations accessible to those with disabilities. The final project undertaken by the Building Code Working Group was the development of an informational brochure for building officials, contractors and consumers. The brochure provides information about permitting and inspection  28   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised requirements, cites appropriate building and electric codes and gives phone numbers for agencies that can provide further information. 3.3.7 Support Efforts of National Infrastructure Working Council ARB is required to support the Infrastructure Working Council's efforts on standardization of power supply, emergency disconnect, and standard conductive and inductive charging systems. ARB staff has attended the Infrastructure Working Council's meetings, observing and participating in the Health and Safety Committee, the Connector and Connecting Stations Committee and the Connector Standardization Subcommittee of the Bus and Non-Road Committee. ARB's participation in the Health and Safety Committee has been focused on assistance with the proposed modification of the National Electric Code. ARB and California Energy Commission staff have observed and provided comments to the Connector and Connecting Stations Committee. This Committee, in turn, provided input to the Society of Automotive Engineers, which adopted a single standard for the butttype conductive connector used by Honda and Ford. ARB staff has also observed the early work of the Bus and Non-Road Committee and has been asked to participate in the Connector Standardization Subcommittee as it works to determine the need for connector standardization for buses and non-road vehicles. 3.3.8 Training Programs for Emergency Response ARB is required to work with the State Fire Marshal and other state and local emergency response officials and towing companies to create a comprehensive training program to ensure preparedness for incidents involving ZEVs. Similar to the Building Code Working Group, the California Energy Commission formed the Emergency Response Working Group with ARB, the California Office of the State Fire Marshal, the California Highway Patrol, utilities, auto manufacturers and industry organizations such as the California Electric Transportation Coalition. The purpose of the working group was to develop training designed to inform emergency response personnel about EVs and the differences in response procedures for incidents involving EVs. In 1998, the Emergency Response Working Group completed the development of a training program consisting of material to train instructors, an instructor's manual and compact disc, and slide teaching materials and student manuals. Train-the-trainer courses have been held throughout the state. Through the Infrastructure Working Council, the complete package of training materials has been distributed to every state Fire Marshal Office in the United States.  29   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.3.9 Observe Activities of the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) The MOAs require ARB to maintain its commitment to observe the activities of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) regarding the development of advanced technology batteries. The mission of the USABC is to pursue research and development of advanced energy systems capable of providing future generations of electric vehicles with significantly increased range and performance. The USABC has defined Mid-Term, Intermediate-Term (""Commercialization"") and Long-Term criteria that set forth increasingly stringent goals for acceptable electric vehicle performance and economics. Now widely accepted as goals for ongoing development, these criteria are viewed by the USABC as the minimum standards that must be met if EVs are to be acceptable to a significant percentage of vehicle users. Through the USABC, the three major U.S. vehicle manufacturers are committed to development of advanced batteries in keeping with their MOA obligation. ARB staff continues to attend the USABC Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings on a quarterly basis. By attending these meetings, ARB staff is able to monitor the progress of USABC contracts with various developers and gain insight as to the contractors' progress. While much of the information obtained is confidential, the following provides a general overview of current USABC activities and developments. The USABC completed its developmental efforts for Mid-Term battery technologies in 1999. The SAFT nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and Ovonic Battery Company (OBC) NiMH technologies successfully demonstrated improvements in battery performance, cycle life, and cost reduction. For example, compared to the USABC Mid-Term goals of 80 Whr/kg, 150 W/kg, and 1,000 cycle life, both developers have achieved at least 70 Whr/kg, 150 W/kg, and 800 cycles. In fact, the SAFT technology has realized a cycle life well in excess of 1,000 cycles. OBC continues to make progress towards achieving a 100 Whr/kg EV battery design. For hybrid applications, where power is of greater importance than energy, OBC has achieved specific power levels surpassing 750 W/kg. While the cost of each NiMH technology is currently more than twice the USABC MidTerm goal of $150/Kwhr, both manufacturers have successfully reduced production cost by over 25 percent during the last two years. Current USABC programs are focused on long-term battery technologies and meeting the USABC Long-Term and Commercialization goals. Two major contracts are currently in place investigating lithium-based battery technologies. The SAFT Lithium-Ion contract is currently in Phase I of the development process and is primarily focused on cell and module optimization. The LithiumPolymer contract is also at the development phase with promise to offer a safe and cost effective battery technology within the next five years. These lithiumbased technologies are expected to achieve specific energies well in excess of  30   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 100 Whr/kg. Improved specific power of greater than 200 W/kg and a cycle life of more than 600 are also expected. The key characteristic of battery cost should also benefit from these two technologies. It is currently forecast that both technologies should achieve cost goals of $150-175/Kwhr at annual production levels of at least 20,000 battery packs. The USABC is expected to initiate a Phase III program beginning in 2000. Phase III funding will be approximately $62 million and span a total of four years. While it is unknown which technologies will be chosen for Phase III, USABC has indicated that only those technologies capable of realizing full-size packs under the contract will be considered. 3.3.10 Reasonable Incentives  Under the MOAs, ARB must support the development and implementation of reasonable incentive programs that enhance the near-term marketability of ZEVs. Because ZEVs are a relatively new technology and are currently produced in limited quantities, they are more expensive than conventional vehicles. To enhance vehicle marketability in the near term and to assist in the transition to large volume production, it is vital to provide support, both monetary and non-monetary, in the form of vehicle and infrastructure incentives. Where possible, the ARB and other state agencies have supported the development and implementation of various incentive programs. The California Energy Commission has continued to support vehicle buy-down programs at the district level and has recently provided matching funds for the development of EV infrastructure. Recent legislation authored by Assembly Member Cuneen and signed by Governor Davis allows single occupant vehicles with ""inherently low emissions"" (ZEVs, as well as vehicles using alternative fuels, with extremely low tailpipe emissions and zero evaporative emissions) to use high occupancy vehicle lanes. The following list provides an example of the federal, state, local and private incentive programs currently available. 3.3.10.1    Federal Incentives    Tax credit for 10 percent of the cost of an EV, up to $4,000, through 2004. Business tax deduction of $100,000 for electric recharging sites. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 includes a ten year $50 million EV demonstration program and a fifteen year $40 million cooperative program between government and industry to research, develop and demonstrate EV infrastructure. Elimination of the luxury tax for alternative-fueled vehicles.  31   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.3.10.2  State of California Incentives     Up to $5,000 of the incremental cost of a ZEV for fleets located in Clean Cities (Bay Area, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Yolo-Solano) provided by California Energy Commission and the U. S. Department of Energy. CEC funds support the installation of EV charging infrastructure by new purchaser or lessee. PVEA funds are made available to local governments to support the lease of alternative fuel vehicles. Local Incentives  3.3.10.3      The Mobile Source Reduction Committee of the South Coast Air Quality Management District offers public and private customers a $5,000 rebate per EV purchased or leased. In conjunction with the CEC, several Air Pollution Control Districts offer $5,000 for the purchase or lease of EVs for public and private customers. The Los Angeles Airport offers free parking and charging for EVs in its Central Terminal Area. Charging stations were installed at the Los Angeles Airports as part of the Quick Charge Los Angeles EV program. The City of Sacramento offers free EV parking and charging at city garages. Utility Incentives  3.3.10.4     The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and Southern California Edison all provide discounts for offpeak recharging of EVs to retail EV customers. These discounts typically result in at least a fifty percent reduction in the cost of charging, with rates around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. San Diego Gas and Electric offers a discount rate for electricity used to recharge EVs during off-peak time periods as well as $50,000 in seed money to help local businesses and governments install charging stations in its service area.  In addition to these incentives, the ARB has been working cooperatively with government agencies, auto manufacturers and other stakeholders to determine the most effective way to support the introduction of ZEVs into the marketplace. New monetary as well as non-monetary incentives have been discussed in addition to possible extensions of the incentives that currently exist. Many of these existing incentives were put into place prior to the 1996 amendments to the ZEV program and it would be appropriate to extend them to foster the commercialization of ZEVs during the market-based introductory period.  32   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 3.4 Additional ARB Activities  ARB has instigated or been involved in a number of outreach programs, events and research contracts in addition to those addressed in the MOAs. Board members and staff have participated in local outreach as well as attended conferences and exhibitions promoting the use of zero-emission vehicles. 3.4.1 ARB Test Fleet The ARB has acquired a test fleet of EVs, with three GM S-10s, three GM EV1s, and two Honda EV PLUS vehicles. In an effort to gather information about the vehicles, their usage patterns, and issues associated with everyday EV use, ARB has set up a system to allow ARB employees to use the vehicles for between two days and a week. Employees are encouraged to do outreach to schools and other local groups. Participating employees are given a specific vehicle to drive for a week or a weekend and are encouraged to use the vehicle for as much of their normal driving as possible. Employees are then required to fill out a log that indicates usage pattern and any suggestions regarding vehicle usability and accessibility. This system has been very successful and gives ARB and users the opportunity to gain valuable experience with EVs and infrastructure. Based on discussions with employees and entries in the EV logbooks, these experiences are typically very positive and users find that the vehicle meets practically all their driving needs. (insert number of outreach events when compiled) 3.4.2 EV Rental Demonstration Program The ARB and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) are working together to support an electric vehicle rental demonstration program. This program will provide high visibility and convenient availability of EVs. The EV Rental Demonstration has the following objectives:     Establish a successful EV rental program that will give a large number of the general public and government employees the opportunity to experience the benefits and attributes of EVs. Provide positive image of EVs for public and policy makers. Gain valuable information regarding the use of EVs in rental car fleets. Provide clean air benefits in those areas renting the EVs.  EV Rental Cars L.L.C. was chosen through a competitive bidding process to conduct the EV Rental Demonstration program. EV Rental Cars is working jointly with Budget Rent-a-Car to rent EVs. In addition to the Los Angeles International Airport location, which opened in December 1998, and the Sacramento International Airport location, which opened in August 1999, the program will expand to five additional Budget Rent-a-Car locations:  33   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised      Burbank Airport John Wayne Airport in Orange County Ontario International Airport Downtown Sacramento Beverly Hills  The ARB is providing $100,000 to co-fund this program and 5 Honda EV Plus vehicles. The SCAQMD is providing $200,000. In addition, EV Rental Cars and the other subcontractors involved in the program will cost-share by contributing $252,000 in cash and $523,755 in-kind to this project. These subcontractors include SMUD, the City of Burbank, the City of Anaheim, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and Southern California Edison. 3.4.3 EV Long-Term Placement Program The Honda Motor Company provided funding for Supplemental Emission Projects, as part of a Settlement Decree with ARB. The Supplemental Emission Projects include the Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program, under which 25 Honda EV Plus electric vehicles have been made available to public agencies for long-term loans (6 months to one year). The goals of the Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program are to promote greater awareness of electric vehicles among the public, familiarize senior public and private officials with electric vehicles and their capabilities, and encourage the leasing of electric vehicles by public agencies. The Electric Vehicle Long Term Placement Program is a three-year program, now in its first year of operation. Vehicles have been placed with a variety of public agencies:              Yosemite National Park (2 vehicles) State Parks in Sacramento and San Diego (1 vehicle each) Griffith Park, Los Angeles San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Management District Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District Resources Agency Secretary Trade and Commerce Agency Secretary EV Loan Program, Bay Area (2 vehicles) and San Diego (1 vehicle) DGS State Garage Daily Rental ARB vehicle fleet (4 vehicles) EV Rental Fleet (5 vehicles)  Agencies that have received vehicles will provide a brief report at the end of the placement. The report will summarize the accomplishments of the program,  34   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised identify activities in which the vehicle was used, and note any problems that occurred. This data will provide on-going information by which to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, as well as track any vehicle or charging problems that may have occurred. After agencies have concluded their loans, ARB staff will solicit new participants for the program. 3.4.4 Participation in Conferences and Exhibitions  ARB has participated in a number of conferences and exhibitions including the North American Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Conference, several international Electric Vehicle Symposia, the World Electric Vehicle Expo, the Los Angeles International Auto Show, and various Clean Cities Conferences. ARB has attended, contributed papers and/or purchased booth space at these and other gatherings. In addition, Board members and staff have participated in ride and drive programs, public relations events and technical advisory groups. 3.4.5 Outreach Events  Board members and staff have been very proactive in conducting public outreach to schools, community events, and community groups. These outreach events have been very successful at a ""grass-roots"" level. Often, a Board or staff member is accompanied by a member of the Zero-Emission Vehicle Implementation Section who may give a presentation or participate in a demonstration of the vehicle. Over the past twelve months, ARB staff using vehicles from the ARB test fleet have participated in thirty-four outreach events at schools and more than twenty other events at youth groups, fairs, Earth Day celebrations, and other similar locations. Over the same time period staff from the ZEV implementation Section participated in an additional sixteen events including Science Day at the State Capitol, Clean Air Day, and the Los Angeles International Auto Show. These events provide participants with an opportunity to gain experience with new vehicle technology and have questions answered about EV capabilities.  35   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 4 4.1 VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT Introduction  In June 1999, ARB began meeting with auto manufacturers to discuss their obligations and plans for meeting the ZEV requirement in MY 2003. In December 1999 and February 2000, ARB staff visited all the large volume manufacturers in Japan and in the US to examine, first hand, the progress each manufacturer is making in preparing to meet the ZEV requirement as detailed in their product plans. Prior to the site visits, each manufacturer had provided ARB staff with product plans describing in detail how they intend to meet the MY 2003 ZEV requirement. The product plans included information regarding key development stages, decision points, and other milestones. In addition, the site visits provided ARB staff with a chance to examine prototypes of various types of advanced vehicle technologies. This chapter discusses the development status of ""pure"" zero emission vehicles, and ""full"" and ""partial"" ZEV allowance vehicles. It concludes with a discussion of new categories of vehicles such as city and neighborhood electric vehicles. These latter vehicles are discussed separately because they have different operating characteristics than full range vehicles and are intended to fill different market segments. 4.2 Pure ZEV Vehicles  This section evaluates the progress made to date in developing ""pure"" zeroemission vehicles--vehicles having no direct emissions. Vehicles can be certified as ZEVs if they produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria pollutant (or precursor pollutant) under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. These vehicles do, of course, result in a small amount of indirect emissions at stationary sources such as power plants or hydrogen production facilities due to the generation of electricity or hydrogen for use on board the vehicle. In the discussion of vehicle emissions (Section 9) the indirect emissions and environmental impacts from these stationary sources will be quantified in order to allow a meaningful comparison to other vehicle technologies. Pure zero-emission vehicles hold distinct air quality advantages over technologies that use a conventional fuel such as gasoline in a combustion engine. Vehicles with combustion engines inevitably exhibit deterioration that results in increased emission levels as the vehicle ages. They are also subject to becoming gross polluters if critical emission control systems fail. High volatility liquid fuels such as gasoline are responsible for significant fuel cycle emissions. For all of these reasons, vehicles with no potential to produce emissions are the ""gold standard"" of even the cleanest, most advanced new technologies.  36   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised From the inception of the ZEV program, the battery electric vehicle has been the leading candidate for meeting the ZEV percentage requirements due to its stage of commercial development. Since 1990, worldwide effort in the research and development of vehicle and battery technology has greatly improved the prospects for the successful commercialization of electric vehicles. More recently, fuel cell technology has gained worldwide attention as a technology capable of supplanting current internal combustion engine vehicles in the market while providing zero direct emissions (when using stored hydrogen). The following sections provide a summary of the developmental status and infrastructure needs for these two technologies. 4.2.1 Battery Electric Vehicles  Battery electric vehicles were first commercialized more than one hundred years ago. After giving way to gasoline vehicles in the first part of this century, several efforts were made in the 1960's and 1970's to reintroduce and commercialize the technology. While the basic concept of today's electric vehicle remains the same, significant advances in components and vehicle technology have provided new opportunities for the use of electric drive in passenger vehicles. 4.2.1.1 Description of Technology  Battery electric vehicles use an electrochemical battery to store energy. In addition to this energy source, an electric vehicle employs an electric powertrain that includes a motor and controller. Electric vehicles use one of three different types of electric motors: DC (both series and shunt), AC-induction, and permanent magnet DC-brushless. Controllers used with these motors are usually either solid-state electronic, pulsed-width modulation with power transistors, or insulated gate bipolar transistors. Other components include the battery management system, battery charger, state-of-charge meter, charging connector, and electronic protection devices. 4.2.1.2 Development Status  Historically, the inability of batteries to store sufficient energy at a reasonable cost has limited the market for battery electric vehicles. However, considerable advances in the last ten years in component technology have greatly improved overall vehicle efficiency and thus range. By improving the efficiency of drivetrain components and integrating the operation of the battery and drive train under normal operating conditions, EVs currently available can deliver nearly three times the range of EVs from the 1970's having the same amount of stored energy. Just as important, these advances have also included new designs that are projected to be cost comparable to the internal combustion engine vehicle in large volume production (not including the battery). The improved efficiency has been achieved in large part due to the improvements in efficiency of each  37   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised component mentioned above and through the integrated operation of battery and drivetrain under normal vehicle operating conditions. The production status of battery electric vehicles from the major manufacturers is discussed under Section 2.5 above. Because battery technology is the critical component in a battery electric vehicle, the ARB has contracted with four experts in battery technology to closely evaluate the state of development and cost issues of advanced batteries. The results of the expert study will be made available when their work is complete. A preliminary draft report is scheduled to be available prior to the May 2000 workshop. 4.2.2 Fuel Cell Vehicles Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that allow for the conversion of chemical energy of fuels directly into electricity. By doing so, the technology avoids the loss of efficiency and emissions of air pollutants that occur with the use of combustion-based engines. While originally discovered in 1839, the first practical use of the technology occurred during the early years of the manned space program in the 1960's. Subsequent manned space efforts, up to and including the Space Shuttle program, have continued to rely upon fuel cells for electric power. This success, in turn, has resulted in large efforts and investments in the technology to develop fuel cell technology for both stationary and mobile applications. More focused efforts to develop the technology for transportation have resulted in significant improvements in the core technology. The key motivations for this recent interest include concern over urban pollution, a need for alternatives to a diminishing oil supply, and growing concern over global climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions from mobile sources. Because fuel cells are powered by alternative fuels, and operate at high efficiency, fuel cell vehicles can help achieve both energy efficiency and energy diversity goals. A fuel cell vehicle can either store hydrogen or obtain hydrogen through the reformation of an alternative fuel. 4.2.2.1 Description of Technology  While there are several different fuel cell technologies available for use in vehicles, the leading candidate for automotive application is the proton exchange membrane (PEM). Simply described, a fuel cell consists of a membrane, two electrodes, and gas chambers. In acid electrolyte, hydrogen reacts at the electrode, giving up electrons while hydrogen ions are passed through the electrolyte. The electrons are used to operate an electric motor that can then propel the vehicle. After transferring to the cathode side, the hydrogen ions combine with oxygen, and the electrons that have produced work, to form water.  38   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Since no combustion is involved, water is the only product from the process. Many of the same components needed by a battery electric vehicle (e.g. the electric power train) are also necessary in a fuel cell electric vehicle. 4.2.2.2 Development Status  In 1998, the ARB contracted with a Panel of experts in fuel cell technology to assess the current status of fuel cells for transportation applications. According to the Panel's review of the technology, significant advances in fuel cell stack technology in recent years have overcome the technical barriers to attaining the performance needed for fuel cell electric vehicle engines. Efforts are now ongoing worldwide to integrate the latest fuel cell designs into fuel cell engines, and ultimately fuel cell electric vehicles. While much work needs to be done to successfully integrate fuel cell technology into vehicles, the Panel found no fundamental barriers to their commercialization. The report went on to note that ""in a complete success scenario, fuel cell electric engines and vehicles could become commercially available from two or three automobile manufacturers beginning in 2004/2005."" The biggest challenge now facing automakers is to package the necessary hardware and reduce the cost of the technology to a level comparable to the internal combustion engine. Since the release of the Fuel Cell Panel report in 1998, manufacturers have continued to advance the state of the technology. For example, recent news reports have described:     Significant improvement in fuel cell stack performance under freezing conditions Development of next generation stacks that provide higher power while reducing system size and weight Introduction of new prototype vehicles by DaimlerChrysler, Ford (Th!nk) and General Motors Development of advanced fuel system technologies  The availability projection noted above applies to for fuel cell vehicles that reform (or extract hydrogen from) a fuel such as methanol on board the vehicle. The operation of a reformer, however, results in ozone precursor emissions. Thus, to achieve zero direct emissions the vehicle has to store hydrogen on board the vehicle. While this greatly simplifies the vehicle's design (e.g. no reformer), it raises new issues regarding the storage of sufficient quantities of hydrogen on the vehicle. The storage of hydrogen, even at fairly high compression (e.g. 5,000 psi), requires roughly 10 times the volume that is needed for the storage of an equivalent amount of energy in gasoline form. Because the fuel efficiency of a fuel cell is significantly higher than that of an internal combustion engine, less fuel is needed to go a given distance. Nevertheless, passenger cars are not  39   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised currently able to accommodate enough hydrogen for adequate range without seriously compromising the passenger and cargo space. Manufacturers have explored options that include storing the hydrogen in lowtemperature liquid form, or bound chemically to a metal alloy. Efforts continue, but the potential for breakthroughs in hydrogen storage remains uncertain. While a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is believed to be the best long-term approach, its commercial introduction is not expected in the next five years. As part of research and development of fuel cell vehicles, automakers will demonstrate passenger cars using stored hydrogen in liquid form. The goal is not to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of this design, but rather to test, evaluate and refine all aspects of the fuel cell stack and engine. To address fuel cell vehicle and infrastructure issues, in April 1999 California Governor Gray Davis and industry leaders announced a fuel cell vehicle partnership that will demonstrate clean transportation technology on California's roadways in the future. The ""California Fuel Cell Partnership - Driving the Future"" makes the state home to a unique collaboration of auto manufacturers (DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen), energy providers (ARCO, Shell, Texaco), a fuel cell company (Ballard Power Systems), the State of California (Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission), and the United States Department of Energy. Associate partners, who bring specific expertise to aid in fuel, vehicle and bus demonstration activities, include Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Linde AG, Praxair, Methanex, the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, and the SunLine Transit Agency. The Partnership will demonstrate fuel cell powered electric vehicles under real day-to-day driving conditions. The Partnership will place about 50 fuel cell passenger cars and fuel cell buses on the road between 2000 and 2003. 4.3 Full and Partial ZEV Allowance Vehicles  In 1998 the ARB modified the ZEV requirement to allow ZEV credit to be earned by vehicles with near-zero emissions. This section discusses the development status of such vehicles. 4.3.1 Definitions and Requirements Under LEV II, ""near-zero"" emission vehicles may qualify to earn a ZEV allowance of between 0.2 and 1.0 per vehicle. Vehicles that qualify for a ZEV allowance of 1.0 are known as full ZEV allowance vehicles. Vehicles that qualify for a ZEV allowance of between 0.2 and 1.0 are known as partial ZEV allowance vehicles (PZEVs). Staff believes that this ZEV allowance approach towards satisfying the ZEV requirement will promote the continued development of battery-powered  40   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised electric and zero-emitting fuel cell vehicles, while encouraging the development of other advanced technology vehicles that have the potential for producing extremely low emissions. Manufacturers will be able to decide which mix of vehicles makes the most technological and economic sense based on their own strengths in each area. Large automakers must meet at least 40 percent of their ZEV requirement with pure ZEVs, full ZEV allowance vehicles, or credits generated by either of these vehicle types. They may meet the remaining 60 percent of their overall ZEV requirement with PZEV vehicles earning ZEV allowances of less than one. To earn a ZEV allowance for a vehicle, the manufacturer must, at a minimum, meet the following baseline PZEV requirements:     Certify Certify Certify Extend vehicle to 150,000 mile SULEV emission standards vehicle to zero evaporative emission standards vehicle to meet OBD II requirements for the life of the vehicle, and performance and defects warranty to 15 years/ 150,000 miles  One important advantage of battery and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles is that their ""tailpipe"" emissions do not increase when their components fail and are in need of repair. The extended warranty requirement for PZEVs is a very important element of LEV II and is intended to address this issue. It requires manufacturers to provide a 150,000 mile emission warranty under which all malfunctions identified by the vehicle's OBD II system will be repaired under warranty for a period of 15 years or 150,000 miles (whichever occurs first). This warranty is necessary to ensure that vehicles receiving credit for near zero emissions are able to maintain this performance throughout the useful life of the vehicle, as is the case with pure ZEVs. Vehicles that meet all of these minimum or ""baseline"" requirements earn a 0.2 PZEV allowance. Since ARB regulations do not specify particular fuel or propulsion technologies, there is a wide variety of potential vehicle fuel and drive system combinations that may qualify for PZEV allowance in the coming years. The overall ZEV allowance assigned to a vehicle is the sum of 3 individual assessments:    Baseline (minimum) PZEV allowance Zero emission vehicle miles traveled (VMT) allowance or Advanced Componentry Low fuel cycle emissions allowance 0.2 0.0 to 0.6 0.0 to 0.2  Table 4-1 on the next page lists a number of existing and hypothetical vehicle types, along with estimates of the maximum potential ZEV allowance they might be eligible to earn:  41   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Table 4-1 Draft Examples of Partial ZEV Allowance Vehicles, Full ZEV Allowance Vehicles, and ZEVs Vehicle Type (Must meet all PZEV requirements) Gasoline ICE Gasoline ICE / HEV CNG ICE LFCE ICE HEV, 0 mile ZE range Gasoline ICE HEV, 20 mile ZE range Hydrogen ICE Methanol Reformer FCV Gasoline ICE HEV, 40 mile ZE range LFCE ICE HEV, 20 mile ZE range LFCE ICE HEV, 40 mile ZE range LFCE ICE HEV, 73 mile ZE range Gasoline HEV, 100 mile ZE range Hydrogen ICE HEV, 20 mile ZE range Direct Methanol FCV Battery EV Stored Hydrogen FCV Primary Energy Source Gasoline Gasoline CNG CNG, methanol, hydrogen Grid Electricity Hydrogen Methanol Secondary Energy Source N/A Electricity N/A Electricity Zero Emission Range (miles) 0 0 0 0 PZEV Baseline Allowance .2 .2 .2 .2 ZeroEmission VMT Allowance 0 .1 (components) 0 .1 (components) .3 +.1 (max off-vehicle charging) .3 (0 NMOG) .3 (0 NOx) .4 + .1 (max off-vehicle charging) .3+.1 (max off-vehicle charging) .4 + .1 (max off-vehicle charging) .5+.1 (max off-vehicle charging) .6 Low Fuel Cycle Emissions Allowance 0 0 .2 .2 Total ZEV Allowance .2 .3 .4 .5  Gasoline  20  .2  .1  .7  N/A Electricity  0 0  .2 .2  .2 .2  .7 .7  Grid Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Electricity Grid Electricity or H2 with FC APU Methanol Grid Electricity Hydrogen  Gasoline  40  .2  .16  .8  CNG, Methanol, etc. CNG, Methanol, etc. CNG, Methanol, etc. Gasoline  20  .2  .2  .8  40  .2  .2  .9  73  .2  .2  1.0  100  .2  .2  1.0  Hydrogen  20  .2  .3 +.3 (0 NMOG)  .2  1.0  Electricity  Any Any Any  ZEV ZEV ZEV  42   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Abbreviations used in the table are: CNG: FCV : HEV: ICE: LFCE: PZEV SULEV VMT: ZE Range: Compressed natural gas Fuel cell vehicle Hybrid electric vehicle Internal combustion engine Low fuel cycle emissions Partial Zero Emission Vehicle Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Vehicle miles traveled Zero-emission range  It should be emphasized that the LEV II regulations do not establish specific ZEV allowances to be earned with particular fuel or propulsion technology choices. Rather, allowances are earned according to the three factors noted above, and depend on the actual performance achieved by a vehicle with a particular fuel and propulsion technology. The examples in the table below indicate staff's current assessment of the maximum achievable allowances possible for the vehicle types shown. 4.3.2 PZEV Availability The following section outlines current information regarding the availability of production PZEVs, today and in the future (2003 and beyond). 4.3.2.1 MY 2000 PZEVs Presently Available At the present time, only the Nissan Sentra `CA' (""Clean Air"") has achieved California certification for PZEV credit. Staff does not anticipate any further applications for PZEV certification for MY 2000 vehicles. Nissan Sentra CA (Gasoline SULEV, PZEV Credit =.2) Make Nissan Model CA Emissions Class PZEV-.2 (SULEV) City/ Hwy EPA MPG 26/ 33 Primary Energy Gasoline Secondary Energy N/A Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE Secondary Propulsion N/A  The 2000 model year Nissan Sentra CA is the first vehicle to be ARB-certified to meet SULEV requirements as well as the additional warranty and evaporative emissions controls necessary to achieve a baseline PZEV rating. Several key technologies allow the Sentra CA to achieve PZEV performance levels. These include:  Double-wall exhaust manifolds,  Quicker warm-up catalyst  A new combustion control sensor, and  43   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  An electronically controlled swirl control valve that reduces hydrocarbon emissions in both cold and warm start situations.  In addition, the radiators of all Sentra CAs are coated with Engelhard Corp.'s PremAir coating, which converts ozone entering the radiator into oxygen. The Sentra CA will be a limited production vehicle. Sales of the Sentra CA are scheduled to begin in March 2000 in California. 4.3.2.2 MY 2000 SULEVs Not Qualifying For PZEV Credit  In addition to the Nissan Sentra CA, two other MY 2000 vehicles have met certification requirements for the SULEV standard. These vehicles will not earn PZEV allowances, however, because they do not yet meet all of the minimum baseline requirements necessary for PZEV status. The MY 2000 Honda Accord SE has been certified to SULEV emissions standards, but has not been certified to attain PZEV allowance requirements for durability, warranty, or zero evaporative emissions at this time. The Accord SE would be eligible for a 0.2 ZEV allowance if the additional PZEV requirements were to be met. The MY 2000 Honda Civic GX is a CNG fueled ICE vehicle that is ARB certified as a SULEV and already meets zero evaporation requirements. It does not yet offer the enhanced 150,000-mile emissions warranty required for PZEV baseline certification. Honda states that they do not yet have sufficient durability data on this vehicle to justify the warranty extension necessary for PZEV certification. Since CNG fueled SULEVs that qualify for a PZEV baseline allowance of 0.2 would also be eligible to receive 0.2 allowance for low fuel cycle emissions, the Civic GX could someday qualify for a 0.4 PZEV allowance. Make Honda Honda Model Accord SE Civic GX Emissions Class SULEV SULEV City/ Hwy EPA MPG 23/20 28/34 (equivalent) Primary Energy Gasoline CNG Secondary Energy N/A N/A Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE CNG ICE Secondary Propulsion N/A N/A  4.3.2.3  Other Production Vehicles With Some PZEV Characteristics  The Toyota Prius is the first modern-day HEV to be offered for sale. As of January 2000, Toyota has delivered more than 30,000 units to customers in Japan. Toyota has announced its intent to certify the MY 2000 Prius HEV to SULEV standards, but is not expected to apply for certification to PZEV levels. Although the current Prius HEV is capable of traveling very short distances in ZEV mode, it cannot yet attain the minimum 20-mile all electric range necessary to earn a zero-emission range allowance.  44   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  If future versions of the Prius or similar gasoline HEVs with negligible zero emissions range meet PZEV zero evaporative emission requirements, they would attain an overall PZEV allowance of 0.2 baseline plus 0.1 for advanced electric drivetrain componentry, for a total PZEV allowance of 0.3. The Honda Insight is the first modern-day HEV to be offered to customers in California. It is currently certified at ULEV emissions level, so it cannot yet qualify for a PZEV baseline allowance. The Insight HEV design emphasis is on high efficiency, and hybridization enables it to achieve the highest mileage and consequently the lowest CO2 emissions of any gasoline-powered passenger car available in the United States. While the Toyota Prius lacks only a larger battery and a charging port to achieve significant zero-emissions range, the present design of the Honda Insight powerplant links the electric motor directly to the engine and prevents attainment of any motor-only, zero-emission operation. Make Toyota Model (Prius) U.S. Model name TBD Insight Emissions Class SULEV (target) City/ Hwy EPA MPG (TBD) Primary Energy Gasoline Secondary Energy Electricity: 1.8 kWh total energy, ~.18 kWh useful energy Electric ~.9 kWh total, ~.09 kWh useful Primary Propulsion Gasoline ICE, (~43 kW) Secondary Propulsion Electric Motor, (~30 kW)  Honda  ULEV  61/70  Gasoline  Gasoline ICE (54 kW)  Electric (10 kW)  4.3.2.4  Other Power-Assist HEVs  Staff expects several additional ""power-assist"" parallel HEVs to become available before 2004. These HEVs are also expected to be equipped with relatively small motors with less than 25 percent of engine power capability, and very small battery packs (less than 2 kWh). Although these power-assist HEVs are designed primarily to improve fuel economy and do not necessarily reduce criteria emissions, they can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Sales of ""power assist"" HEVs would also require manufacturers to increase their design and production capability for motors, inverters, and battery packs, which may be used in other types of electric-propulsion vehicles. 4.3.2.5 PZEV Availability in MY 2003 and Beyond  Under the ZEV regulation, intermediate manufacturers may meet their entire ZEV obligation using PZEVs, and major manufacturers may meet 60 percent of their ZEV obligation. Other than the Nissan Sentra CA, discussed above, no manufacturer has announced definitive plans to market PZEVs in MY 2003.  45   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Manufacturers have indicated that the most difficult challenges to be met for PZEV certification are the zero evaporative emission level and the 150,000-mile emissions warranty. In addition, the timing of PZEV introduction likely will be affected by manufacturer-specific external cycles such as the planned retirement date for engine families and their replacement by new engines. Staff anticipates, however, that additional PZEV models will be announced prior to 2003. 4.3.3 All Electric Range and Efficiency Improvement Both battery EVs and hybrid electric vehicles with zero-emission range that are able to charge from the electric grid can achieve high efficiency along with extremely low emissions. Typical battery EVs achieving 250-500 Whr/mile (AC) are also demonstrating an efficiency equivalency of 77-154 MPG (assuming energy content of gasoline is 38.6 kWh/gal). This high energy efficiency results in correspondingly low CO2 emissions. Although vehicle operating efficiency and CO2 emissions are not regulated by the ARB, staff recognizes that inefficient vehicles require more costly and complex systems to control criteria emissions. In addition, a malfunctioning low-efficiency gasoline vehicle operating up to 2 years between smog inspections has the potential to emit many times more emissions than a faulty high-efficiency vehicle. 4.3.4 Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) is a collaboration between the United States Government and the major domestic automakers. The longterm goal of the PNGV is to develop vehicles that will deliver up to three times today's fuel efficiency (80 miles per gallon) and cost no more to own and operate than today's comparable vehicles. At the same time, this new generation of vehicles should maintain the size, utility and performance standards of today's vehicles. The PNGV program near-term development emphasis has been on dieselpowered vehicles, because its goals are narrowly focused on fuel efficiency. The Partnership has, however, also funded developments that may have significant impact on future emissions reductions. Program contractors have developed improvements in lightweight materials, high-power batteries, fuel cell components, and reductions in vehicle road-load. For example, a recent PNGVfunded prototype announcement for the GM Precept discloses an extremely low aerodynamic drag coefficient of .163, which is less than one-half of the drag exhibited by a typical modern car. The ability of auto manufacturers to reduce aerodynamic drag to these extraordinarily low values will substantially reduce the power and energy storage requirements of future ZEVs and PZEVs, and may accelerate the introduction of cost-effective near-zero or zero emission vehicles.  46   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 4.3.4 HEVs With Significant Zero Emission Range Three PZEV allowances are added together to determine a vehicle's overall allowance. One of these three, the zero-emission VMT allowance, is based on the potential for realizing zero-emission vehicle miles traveled, and is determined as shown in the graph below.  Partial ZEV Allowance for Zero-Emission Range 0.60  0.50 Partial Allowance  0.40  0.30  0.20  0.10  0.00 0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 AER (Urban Drive Cycle) 80.00 100.00 120.00  During the development of LEV II, ARB staff believed that manufacturers would develop HEVs with battery packs that were smaller and less expensive than those needed for battery EVs, but still big enough to provide significant ZEV range and to justify recharging from the electric grid. These smaller packs for HEVs might have an energy storage capacity as low as 10-15 kWh instead of 30+ kWh in battery EVs, but would be sufficient to enable vehicles to attain a relatively large ZEV VMT allowance. Based on public announcements to date, however, staff does not believe that grid-charged hybrid electric capability will be made available on any MY 2000-2003 vehicles. The only hybrid electric vehicles expected during this time will probably be equipped with very small battery packs of less than 2 kWh capacity that are charged from gasoline-derived energy only. While LEV II was written to encourage vehicles with zero-emissions range like grid-connected HEVs because of their low emissions, high efficiency, and other ZEV-like attributes, it is unlikely that manufacturers will make use of this option to achieve higher PZEV allowances for zero-emission range before 2004. Automotive manufacturers and researchers have, however, developed and demonstrated several prototype HEVs that demonstrate significant zero-emission range and are able to charge their battery packs with grid-supplied electricity. No manufacturer has announced when these types of HEVs will become available, and most cite the same primary obstacle claimed for the slow introduction of BEVs--high battery cost. Although many of these advanced prototypes would not yet meet ARB's SULEV requirements, with further engine refinement to SULEV  47   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised standards they would achieve very high PZEV credits because of their ZEV range capability. Examples of functional prototype and demonstration ""grid connected"" hybrid vehicles include:  Several GM EV-1 based show cars,  GM Triax,  DOE/ SAE Futurecar and Futuretruck Student-competition HEVs,  Suzuki EV Sport,  Volvo HEV,  Ovonic-Modified (grid connected) Toyota Prius,  Audi Duo. 4.4 On-Road Neighborhood and City Electric Vehicles  Several classes of small on-road electric vehicles have begun to emerge in the last few years that will displace gasoline vehicle usage and increase overall zeroemission miles traveled within California. These vehicles are under consideration because they offer a number of desirable characteristics:  Very high efficiency  Affordable to build, and affordable to purchase  Neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) performance is adequate with existing, affordable, lead acid batteries  City Electric Vehicle (CEV) battery pack energy storage requirements are only about 1/3 that of a full sized EV, so the latest battery technology can be more affordable.  Reduced congestion (possible to park 2 NEVs in a single parking space)  Many niche market applications (station cars, resorts, theme parks, national parks, campuses, planned communities). 4.4.1 Background--Emerging Small EV Classes Small EVs exhibit a very wide range of capabilities and performance levels. They may be broadly classified as shown on the next page. Similar characteristics for full-range EVs are show for comparison purposes. Under current state law and ARB regulation, NEV/LSVs and City EVs all qualify as ""passenger cars"" and therefore are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. In terms of trip replacement and the resulting air quality impact, however, it is clear that a NEV, City EV, and a full-range EV differ significantly. ARB staff plan to evaluate the relative emission benefits of the various new categories of vehicles.  48   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Vehicle Type DOT Class Curb Weight Energy Storage Capacity 0.3- 2.8 kWh Drive System Peak Power ~1kW~10 kW Maximum Speed Typical Range Examples  e-bikes, scooters, motorcycles, etc. NEV/ LSV  N/A  Varies  Varies  less than 20 miles 20-30 miles  ZAP, ebike, etc.  LSV (Low Speed Vehicle) PC  950-1400 lbs.  4-9 kWh  ~5-15 kW  City EV (CEV)  18002500 lbs. typ.

Unlike NEVs, City EVs must meet all existing federal DOT/ FMVSS safety standards for equipment and crash protection. All are equipped with dual air bags, and many offer antilock braking systems. Examples of near-term CEVs include: Make Toyota Model e-Com Passengers 2 Curb Weight 1742 lbs. 2046 lbs. TBD 1852 lbs. 2310 lbs.

Most City EVs fit within the Japanese ""microcar"" classification limits, which restrict vehicle size to a length of less than 3400 mm (11 feet 2 inches) and a width of less than 1480 mm (4 feet 10 inches). In Japan, there is growing interest in this ""microcar"" class of for use as second vehicles. Some City EVs whose lengths are less than 2500 mm (8 feet 2 inches) are capable of parking 2-to-a-parking space to help avoid urban congestion. In countries where fuel costs are high, CEVs will be able to provide lower cost of ownership even in the relatively low build quantities expected in the early years of production. They are equipped with battery packs that are approximately one third the capacity (and cost) of those found in full-size, full-performance EVs. City EVs are also expected to demonstrate better operating efficiency than larger EVs and NEVs. All CEVs currently proposed are planning to make use of advanced battery technology (NiMH or LiIon). Toyota will be providing a fleet of 13 left-hand drive e-Coms for a demonstration program in Irvine, California beginning in February 2000. This program will be run by UC Irvine's National Fuel Cell Research Center in cooperation with Toyota. The e-Com can charge at either 120 VAC Level I or Level II Inductive charging stations. The Th!nk City is currently available for lease in Scandinavia. Plans are for 700 units to be imported into the US in 2000, with more than 300 of them coming to California for demonstration programs. Safety features include a driver-side airbag and seat belts with pre-tensioners. Nissan's Hypermini is the only NEV or City EV that is presently equipped with Lithium Ion batteries. Safety features include both dual airbags and anti-lock brakes. A Nissan Hypermini station car demo program in Yokohama is scheduled to begin in January 2000, with others to follow. Thirty vehicles are allocated for demonstration in California beginning this year. 4.4.3 Neighborhood Electric Vehicles/ Low Speed Vehicles (NEV/LSVs) These small EVs have a curb weight of under 1800 lbs., are equipped with speed limiting devices that limit maximum speed to 25 mph, and are restricted to use on roads with posted speed limits of under 35 mph. This vehicle class was legalized on a community basis in California with the passage of AB 110 in 1999. Arizona was the first state to legalize LSVs on a statewide basis. More recently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined a new Federal Low-Speed Vehicle class to establish minimum safety and equipment standards for these vehicles (49 CFR Parts 531.3 and 571.500). These regulations define a LSV as ""a 4-wheeled vehicle, other than a truck, whose speed attainable in 1.6 km (1 mile) is more than 32 kph (20 mph) and not more than 40 kph (25 mph) on a paved level surface"". Federal requirements do not require LSVs to make use of electric propulsion. The California vehicle code was modified under SB 186 to accommodate this new federal classification, and these vehicles have been legal  50   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised for use on public roads statewide since January 2000. An important distinction between Federal and California law is California's additional restriction of unladen weight to 1,800 lbs. or less. Although these vehicles appear to be similar to golf carts, they offer substantially more performance, better safety features, and are much more road worthy. NEV/LSVs are generally capable of much better acceleration than golf carts and can achieve 25 mph quite rapidly. Golf cart performance is restricted in accordance to cooperative industry standards to 13-15 mph, due to safety and turf maintenance concerns on golf courses. NEV/LSVs are usually equipped with higher-pressure road tires that might damage turf if used on a golf course, and NEVs must also be equipped with much better brakes than would be needed on a golf course. At the present time, all NEV/LSVs on the market are purpose-built designs intended for use as NEVs and are not derivatives of existing golf-cart designs. These improvements also increase the price of a NEV/LSV to more than $3000, which is more than a typical electric golf cart. At the present time, NEV/LSVs do not display efficiency labeling, as is required of all other road vehicles. Present EPA test procedures specify that the test vehicles must operate at speeds that are above the capability of LSVs, so the existing test procedure cannot be used to measure the fuel economy or range of these vehicles. Although test information is not yet available for these vehicles, it is believed that their operating efficiency may not be nearly as high as that of City EVs, which are equipped with much more technologically sophisticated componentry. In many cases, it is possible that NEV/LSV operating efficiency may even be poorer than that of full-size and full-capability battery EVs. Examples of near-term NEVs and LSVs are as follows: Make Th!nk Th!nk Bombardier GEM GEM GEM GEM Model Neighbor Neighbor NV E 825 E 825 E 825-2 E 825-4 Passengers 2 4 2 2+ short bed pickup 2+ long bed pickup 2 4 980 1200 980 1280 Curb Weight 950 lbs. 1200 lbs.

It will be available for sale at selected Ford dealers, via the internet, and at other unspecified outlets, and base price is expected to be approximately $6000. 51   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  Bombardier was the first NEV to apply for ARB certification. The Bombardier vehicles make use of sealed, maintenance-free lead acid batteries, and are available at a base price of $6,199. GEM has received certification for its MY 1999 vehicles. Prices vary with model, and range from $7000 to $10,000. Unlike some other LSV models, the GEM charging circuitry is designed to be compatible with existing, 120 VAC commercial GFCI-equipped outlets. GEM NEV/LSVs are the only ones equipped with flooded lead-acid batteries (all others are sealed designs), and will therefore require battery maintenance. GEM recommends checking/ adding battery water to each cell at least once a month. As noted above, under current state law and ARB regulation, NEV/LSVs qualify as ""passenger cars"" and therefore are eligible to earn full ZEV allowances. Due to their limited range and functionality, it is apparent that such vehicles will replace far fewer vehicle miles traveled, or trips, than City EVs or full range EVs. Staff thus has significant concerns regarding how such vehicles should be treated for ZEV credit purposes. ARB staff plan to evaluate the use and resulting emission benefits of such vehicles as information becomes available.  52   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 5 5.1 BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT The Battery Panel  The cost of batteries, both today and when produced in volume, is one of the most critical parameters of this review. To obtain the best available assessment, the ARB has contracted with a team of outside experts. This panel is in the process of meeting with leading battery suppliers and auto manufacturers. Their task is to review the state of the art regarding advanced battery design and manufacturing techniques, and report back to staff regarding likely cost trends for 2003 and beyond. Their draft final report will be presented at the May workshop. 5.2 Range vs. Cost  The current structure of the ARB regulatory and incentive scheme for ZEVs and partial ZEVs is intended to encourage the development of advanced batteries that will allow battery EVs to achieve extended range. For example, additional credit is given in the near term for ZEVs with a range of greater than 100 miles. This approach has been taken in order to encourage the development of vehicles with sufficient range to cover the majority of trips taken by typical drivers. Such range has been thought to be necessary to achieve mass-market penetration. In addition, the use of advanced batteries has the potential to extend the life of the battery pack compared to conventional lead acid batteries, and thereby reduce the need to replace battery packs during the vehicle life. It has long been assumed that technical advances will reduce the cost of advanced batteries such that in addition to providing extended range, they will be more cost effective than conventional batteries on a life cycle cost basis. Some parties have argued that the ARB preference for advanced batteries should be revisited. Proponents of this view make the case that the most costeffective application for battery EVs could be vehicles powered by lead acid batteries, and they question whether the increased range afforded by advanced batteries justifies the extra cost. Others have argued that one appropriate niche for battery EVs could be smaller, shorter-range vehicles for urban and commuter use, and that the ARB incentive structure should not discourage such applications. Staff believes that the current regulatory structure does not discourage these applications. Instead, it is designed to provide extra encouragement to extended range EVs. Staff is, however, interested in public comment on these issues.  53   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 6 6.1 INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT Introduction  To achieve zero and near-zero (SULEV) emission levels, together with minimal upstream refueling emissions, the advanced technology vehicles being developed by manufacturers often require the use of fuels other than conventional gasoline. Therefore it will be critical to ensure that the necessary refueling infrastructure is in place to support their widespread introduction. Recently, the South Coast Air Quality Management District and CALSTART announced an Internet web sit that allows drivers of alternative fuel vehicles to locate refueling stations quickly and easily throughout California. The site covers electric, compressed and liquefied natural gas, propane and methanol fueling facilities. The site will also list ethanol and hydrogen fueling facilities when they become publicly available in California. Clean Car Maps is located at http://www.cleancarmaps.com. Users pick an alternative fuel and enter an address and they will receive a map with icons designating the locations of refueling sites in the area. Users can then click on the site name to get comprehensive refueling information from a web database. 6.2 Battery EVs  Public infrastructure enhances the utility of battery electric vehicles. Drivers can extend the length of their trips if they know that convenient recharging facilities will be available at their destination. The public infrastructure for electric vehicle charging continues to expand in California. Currently, inductive electric charging stations and conductive electric charging stations are available at about 300 and 200 public locations, respectively. The bulk of the locations are in the greater Los Angeles/South Coast area, the San Francisco Bay area, the Sacramento Metropolitan area, and San Diego. In recent years, public infrastructure has expanded to locations in the North Coast, Central Coast, Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley. The charging facilities at individual locations vary. A grocery location may be equipped with a single electric charging station. A public parking garage is more likely to provide both inductive and conductive charging stations. Major destinations will have a larger number of charging stations. For example, parking Lot 1 at Los Angles International Airport is equipped with ten inductive electric chargers and 6 conductive chargers; there are also plans to place up to 20 inductive and 10 conductive electric charging stations at an additional airport parking lot (Lot 6) that is currently under construction.  54   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised ARB staff will continue participating in efforts to expand public infrastructure for electric vehicles. ARB staff has also identified several areas that warrant review in the near term:      Centralization and maintenance of up-to-date information on public charging station locations and operational status, with dissemination of the information via Internet and annual publication, Review and revision, if appropriate, of the criteria for selecting public charging locations to take into account recent increases in electric vehicle range, Modification of the public infrastructure to accommodate upgrades to chargers and connectors, and additional electric charging technologies, Development of state regulations and local ordinances to discourage parking of internal combustion engine vehicles (""ICEing"") at electric vehicle charging stations, and Promotion of a courtesy charging protocol to allow more than one user access to a single electric charging station. Grid-Connected Hybrid Vehicles  6.3  Grid-connected HEVs are generally expected to make use of the same public and private electric charging infrastructure that is currently being installed for battery EVs. One possible difference between battery EVs and PZEV HEVs would be a potential reduction in the demand for higher-power (Level II) charging stations, due to the fact that such HEVs can run on APU power when their battery packs are depleted. It may even be possible for 20 to 40 mile zeroemission range HEVs to make significant use of Level 1 charging (standard 120 VAC), because the smaller battery packs in these HEVs will be able to accumulate useful charge in reasonable time periods with more commonly available Level 1 outlets. 6.4 Fuel Cell Vehicles  In addition to testing vehicles, the California Fuel Cell Partnership (discussed in section 4.2.2.2 above) will also identify fuel infrastructure issues and prepare the California market for this new technology. Initial demonstration vehicles will run on hydrogen, directly from tanks on board the vehicles. Subsequent demonstration vehicles are likely to run on methanol fuel. Technology for other liquid fuels such as a cleaner form of gasoline will be evaluated. A key goal of the Partnership is to determine the best fuel infrastructure for the market entry of fuel cell vehicles. The Partnership will be devoting considerable attention to fuel cell fuel infrastructure issues. Staff will monitor the Partnership's efforts in this regard and report on status as appropriate.  55   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 6.5 Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles  There are currently more than 228 CNG vehicle refilling stations in California, of which 104 are available to the public. Most of these are ""fast fill"" type stations that are capable of refilling CNG vehicles in as little as 2 to 4 minutes. Although the ""fast fill"" fuel dispensing infrastructure is relatively sparse, low pressure natural gas is already delivered to most residences in California. Thus manufacturers are working to develop ""time fill"" devices that would be suitable for home refueling use. These ""time fill"" devices may take 6-8 hours (overnight) to fill a vehicle, but their availability could make dedicated CNG vehicles a much more viable option for non-fleet users.  56   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 7 7.1 THE EV MARKET Introduction  In this section, ARB staff describes several important components of the EV market--current EV drivers and their experience to date, the manufacturers' marketing strategies, and manufacturers' market analysis efforts to determine potential EV purchasers. 7.2 The EV Driver Experience  The EV driver experience provides important information to manufacturers, regulators and future customers on the utility and viability of EVs in the ""real world"". Lessons learned with the EVs placed to satisfy MOA obligations can be used to better define the future EV market place by educating potential customers, identifying necessary technology improvements, and identifying desirable EV platforms. Various organizations, including the manufacturers, have surveyed the selected individuals or agencies that have received MOA EVs. The results of past surveys and surveys planned in the near term by groups other than the auto manufacturers are briefly described here. At this time, ARB staff has only obtained results from one survey that included a significant number of retail customers. While ARB staff are aware of plans to conduct a major statewide survey of EV drivers, the results will not be available for several months. In the meanwhile, ARB staff obtained a preliminary description of the retail customer's ""EV Driver Experience"", by conducting an informal e-mail survey of EV drivers. Individuals are also invited to submit written testimonials regarding on their EV driving experience to ARB staff. The submittals will be used by staff to provide a composite description of the ""EV Driver Experience"" for the next draft of this document. The individual submittals will be compiled and provided to the Board. 7.2.1 Retail Customers Because retail customers were their primary market targets, there is extensive retail customer experience with the GM EV1 and the Honda EV Plus. The GM EV 1 was available for retail leases as early as December 1996. The Honda EV Plus has been available since 1998. 7.2.1.1 August 1998 Electric Vehicle Owner Survey  In mid-1998, the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC), in the South Coast Air Basin, distributed a survey to 284 EV Owners/Lessors taking advantage of the MSRC's buy-down incentive. 106 surveys were returned and 99 surveys were used in tallying the quantitative portions of the survey. All surveys returned were used in the comment portion of  57   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised the survey. The majority of the respondents were most likely retail customers, given that 77% of the EVs covered by the surveys received were for the twoseater GM EV1. The average length of ownership was slightly more than 13 months, and the average odometer reading was almost 9,000 miles. The survey focused on characterizing the EV driver and EV use. 82% of the EV drivers were male. The EV was typically the primary car in a household with more than one vehicle. When asked why they purchased/leased their EV, the top three responses were (1) concern for the environment or a desire to do their part to help clean the air, (2) a desire to be one of the first to adopt an up and coming technology, and (3) the EV's range fit their commute patterns/habits. Based on the survey, the EVs appeared to meet a wide variety of transportation needs:     Commute to and from work or school (71%) Work/business purpose during the work day (63%) Shopping, errands during the week (88%) Family trips/outings, errands on the weekend (75%) February 2000 Informal Survey Conducted by ARB Staff  7.2.1.2  There is currently minimal information from independent parties on the retail customer's EV driving experience. To provide information on their EV experience for this preliminary assessment, ARB staff conducted an informal survey of EV drivers via two Internet e-mail groups for EV1 and Honda EV Plus drivers. At this time, staff has received about two dozen responses. Staff will provide a more through assessment and updated information in the next draft of this document. A preliminary description of the survey results is included here. To date, the majority of respondents are GM EV1 drivers, with a few who drive the Honda EV Plus or both vehicles. All of the respondents, both long-term and short-term drivers, rate their overall EV experience as very positive. Almost all of the respondents mention performance, quiet operation, minimal maintenance requirements, convenience of overnight home charging (""a full tank"" each morning) and that the vehicles are ""fun to drive"" as contributing to their overall experience. Those driving EVs using advanced battery technologies, with EV range of 90 miles or greater, perceive a reduced need for public chargers except in strategic locations to allow occasional long distance trips. Respondents mentioned that they had initially expected to need to change their driving habits, but instead found that the EV meets about 95% of their transportation needs. Some respondents remarked on an unmet market demand for 4-seat EV platforms, and their desire for lower vehicle lease/purchase costs.  58   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 7.2.1.3 Near-Term Plans for a Statewide Electric Vehicles Users Survey  ARB staff are aware of near-term plans for a comprehensive statewide survey of EV users that will be sponsored jointly by the California Electric Transportation Coalition, the California Energy Commission and the MSRC. The survey is currently in the design stage. Preliminary results are expected at the end of March 2000 and a final assessment by May 2000. A description of the survey results will be provided in the next draft of this document. 7.2.2 Fleet Customers  Fleet customers are those who drive commercial rental EVs or a workplace fleet EV. Fleet customers typically have access to several EV platforms, including 2 or 4 seat passenger cars, trucks, utility vehicles and vans. 7.2.2.1 Air Resources Board Internal User Survey  The ARB Test Fleet, described further in Chapter 6.4.1, makes vehicles available to ARB employees for a period of two days up to a week. From July 1997 to August 1999, 245 employees made more than 2,800 trips with the test fleet. Two popular test fleet vehicles, a Honda EV Plus and a GM EV1, have been driven more than 25,000 miles and 20,000 miles, respectively. The employees were asked to complete a survey regarding their experience with each EV model. Analysis of 141 surveys returned by 99 employees indicates that the respondents typically had a positive to most positive overall experience driving the EVs. About 60% of the respondents indicated that they would consider leasing an EV for personal use. Some respondents identified several factors that they considered as impediments to leasing, including limited range, cost, and the inconvenience of charging. However, ARB staff note that the test fleet user does not typically have access to a charger at home and must share access to chargers at work. ARB staff will provide updated information on the test fleet user experience in the next draft of this document. 7.2.2.2 Office of Fleet Administration Daily Rental Electric Vehicle Survey  The Department of General Services, Office of Fleet Administration operates several State garages that provide daily and long-term vehicle rentals to state agencies. Since July 1997, the State garage in Sacramento has offered free daily rental of the Honda EV Plus and the GM EV1. As of October 1999, more than 525 round trips, averaging 20 miles, have been made with a fleet of five EVs. The EV users were given the opportunity to complete a short survey on their EV driving experience. ARB staff analyzed 70 surveys turned in over a several month period in mid-1999. All of the respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the overall performance of the EV and that the driving range  59   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised of the EV met their need (for the rental). Almost 70% indicated that they would consider leasing or buying an EV. The most frequent comment received was that the EV was easy to drive and performed well. Some respondents also mentioned that the range is too limited. 7.2.2.3 Southern California Edison's Municipal Fleet Survey  In 1999, Southern California Edison surveyed a total of 63 municipal agencies, colleges and transit agencies regarding their experience with their EV fleets. These fleets had a total of 178 EVs including the Chevy S10, Ford Ranger, GM EV1, Honda EV Plus, and Toyota RAV4. These agencies also had 67 vehicles in the acquisition process. These vehicles are typically used for administrative, enforcement and inspection purposes or as pool/loaner vehicles. On a per vehicle basis, 84% of those surveyed were satisfied with the operation of the EV. Areas of dissatisfaction included reliability, range and seat/payload capacity. While 96% of the agencies were interested in expanding their EV fleets, the respondents cited the cost (33%) and performance/range (53%) as barriers to greater EV use. 7.2.2.4 Near-Term Plans to Survey Commercial EV Rental Drivers  ARB staff intends to work with EV Rentals, in conjunction with Budget Rent-aCar, to develop a survey to offer to short-term commercial EV renters at several California airports. ARB staff will describe the survey responses in the next draft of this document. 7.3 Manufacturer Marketing Strategies  In letters dated September 28, 1999, and November 2, 1999, ARB staff requested information on auto manufacturers' marketing activities since the initial ZEV launch. All auto manufacturers responded to the request in a timely manner. ARB staff is currently reviewing the submitted materials and intends to describe each manufacturer's marketing efforts in the next draft of this document, with the understanding that information that the manufacturer has designated as confidential will be handled by ARB staff in an appropriate fashion. ARB staff provides only a general overview of manufacturers' marketing strategies in this preliminary assessment. The manufacturers offered a variety of EV platforms to the marketplace; however, only GM offered more than one platform. The majority of the manufacturers targeted fleet commercial customers to meet their MOA obligations. Two manufacturers, GM and Honda, targeted retail customers. Table 7-1 below describes each manufacturer's market target groups and its EV platform. The majority offered their EVs through three years leases. Only the lead acid battery version of the Chevy S10 was offered for purchase.  60   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised Table7-1 Manufacturers' Market Targets and Vehicle Models Primary Market Target and Vehicle Model Retail Fleet/Commercial Customer Customer Chrysler EPIC ( 5 seat van) Ranger (2 seat truck) GM EV1 (2 seat car) Chevy S10 (2 seat truck) EV Plus EV Plus (4 seat car) (4 seat car) Altra (4 seat wagon) RAV4 (4 seat sports utility)  Manufacturer Daimler-Chrysler Ford GM  Honda Nissan Toyota  The auto manufacturers used a variety of methods to promote public awareness of their EVs and to place their EVs. These methods included:       7.4 Participation in technology and environmental events, ""Ride and drive"" opportunities, Advertisements in newspapers and magazines, Advertisements on radio and television, Product placement in television shows and movies and major cinema releases, and Direct mailers. Market Analysis  According to the information submitted, some of the manufacturers have sponsored focus groups studies, market analyses, and mass surveys to identify potential EV customers. ARB staff is currently reviewing this material and will provide general descriptions of the results obtained from these various efforts in the next draft of this document.  61   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 8 8.1 COST INFORMATION (PRELIMINARY) Introduction  As noted in the opening discussion of the shared long-term vision, continued reliance on today's technology will not allow us to reach our health based air quality goals. In this vision of the future, the vehicle fleet will produce zero tailpipe emissions, will use fuels with minimal ""fuel cycle"" emissions, and will be highly energy efficient, with reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Thus any discussion of the costs and benefits of ZEV technology must look beyond today's immediate circumstances, and attempt to visualize what is necessary to move towards the desired future. From this perspective, it may be necessary to accommodate short-term losses in order to achieve long term gains. Automakers have had many years to refine and reduce costs for the manufacture of internal combustion engines. Electric drive vehicles are just at the beginning of the cost reduction cycle. This section presents preliminary information regarding costs for ZEV and partial ZEV vehicles. A more detailed assessment will be provided in the next iteration of this document, taking into account information from the external battery panel, and will be available for review and comment at the May workshop. 8.2 Battery Electric Vehicles  After reviewing several cost models and research (listed in Section 10, References), ARB staff projects that the initial cost of battery electric vehicles in high-volume production will be higher than the conventional vehicle even under the most favorable conditions. This is due to the high cost of the battery pack that overwhelms the possibly slightly lower cost of the rest of the vehicle (in comparison to the conventional vehicle). The projected long term operating costs for an electric vehicle, however, could be comparable to a conventional vehicle due to lower fuel costs (electricity vs. gasoline). While near term operating costs would be higher for an electric vehicle, continuous development and increased production volume building, along with lower fuel cost, could ultimately offset higher total battery cost. 8.3 Fuel Cell Vehicles  As indicated above, cost is also the major issue facing the development of fuel cell vehicles. While these systems are currently extremely expensive, efforts are ongoing to meet stringent cost goals for every material, component and manufacturing process. Ultimately, the use of automated manufacturing will be necessary for all components and subsystems if these stringent cost goals are to be met. To date, automakers have not yet encountered any fundamental barriers to meeting these cost goals.  62   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised  8.4  Partial ZEV Vehicles  Although Partial ZEV vehicles at present also face a cost penalty, that penalty is relatively minor and is expected to be further reduced as production levels are increased. Hybrid vehicles, with two propulsion systems, will be more expensive to produce than PZEV certified conventional ICE vehicles. Due to their increased efficiency, hybrid vehicles will recover at least a portion of this cost penalty via reduced fuel cost, as will battery EVs and fuel cell vehicles. 8.5 Infrastructure  Infrastructure for battery electric vehicles is reasonably widespread and there are no technical barriers to further expansion of the network. The current cost of the charging equipment is around $2,000, but is expected to decline as volume increases. Installation cost varies by site and can range from minimal added cost up to $5,000 or more per site. From the overall system demand standpoint, at market penetration levels expected under the ARB regulation electric vehicles do not increase on-peak energy or capacity requirements in California. As noted above, infrastructure issues related to fuel cell vehicles are being investigated by the California Fuel Cell Partnership, and will be discussed in more detail at a future date.  63   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 9 9.1 EMISSION BENEFIT INFORMATION (PRELIMINARY) Introduction  This section provides preliminary information on emissions from battery electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. The Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission currently have staff analyses and contract studies underway that will update and refine these estimates. These comparisons do not at present include ""upstream"" emissions from conventional vehicles due to fuel production and transfer, and vehicle refueling. Such estimates, which are also being updated in a contract study, will be included in the next iteration of this document. These discussions also do not include any consideration of air toxic emissions. The benefits of reductions in toxic air contaminants are felt statewide. Recognizing that mobile source pollution may disproportionately affect inner city and low-income neighborhoods, however, reductions in toxic emissions from motor vehicles also can help address community level public health concerns. The ARB is preparing a draft plan to address neighborhood impacts of air pollution sources. To the extent possible, a comparative analysis of toxic air contaminant emissions will be included in the next iteration of this document. 9.2 Per Vehicle Emissions--Battery Electric Vehicles  In 1995, the ARB staff worked with the California Energy Commission and interested stakeholders to determine the emissions impacts from the use of battery electric vehicles in California. To provide an ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of several different fuels and vehicle technologies, the study focused on the marginal emissions that occur in the South Coast Air Basin, or greater Los Angeles area. (Marginal emissions are the incremental emissions that are produced due to the operation of an additional vehicle.) The results of the CEC's analysis showed that power plant emissions from the use of battery electric vehicles in the South Coast Air Basin in 2010 range from 0.008 to 0.012 grams of NOx per mile. Marginal HC emissions from electric vehicles based on the CEC study would be less than 0.005 grams per mile in 2010. At the time, these emissions were essentially an order of magnitude lower than the cleanest certification standard required by the ARB. In 1998, however, the ARB adopted a new standard, the Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle standard that is comparable to estimated power plant emissions from battery electric vehicles. The study also quantified global greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the use of battery electric vehicles in the South Coast. While the overall efficiency of a battery electric vehicle is comparable to that of a conventional vehicle, total carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by over 50 percent when  64   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised compared to gasoline vehicles due to the varied sources (e.g. wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, natural gas) of electricity production in California. In early 1999, the CEC provided an update to the work done in 1995 to account for the major changes occurring as a result of de-regulation in power generation. The results from this study show that the incremental emissions will be similar to the emissions projected in the Energy Commission's 1995 EV Report. The primary difference noted is in the mix of incremental energy imported from areas outside of California. The majority of imported energy to meet the slight increase in off-peak demand is now expected to be from gas-fired power plants. The 1995 study projected a constant mix of gas, hydro and coal-fired generation from imported energy. Under either scenario, the total emissions that will occur in the South Coast Air Basin are projected to be extremely low. 9.3 Per Vehicle Emissions--Fuel Cell Vehicles  As with battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles will result in the emissions of pollutants at stationary sources producing the hydrogen. In 1996, ARB contracted with Acurex (now Arthur D. Little) to assess the full fuel-cycle emissions from several different fuels and technologies. The study focused on the environmental impacts in the South Coast Air Basin from each fuel. In the case of hydrogen, many different methods for hydrogen production were discussed. These include methane reformation, oxidation of oils, coal gasification and electrolysis. For purposes of estimating total emissions in the South Coast Air Basin, the report assumed that hydrogen would be produced from natural gas and biomass. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the overall marginal fuel cycle emissions in the South Coast Air Basin from producing and distributing hydrogen to fuel cell vehicles would be 0.0015 grams NOx and 0.0005 grams HC per mile of vehicle operation. These estimates are much less than the lowest emission standard (SULEV) and provide the most important reason for the ARB's interest in the technology. As for greenhouse gas emissions, the good overall efficiency of the fuel cell vehicle is expected to provide a positive impact on carbon dioxide and other global greenhouse gas emissions. 9.4 Emission Inventory Analysis  To assess and update the emissions benefits of the ZEV program, ARB staff will conduct a thorough emissions impact analysis, using the updated on-road emissions inventory model. The model, EMFAC2000, is scheduled for Board review and approval on March 23, 2000. Once the model is approved, ARB staff will prepare an emission impact assessment. The updated assessment will be incorporated into the next iteration of this document and will be on the agenda for public comment at the May 31, 2000 workshop.  65   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 10 CONCLUSION  The ARB is committed to working closely with all interested parties to ensure that they have an opportunity to provide comments and suggestions throughout the review process. The key milestones of the review process are as follows: March 29, 2000 Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review Sacramento Public Workshop Multi-Manufacturer Ownership Arrangements Sacramento Public Workshop Background Information for the September Review El Monte Staff Report released to the public Board Meeting  March 30, 2000  May 31, 2000  July 2000 September 7, 2000  Comments are welcome on all aspects of this material. Following the March public workshop and the review of all comments received, staff will make changes as appropriate and release a preliminary draft of the Staff Report and the accompanying Technical Support Document prior to the May workshop. After discussion at the May workshop and the consideration of all comments received, staff will release the final Staff Report and Technical Support Document in July. By following this process we hope to provide a firm, agreed-upon technical basis for the Board's policy review and discussion at the September Board meeting.  66   Preliminary Staff Assessment--Revised 11 REFERENCES  Publicly Available Reports: Montano, M., S.

GX005-39-2644386	A Student's Guide to Alternative Fuel Vehicles                   Hybrid vehicles   The word hybrid means something that is mixed together from two things.  Usually it refers to plants or animals that are breed from different genertically dissimilar parents. An example would be a mule, which is a hybrid of a horse and a donkey.  A new type of vehicle that is on our roads are hybrid cars.       One car is the  Honda Insight , which can get up to 68 miles per gallon on the freeway.   The car uses a small 1.0 liter, 3-cylinder engine with an ultra-thin electric motor.   Its primary power comes the gasoline engine, but it uses the electric motor when it is accelerating or climbing hills.  The electric motor does not need an eternal power supply for recharging. Its batteries are recharged by regenerative braking. This means that energy from forward momentum is captured during braking. This energy is then used to recharge the batteries.   Honda is also making its  Civic  sedan available as a hybrid that gets 51 mpg on the highway compared to the gasoline-only model that gets 39 mpg on the highway.   Another hybrid on the road is the  Toyota Prius . This four-person car gets 52 mpg.   It uses advanced technology to combine a small gas engine with an electric motor.  At very slow speeds, the car runs on its electric motor.  Driving around the city and at higher and freeway speeds, it shifts to both the gasoline motor and the electric motor, while also recharging the battery.     Other automobile companies will be releasing other types of hybrid vehicles soon.  In 2003 model year, Ford will begin selling a hybrid-electrici  Escape Sport Utility Vehicle .  This vehicle will use an electric motor around town and a gasoline engine while on the freeway.  the vehicle's gas engine will shut off when it is stopped, like in a traffic jam.          The regular gasoline-powered  Escape  gets 23 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.  The  Hybrid Escape  will get 40 mpg, but that better mileage may cost $3,000 above the gasoline model's $18,000 price tag. Incentives from government agencies may help decrease that extra cost.   Other auto companies are also working on hybrid SUVs. DaimlerChrysler is working on a hybrid  Dodge Durango  that will achieve a combined average of 18.6 mpg. The regular gasoline model gets only 15.5 mpg.   General Motors and Toyota are working together to develop a small hybrid SUV. Honda is planning a hybrid version of its  CR-V , which could be released in late 2003.         Read more on...      Alcohols  - ethanol and methanol .

These will be the first commercially available hybrid pickup trucks.                                The Honda Insight and Civic Hybrid and the Toyota Prius are still                available to consumers and offer exceptional gas mileage, the best                in their respective classes. These vehicles are also environmentally                friendly, emitting less global warming and smog-forming emissions                than most conventional vehicles.

It is no accident that the most fuel efficient vehicles                in some classes for the 2004 model year are hybrid-electric vehicles                (HEVs). Hybrids can be configured in many different ways to achieve                a variety of different objectives. They combine the best features                of the internal combustion engine with an electric motor and can                significantly improve fuel economy without sacrificing performance                or driving range. HEVs may also be configured to provide electrical                power to auxiliary loads such as power tools.               HEVs are primarily propelled by an internal combustion                engine, just like conventional vehicles. However, they also convert                energy normally wasted during coasting and braking into electricity,                which is stored in a battery until needed by the electric motor.                The electric motor is used to assist the engine when accelerating                or hill climbing and in low-speed driving conditions where internal                combustion engines are least efficient. Some HEVs also automatically                shut off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restart                it when the accelerator is pressed. This prevents wasted energy                from idling. Unlike all-electric vehicles, HEVs now being offered                do not need to be plugged into an external source of electricity                to be recharged; conventional gasoline and regenerative braking                provide all the energy the vehicle needs.               Potential buyers should also be aware that the federal                government is currently offering tax incentives for HEVs and other                alternative fuel vehicles. Some states also offer incentives.

This handbook section is a complete rewrite of the former AH 576. Noteworthy changes to the previous version of the handbook include the following:   A new chapter on methods for discovery of vessels and owner reporting requirements to assessors. An expanded discussion on the comparative sales approach with regards to using data on the Internet, published value guide books, and records from the Department of Motor Vehicles in determining market value. An expanded discussion on documented vessels, especially those documented with the U.S. Coast Guard and those qualifying for the 4% preferential assessment. A more detailed discussion on the determination of the taxable situs of a vessel and how the 1995 closing of the Coast Guard's documentation centers in California have affected a vessel's ""home port"" designation. A new section on the business inventory exemption for vessels. An expanded discussion on the exemption for vessels of more than 50 tons burden (Article XIII, section 3(l) of the California Constitution).        AH 576 is available on the Board's Web site at www.boe.ca.gov and can be accessed by way of the following links: (1) Property Taxes, (2) Assessors' Handbook.

SPEED, E XECUTIVE  FIRST DISTRICT SECOND DISTRICT THIRD DISTRICT FOURTH DISTRICT STATE CONTROLLER DIRECTOR   FOREWORD Assessors' Handbook Section 576 (AH 576), Assessment of Vessels, is a complete rewrite of the June 1973 version of AH 576. This new version of the handbook section is reorganized and contains new or expanded topics. It includes some text from the original manual but it also includes material concerning subjects not covered in the previous handbook section. The rewrite of this handbook section was undertaken by staff members of the Policy, Planning, and Standards Division (PPSD) of the Property Taxes Department in conjunction with the staff of the Property Taxes Section of the Legal Division and is the product of the authors' writing at the direction of the Board. The Department of Motor Vehicles or the Coast Guard is responsible for collecting registration fees on vessels; however, vessels are also subject to personal property taxation and assessors are responsible for the annual assessment of vessels. The objective of this handbook section is to give property tax appraisers, auditor-appraisers, and other interested parties an understanding of the issues concerning vessels for assessment purposes. It should serve as a guide and as an informational resource for the appraisal and assessment of this special, transitory type of personal property. As part of the process of producing this manual, Board staff worked with members of the California Assessors' Association, industry representatives, and other interested parties to solicit input for this handbook section. The Board approved this section of the handbook on February 6, 2002. Section 15606, subdivision (c), of the Government Code directs the State Board of Equalization to prescribe rules and regulations governing county assessors in the performance of their duties, and subdivision (f) provides that the Board shall issue instructions, such as those set forth in this handbook section. While regulations adopted by the State Board of Equalization are binding as law, Board-adopted handbook sections are advisory only. Nevertheless, courts have held that they may be properly considered as evidence in the adjudicatory process.1 The citations and law references in this publication were current as of the writing of the handbook section.

The appraisal and assessment of vessels present challenges found only with this special type of property. These challenges arise because of vessels' transitory nature, their various configurations and applications of use, the great diversity of builders and manufacturers, and the many types of vessels in use. This Assessors' Handbook section will provide a guide for the discovery, classification, and valuation of vessels and will identify those vessels qualifying for full or partial exemptions. In addition, this handbook section will clarify a central issue many assessors contend with  those questions regarding the situs of a vessel, to identify the proper taxing jurisdiction of this type of transitory property.  DEFIN  ITION OF A  VES  SEL  Revenue and Taxation Code section 1302 defines a vessel as ""every description of watercraft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, but does not include aircraft."" Vehicle Code section 9840 provides for a similar definition of vessels.3 The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) registers and numbers all vessels, as required by state law, that are not documented by the United States Coast Guard. It is useful to be aware of the DMV's definition as assessors exchange information with the DMV regarding vessels newly entering the county, those removed from the county, and any delinquencies on tax payments. Floating homes are not categorized as vessels for property classified as personal property, floating homes are assessed in Floating homes should not to be confused with houseboats. used as permanent places of abode, they are assessed in the See Chapter 7 for the definition of a floating home. tax purposes. Although they are the same manner as real property. Although houseboats may also be same manner as all other vessels.  For assessment purposes, vessels are further sub-defined as documented vessels and nondocumented vessels. See the discussion of this distinction in Chapter 4.  CLASSIF  ICATION  Vessels are included on the local unsecured roll, as personal property. Whether trailered or kept in the water, vessels are moved so frequently that it is difficult to determine if they are actually All statutory references in this handbook section refer to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless otherwise indicated. 3 Vehicle Code section 9840, subdivision (a) defines a vessel as ""every description of watercraft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water."" See Appendix B for the full definition of vessels in this code section. AH 576 1 February 2002 2   Chapter 1  located upon a specific parcel of real property on the lien date. Therefore, it is reasonable that a vessel be enrolled on the unsecured roll so that it is not a lien on real property. Vessels are personal property assessable to the owner, whether the owner is an individual, a business, or otherwise. Unlike most types of personal property, to be assessable, there is no requirement that vessels be used for business purposes. The tax rate for property on the unsecured roll is the rate of the prior year's secured roll of the same taxing jurisdiction.4 Special assessments are not levied against vessels, as such assessments are levied on real property only. Not all personal property is assessable and thus further sub-classification of vessels is necessary. Some vessels may be fully or partially exempt from property taxation due to the nature of their use or value, including those classified as business inventory. Such preferential assessments and exemptions are discussed in Chapters 4 and 6.  ENT  RY ON  ASSESSM  ENT  ROL  L  An assessment roll, as defined in section 109, is the entire listing of taxable property within the county. (The assessor actually prepares two separate rolls each year: the regular assessment roll and the supplemental assessment roll. Vessels are not subject to supplemental assessment; they are enrolled only on the regular assessment roll.) The assessment roll consists of two parts--the secured and the unsecured roll. Vessels should be included on the regular assessment roll and enrolled as unsecured property. Many county assessors prefer to group vessel assessments in a separate section of the unsecured roll rather than intermingle them with other unsecured assessments. Documented vessels meeting the requirements of section 227 (preferential 4 percent assessment) may be enrolled in a separate section at the end of the vessel section of the roll.5 Advantages of enrolling vessels on the unsecured tax roll, which permits the grouping of assessments, include:  simplifying of roll-searching problems for the assessor, tax collector, and others when a permanently assigned block of assessment numbers serves to identify a particular property type; making statistical data more readily available; eliminating the confusion that ensues when the value of a vessel is included in the total personal property value and a taxpayer believes that the amount covers other types of taxable personal property; giving each taxpayer a separate tax bill and receipt identifying his or her vessel;       4 5  California Constitution, article XIII, section 12. Documented vessels qualifying for 4 percent preferential assessment are discussed in Chapter 4. 2 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 1    avoiding the necessity of adding the tax on the vessel to an impound account when a lending institution pays the tax bill on the real property and secured personal property.  OVE  RVIEW OF THE  FAC  TORS IN  M  AKING AN  ASSES  SMENT  Of the seven basic determinations involved in the making of an assessment, the assessor only needs to consider five of the factors with respect to vessels. Two of the factors, classification and security, have already been determined due to the nature of vessels themselves as discussed earlier. All vessels are classified as personal property and should be listed on the unsecured, regular assessment roll. The other five factors of an assessment, assessability, assessee, situs, description, and value, are presented briefly below as a foundation for additional information presented in this handbook section. A more thorough study of description, value, and situs is necessary to make an accurate assessment of vessels; these factors are discussed in detail in Chapters 2, 3, and 5.  ASSESSABILITY OF PROPERTY Taxability vs. Exempt Property Article XIII, section 1 of the California Constitution states that, unless otherwise exempt as provided by the State Constitution or the laws of the United States, all property is taxable. The assessor must first determine whether a vessel is taxable (assessable) or exempt.6 The Legislature has the power to exempt personal property from taxation or to allow differential taxation of personal property; thus a vessel can be exempt from property taxation by reason of its ownership, use, and/or type. For example, business inventories are exempt by type. A complete discussion of exemptions is included in Chapter 6, Exemptions. It is important for the appraiser to be aware of exemptions in order to determine the assessability of the property being appraised. It is also important to note that not all exemptions are automatic, as some exemptions are allowed only if appropriate forms are filed timely. Statute of Limitations Section 532 establishes the statute of limitations on the assessor that affects the assessability of personal property. Vessels are assessable only if taxable on the January 1 lien date and the assessment must be made timely to be valid. Unless the assessee intentionally evades taxation, an assessment must normally be made within four years of the assessment period in which the property escaped assessment or was underassessed, as set forth by the statute of limitations.7 Lien Date Section 2192 identifies the lien date as January 1.8 An assessee filing a 2001 property statement (which declares vessel ownership as of 12:01 a.m. January 1, 2001), for example, will receive For purposes of property tax assessment and this text, ""taxable"" and ""assessable"" are used synonymously. Section 532. 8 Effective January 1, 1997, the lien date for locally assessed property was changed from 12:01 a.m. March 1 to 12:01 a.m. January 1. 7 6  AH 576  3  February 2002   Chapter 1  a tax bill for the fiscal year July 1, 2001  June 30, 2002. The sale or disposal of a vessel between the lien date and start of the fiscal year does not relieve an assessee of any tax liability.9 Owners who have sold their vessels after the lien date and prior to the fiscal year that the tax bill covers are still responsible for the taxes imposed. Assessees may need to be reminded that although the assessment is based on a vessel's value on the preceding lien date, the tax bill received is for the ensuing fiscal year. Thus, in the transfer of a vessel, any proration of taxes is left to the parties involved in the transaction and should be considered by the seller in determining the sales price. The following is an example of how the lien date affects the assessment as determined by the assessor: EXAMPLE 1.1 LIEN DATE On the lien date, January 1, 2001, a boat owned by owner A is located in Sacramento. The assessee (owner A) sells the vessel to a boat dealer (owner B) on January 15, 2001. It becomes inventory to owner B on that date. Owner A receives a tax bill for the fiscal year July assessment of the vessel. Although owner A does not covers, the bill is valid based on ownership on the lien date, January 1, 2001. Taxes on unsecured property are 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002, for the own the boat during the fiscal year the bill date, as owner A was the owner on the lien due on the lien date.  If the sale were reversed and the dealer sold the boat to owner A after the lien date, the boat would be exempt from property taxation as owner B's business inventory even though owner A owned the boat from January 15 through June 30, 2001 (and beyond). Generally, ownership on the lien date determines the taxability, situs, and assessee of the property.  Property taxes on the unsecured roll are payable in one installment, due no later than August 31 in the year which covers the lien date.  ASSESSEE A vessel is assessed to the person owning, claiming, possessing, or controlling it on the lien date.10 Assessments are usually made in the name of the person listed as the owner of record on the lien date, based on the official documentation or registration. Section 611 requires the assessor to assess property to unknown owners if the owner of the property is not known. If this is the case, the vessel may be seized and sold in order to pay property taxes. In the case where there is no clear title to a vessel, the assessor may assess the person claiming possession. If the vessel is no longer documented or registered, the assessment may be made in the name of the person who is accepting the care, custody, and control of the vessel. 9 10  See Example 1.1. Section 405. 4 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 1  SITUS Pursuant to the California Constitution, article XIII, section 14, all property taxed by local government shall be assessed in the county, city, and district in which it is situated. Situs, the place where property is situated, is therefore a very important factor in a valid assessment. The Vessel Owner's Report or the Vessel Property Statement, one or both of which a vessel owner may be required to submit (as discussed in the Description of Property section below), should aid in determining the taxable situs. All vessels currently on the roll should remain so until a taxpayer or other party provides written notice to the assessor that the vessel has established another situs. The burden of notification falls upon the taxpayer and, unless otherwise given notice, the assessor should enroll a vessel at its last known situs. If proper documentation for a new situs is provided, the vessel assessment should then be cancelled via an ""assessment roll change."" If a tax bill from another county is offered as evidence of situs change, the assessor should request that the owner show that the bill has been paid, so as to ensure that the tax bill from the other county has not been, or is not subsequently, cancelled. If a vessel will be or has been moved to another county within California and the owner makes a written declaration of the fact, a copy of the declaration should be sent to the other county where the vessel will gain its situs. The taxpayer may request a temporary mailing address and designate an in ""care of"" (c/o) person while away during cruising. Situs is seldom a problem with property that remains in one location, as in the case of real property, but many problems may be encountered when determining the situs of a vessel. Several situs statutes have been enacted and there have been numerous court cases with respect to situs determination. A complete discussion of situs is included in Chapter 5.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY An accurate assessment requires a description of the property assessed. Personal property must be described in the detail requested on the annual property statement11 or on a vessel owner's report. The property statement, mandated by section 441, is a vital link in the communication between the property owner and the assessor. The vessel property statement requests information regarding taxable property needed by the appraiser for making an annual review and accurate assessment of the property. Assessors use the property statement and vessel owner's report to obtain information on vessels. The vessel statement or owner's report requests a variety of information on the vessel -- such as the type, size, vessel number, builder, model, length, engine type, year built, equipment, cost, etc. A detailed discussion regarding property statements is included in Chapter 2.  VALUE OF PROPERTY For purposes of California property taxation, vessels are valued at their fair market value every year as of the January 1 lien date. An appraiser's or auditor/appraiser's most important function 11  Section 445. 5 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 1  is to determine the value of property. The terms ""fair market value"" and ""full cash value"" shall have the same meaning in the context of this handbook section. See the discussion of market value in Chapter 3, Valuation of Vessels.  AH 576  6  February 2002   Chapter 2  CHAPTER 2: DISCOVERY AND DESCRIPTION DISC OVERY  Developing a program for the discovery of information regarding taxable vessels and the verification of new and existing information is important to ensure accurate and valid assessments. Although discovery methods may differ from county to county, the primary methods of discovering assessable vessels involve the review of Department of Motor Vehicle records, Certificates of Documentation, and harbor master reports, referrals from other counties, and the use of field canvassing. Property statements are also useful tools in discovering assessable property. Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Reports With the exception of those vessels not required to be registered and those documented by the U.S. Coast Guard, all other vessels are required to be registered with the DMV. See Chapter 4 for information regarding the DMV's registration of vessels.12 Based on a vessel's CF number, the DMV can provide such information as the owner's name, address, vessel type, cost class, and other pertinent information. The DMV periodically sends reports to the county assessors' offices that list all vessels registered in the various counties. To facilitate the tracking of vessel owners and vessel locations, the DMV permits assessors' offices to establish an on-line communications link to access its database. This link saves considerable staff time in determining the accessibility of pleasure boats. Certificate of Documentation Such documents are issued by the Department of Transportation, United States Coast Guard division. If the name of a vessel or a Coast Guard document number is known, an assessor may access an Internet web site13 to find additional information on the vessel. The web site provides data on the owner's name and address, the vessel's gross and net tonnage, home port, type of service, whether or not the vessel is currently documented, etc. This information is useful in determining the situs of a vessel and determining if a vessel may qualify for an exemption or preferential assessment. See Chapter 4 for further information regarding the Coast Guard documentation of vessels. Harbor Master's Marina Reports Assessors should annually send a ""List of Vessels,"" Form BOE-576-C, to all harbor masters in their county to complete. This report identifies vessels kept at a boating facility in the county, whether in the water or in dry storage. These reports may be compared with the assessors' records and aids in the discovery of vessels that may have escaped assessment. The form should  12 13  As discussed in Chapter 4, some vessels do not require either registration or documentation. www.st.nmfs.gov/commercial/index.html. 7 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 2  be sent prior to the lien date and completed as of the lien date. A follow-up should be made if the report is not returned. Referrals from Other Counties Often county assessors receive information from a taxpayer that a vessel has relocated to another county. This information can be useful to determine accurate situs. Cooperation between county assessors is essential to the proper assessment of all vessels. Without it, many vessels would escape assessment and accurate information regarding the description, ownership, and situs of such vessels could be lost permanently. An assessor frequently receives information that a vessel has been taken to another county or was actually in a different county than that indicated by the information received from the DMV. This information should be routinely forwarded to the assessor gaining jurisdiction along with all other information that may be available, such as vessel description and previously assessed values. It is important that the recipient of this information follow it through to the point of assessment. If neither the vessel nor the vessel owner can be found where reported, the county originating the information should be notified so that further action can be taken by it to prevent an escape assessment. The originating county should send either Form BOE-576-A or Form BOE-576-BAH to the vessel owner's last known address and, upon the return of the form, the owner should have established the exact location of the vessel. Field Canvass Field canvassing is a technique that involves physically viewing vessels at their place of docking. The appraiser should conduct field canvassing near the lien date, note any vessels located at docks and in marinas that are not listed in their files, and investigate the status of such vessels. It is also useful to review the harbor master's report when conducting a field canvas. Property Statements The vessel property statement provides detailed information regarding a vessel to aid in a more accurate assessment. Furthermore, owners may install additional equipment on their vessels and identify such equipment on the property statement. Assessors use these statements to gather information and ultimately determine assessable value.  DESCRIPTION An accurate assessment requires a description of the property assessed. Property statements and other vessel forms used by the assessor provide essential information on vessels. Pursuant to section 445, personal property must be described in the detail requested on the annual property statement.  AH 576  8  February 2002   Chapter 2  PROPERTY STATEMENTS Property Statements are declarations of assessable property signed by the assessee under penalty of perjury. Assessors use these property statements to gather information and ultimately determine the assessable value of property. The assessor should furnish the property statement to every person required by law to file and to those other persons requested to file. Failure of the assessor to request or secure the property statement, however, does not render any assessment invalid.14 The Board-prescribed Vessel Property Statement is Form BOE-576-D. Each person owning a vessel having an aggregate cost of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more for any assessment year is required to file a signed property statement with the assessor.15 Other owners are required to file only upon request of the assessor. Owners must report the aggregate cost of the vessel, including all affixed boat equipment and accessories, as well as sales tax. When boat dealers report a vessel's purchase price to the DMV, the sales price that is the basis of value includes sales tax and freight charges, if applicable. Form BOE-576-D Historically, many assessors have chosen to utilize their own vessel property statement or questionnaire in lieu of the Board-prescribed Vessel Property Statement, especially for vessels with a cost of less than $100,000. However, the statutory provision permitting the application of a 10 percent penalty for late filing of a statement is only applicable in situations where the Board-prescribed form is used.16 Therefore, the Board recommends that assessors use the Board-prescribed Vessel Property Statement, Form BOE-576-D, for all vessels, regardless of their cost. The assessor may rearrange content and alter the size and design of the Board-prescribed form, but the proposed, rearranged form must be approved by the Board following procedures described in Rule 171, subsection (a). A copy of this form is included in Appendix A. The owner's Vessel Property Statement shall be filed annually with the assessor between the lien date, January 1, and 5 p.m., April 1 for information as of 12:01 a.m. January 1. Pursuant to section 441, the statement shall be declared to be true under penalty of perjury. A property statement may be amended until is due, for errors and omissions not willfully section 463 shall not apply to an amended the original property statement was filed in a May 31 of the year in which the property statement intended by the assessee. The penalty authorized by statement received prior to May 31, provided that timely manner.  A person owning a vessel that does not require the filing of a property statement shall file a signed property statement (BOE-576-D), if requested by the assessor.  14 15 16  Section 441, subdivision (a). Ibid. Section 463 provides for penalty application if not filed by May 7. 9 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 2  Other Vessel Forms The Board has several other forms that can be useful in obtaining information on vessels. These are BOE-576-A, BOE-576-BAH, BOE-576-B1, and BOE-576-C. Although the Board suggests the use of these alternative forms, they are not Board-prescribed and accordingly the penalty assessment for failure to file cannot be applied. For those vessels with an aggregate cost of less than $100,000, an owner is not required to file an annual property statement. Assessors may utilize a Vessel Owner's Report, Form BOE-576-B1, or postcard size Form BOE-576-BAH, to request the description of these vessels. Assessors may also rely upon Form BOE-576-A, which should be sent annually to each vessel owner of record.  BOE-576-A, Vessel or Aircraft Form, is a postcard style form that can be used to confirm continued ownership and situs of a vessel. An owner, when returning this postcard, should indicate whether any modifications have been made to a vessel's motor, hull, or frame. BOE-576-BAH, Vessel Form, is a postcard style vessel questionnaire that requests information about a vessel, its acquisition cost, and location. BOE-576-B1, Vessel Owner's Report, requests information about the vessel, its acquisition cost, and location. It is an alternative to BOE-576-BAH for those assessors who prefer a letter format. BOE-576-C, List of Vessels, is submitted by harbor masters and identifies vessels located in a boating facility. This form, however, does not provide any other description of a vessel.       AH 576  10  February 2002   Chapter 3  CHAPTER 3: VALUATION OF VESSELS VAL UE  CONCEPT  The fundamental principles of appraisal apply to the valuation of vessels, as they do to any other personal or real property. The assessor should consider the three approaches to value, the cost, comparative sales, and income approaches, when determining the market value of a vessel. Although the approaches to value are similar, the assessment of vessels and other personal property differ significantly from real property in that the market value of personal property must be estimated on the lien date every year. Unlike real property, personal property (with the exception of manufactured homes (mobilehomes) and floating homes with permanent utility connections) is not governed by the base year value limitations of article XIII A of the California Constitution. The market value of vessels, like all other types of property, is defined in section 110, subdivision (a): .... the amount of cash or its equivalent that property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other, and both the buyer and the seller have knowledge of all of the uses and purposes to which the property is adapted and for which it is capable of being used, and of the enforceable restrictions upon those uses and purposes. Full cash value, or fair market value, of a vessel as concluded by the appraiser on the lien date is unrelated to its net book value (capitalized cost less depreciation) reflected on an assessee's books. Any similarity is merely coincidental.  APPROACHES  TO  VAL  UE  Property Tax Rule 3, Valuation Approaches, which applies to both real and personal property, discusses five approaches to value. The three major appraisal approaches for estimating value (cost, comparative sales, and income), as discussed in Rule 3 regarding real property, are applicable to personal property, including vessels. Although all three approaches to value should be considered, the use of all three may not always be appropriate. The nature of property, its market, and the availability of data will normally indicate which approach(es) is most applicable. This is supported by Rule 3, which states in part: In estimating value as defined in section 2, the assessor shall consider one or more of the following [approaches to value], as may be appropriate for the property being appraised. (Italics added.) Often only one approach is feasible and the appraiser should analyze all available information to determine the most applicable and reliable approach. The courts recognize this fact and the California Supreme Court has stated that:  AH 576  11  February 2002   Chapter 3  Assessors generally estimate value by analyzing market data on sales of similar property, replacement costs, and income from the property ..., and since no one of these methods alone can be used to estimate the value of all property, the assessor, subject to requirements of fairness and uniformity, may exercise his discretion in using one or more of them.17  COST APPROACH One method of the cost approach estimates the value of an asset or a group of assets as the original or historical cost of the asset (or group of assets), adjusted to account for changes in value since purchase and/or installation. It is the method of valuation most frequently relied on when no reliable sales data is available. Replacement cost new, in the case of a new or nearly new vessel and when considered along with normal depreciation, will be a strong indication of market value in the case of vessels that continue to be manufactured. As vessels grow older, however, an estimate of depreciation is less predictable and the accuracy of this approach diminishes. The cost approach method typically used by assessors estimates the value of a vessel based on its original or historical cost. When a vessel of any type is new or nearly new, this approach may be a good representative of market value, provided the original cost was an arms length transaction representing fair market value. In the case of older pleasure boats, the cost approach is generally not used due to the availability of nationally published value guides that provide annual market values based on a large collection of sales data. There are no published value guides for commercial boats (e.g., fishing boats, freighters, research vessels), in which case, an appraiser typically relies on the cost approach for valuation, even in the case of an older vessel. New large vessels or vessels built by little known manufacturers should be valued by the cost approach. Unlike automobiles and airplanes, which have comparatively few manufacturers, there are many manufacturers of vessels and their products may be delivered in various stages of completion. In most cases, an appraiser will have to make a physical survey of the subject vessel and should be knowledgeable about the costs of constructing such a vessel. The cost of the vessel reported by the taxpayer may not include the total cost of such components as engines, electronics, the interior, and other equipment. An appraiser must review the original delivery contract or invoice showing all listed equipment and all invoices for equipment added after delivery.  COMPARATIVE SALES APPROACH The comparative sales approach may be defined as any approach that uses direct evidence of the market's opinion of value of a property. It is based upon the principle of substitution; that is, the fair market value of an item is closely and directly related to the sale prices of comparable, competitive properties. This approach presumes that the value of a property will approximate the selling prices, offers, opinions of owners and appraisers, and appraisals of competitive substitutes. Listing prices will generally set the upper limit of value. 17  De Luz Homes, Inc. v. County of San Diego (1955) 45 Cal.2d 546, 563-564. 12 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 3  Sale prices of comparable properties provide an indication of what the market is willing to pay for that type of property at a specific time. For personal property such as vessels, nationally published value guides that reflect the going market price for comparable vessels can be used as the basis for determining market value when no direct sale comparables in the subject's market area are found. Adjustments should be made when the condition or equipment of the subject vessel is above or below the standard of the base price given on a value guide. Another adjustment to consider is the location of the subject vessel. The base price shown in the vessel price guides may reflect values in a specific region and the appraiser should adjust the value for regional differences as suggested in the guide. Sales tax, an element of value, is not included in the values shown in any of the value guide books and the appropriate tax should be added to the listed value to arrive at full cash value for property tax purposes.18 If applicable, freight and transportation charges should also be considered. The addition of taxes, freight, and transportation charges to the list price of a vessel is consistent with an appraisal approach that gives consideration to the consumer's total cost in arriving at market value. Furthermore, it is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. The cost of any asset includes purchase price, sales tax, brokerage commission, duties, transportation and all costs of placing an asset in a condition for use. However, when a new vessel is purchased, these additional charges, if applicable, are not included in the DMV's reported purchase price. Since an owner has the sales tax, freight, and transportation information readily available from the invoice, the owner should include these charges in the property statement and the appraiser needs to consider them to arrive at the market value of a vessel. As mentioned in the cost approach section above, new, large, custom vessels, and vessels built by little known manufacturers should be valued by the cost approach, unless reliable sales data is available. Such vessels previously owned can be accurately valued by the comparative sales approach; however, the appraiser must be familiar with the vessels being compared. In most cases, the appraiser will have to make a physical survey of the subject vessel and compare it to others on the market. Finding comparable sales of large vessels may be difficult, as there is a reluctance among buyers, sellers, and brokers to divulge accurate sales information. When reliable comparables are available, whether from sales found in the local market place, published value guides, or other sources, the comparative sales approach may be preferable to other value approaches. The following is an example where such sales are available and the vessel's value is determined using the comparative sales approach as discussed in this section.  18  Xerox Corp. v. Orange County (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 746. 13 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 3  USE  OF THE  3.1 COMPARATIVE SALES APPROACH AMPLE  EX  John Jetski purchased a new 1990 Bayliner boat with 110 HP mercury engine and trailer in 1990 for $15,000. On the 2001 lien date, this boat was located in the county and was assessable. The following information was available to and gathered by the appraiser:     The assessee is planning to sell the boat to his brother next month for $1,000 because he is moving out of state. A similar boat (with trailer) was seen advertised in the local newspaper for $9,000. Research in two separate value guides found a value range from $6,500 to $8,000 for this particular boat in average condition. An inspection of the boat and a conversation with the assessee found the boat to be in average condition for its age.  The assessee argues that the boat's value is $1,000. USIN G THE COMPARATIVE SALES APPROACH TO VALUE, WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED TAXABLE VALUE OF THIS VESSEL?  The estimated taxable value of the boat is between $6,500 - $8,000 using two, separate, used-boat value guides. The assessee's estimate of value, $1,000, does not represent market value because it is not an arm's length transaction, has not occurred under normal circumstances, and is not a ""sale"" (the sale has not occurred yet). The appraiser in this case estimates the value at $7,500, which includes sales tax.  Sources of Information When using the comparative sales approach to value vessels, data sources available include DMV records, published value guides, and the Internet. DMV Records As of March 2001, there were approximately 913,000 vessels registered in California through the Department of Motor Vehicles. In 2000, approximately 98,000 used vessels were transferred and 38,000 new vessels were registered. These transfers provide good sales data for many vessels. The sales data on new vessel registrations is fairly accurate as dealers report this information. For the most part, sales data for used vessels may not be as accurate as that for new vessels because buyers report these transactions to the DMV at the time of registration. Even if a sale contract is offered as proof, such documentation is insufficient in determining whether or not a sale is an arm's length transaction.  AH 576  14  February 2002   Chapter 3  Internet The Internet is also a useful tool in establishing the market value of larger vessels. Various web sites, as listed in Appendix D, provide current listings of vessels for sale. Other listings may be found in numerous boating magazines, such as Sea, Latitude 38, Boating World, etc. Some of these magazines have classified advertisements on the Internet as well. Value Guides Published value guides list models of vessels built by known manufacturers. Some include list prices and recommended depreciation schedules. There are three primary value guidebooks that most boat dealers, appraisers, owners, and sellers refer to when determining the market value of pleasure boats and houseboats. These are the BUC Used Boat Price Guide, the ABOS Marine Blue Book, and the National Automobile Dealers Association Marine Appraisal Guide (N.A.D.A.).19 The listed market values or ranges reported in each of these books will vary; therefore, it is good practice to utilize more than one value guidebook when determining the market value of a particular vessel. It is important for an appraiser to be aware of what the values listed in each book represent and to know what adjustments, if any, are required to that value. An appraiser should be familiar with the instructions of a particular guide book, to ensure proper use of the guide book before proceeding. BUC Used Boat Price Guide An appraiser should read the Introduction and How to Use This Book sections of this guide book from time to time. Reading these sections is essential for the first time or infrequent users. Simply turning to a page and referencing a price without regard to ""Area, Equipment, and Condition Scales"" may result in a misusage and may be detrimental to the value estimate. The basic concept of the BUC Price Guide is that the price under the ""Retail High"" column represents the price at which the maximum number of sales will take place but does not represent the highest price an owner may receive for the vessel. It is the projected value that will occur with the highest frequency. The ""Retail Low"" is a percentile whereby 70% to 80% of all boat sales will be located between it and the ""Retail High."" Typically, the range difference between the retail high and the retail low is 8% to 16%, with most being around 10%. The BUC Price Guide does not report the highest and lowest prices reported, because the range in dollars would be so great as to have no practical value. The narrower the range between the statisticallyderived retail high and low, the firmer the price on the vessel. An appraiser must also consider necessary adjustments to the base price shown for area and condition. Adjustment percentages are provided on the reverse side of the front cover of the price guide. ABOS Marine Blue Book Values in the ABOS Blue Book differ from those found in the BUC Used Boat Price Guide because they represent estimated ""low"" and ""high"" wholesale average trade-in values, rather than average selling prices of a vessel. The last column in the book is the ""Code"" column, which is the estimated average resale or retail price (excluding options), which may be closer in value to 19  In addition to these price guides, the Kelley Blue Book Motorcycle Guide, or its interactive web site at www.kbb.com, can also be used for pricing personal watercraft. AH 576 15 February 2002   Chapter 3  those shown in the BUC Price Guide. Adjustments should be made for conditions above or below the ""good-average"" base condition as well as for those vessels loaded with optional or custom equipment; this guide book, however, does not provide for any location adjustments. The guide book also includes a column indicating the manufacturer's suggested retail price new, excluding shipping charges and/or options. This book is useful to a dealer who may want to show his or her customer the estimated retail price new and ""high"" and ""low"" trade-in values without disclosing the estimated resale value that is coded in the last column of the book. As in the BUC Price Guide, an appraiser should be knowledgeable as to the format of the book before a value is placed on a particular vessel. N.A.D.A. The National Automobile Dealers Association publishes a Consumer Marine Appraisal Guide. The range of values listed in this guide reflects the most current information available and is based on a boat's equipment and overall condition. Highly customized or reconditioned vessels can be worth substantially more than the values listed in the guide book (N.A.D.A. has an Optional Equipment Section located at the rear of the guide). Conversely, a neglected vessel can be worth considerably less. An appraiser should be well aware of a vessel's overall interior, exterior, and mechanical condition, any optional equipment, as well as its use in fresh water or salt water to properly arrive at a market value. Vessels used exclusively in salt water, that are not maintained and cleansed with fresh water, may depreciate more rapidly. Such vessels may be 10% to 15% lower than the value stated in this guide. Popularity of a certain manufacturer or model in a particular area should also be considered as this may impact value. The N.A.D.A. Guide, like the ABOS Blue Book, provides for an average trade-in value under the ""used trade-in"" column. This value represents a clean vessel ""ready for resale"" and may be considered the low book value. The next price column is the average retail value of a vessel in a clean, running condition with no visible damage or defects, showing some moderate wear and tear with minor cosmetic or mechanical work needed. The ""high retail"" in the last column reflects those vessels in excellent condition with an engine in good condition. In the January and April editions only, the pricing in italics under the high retail column is the manufacturers' suggested retail pricing (MSRP), or the approximate price of the vessel when brand new. This price assists in the financing, insuring, and appraising of vessels. The N.A.D.A. Guide also has cross-reference sections for model-to-manufacturer if only the model name or if only the hull identification number is known, but the manufacturer is not. Pricing on a specific vessel is also available on the Internet. See Appendix D for the web site. Valuation of Pleasure Boats Many assessors record the initial purchase price of a new or used vessel as market value if it falls within the range of one of the pricing guides. If for no apparent or discernable reason the reported purchase price is significantly lower than the value indicated by the pricing guide(s), a value is determined from the pricing guide. Once the initial value is set, the practice for some assessors has been for future assessments to be annually reduced by a fixed depreciation rate. While this method of determining subsequent market value is administratively convenient and  AH 576  16  February 2002   Chapter 3  simplifies the assessment process, an arbitrary value reduction to all pleasure boats may or may not lead to market value. The use of a ""blanket"" depreciation factor does not conform to good appraisal practice. A better method is for the assessor to annually appraise all vessels at market value using a valuation guide or by deriving trend factors from the market by using the value guides. Trends can be developed by categorizing pleasure boats into two groups  new and used. These groups can then be further subdivided into subgroups (e.g., houseboat, cruiser, sailboat, inboard, outboard, and personal watercraft), as noted in the valuation guides. Trends in market values for these groups can be determined by comparing published boat valuation guides for the current and previous year. Once trend factors are computed, either for appreciation or depreciation, they can be applied to all boats within each group and subgroup. Application of trend factors for determining vessel values may not represent market value in specific instances. As such, the appraiser may need to review some vessels on a case by case basis and adjust the values where appropriate. Valuation of Yachts, Tugboats, Barges, and Other Commercial Vessels In addition to locating the market value of a yacht from a yachts, especially larger, custom yachts, may be compared various Internet sites (see Appendix D for some specific web of vessels available for sale, they will typically represent the vessel. nationally published guide, some to listings of vessels available on sites). Since these are only listings upper end of value for a particular  Marcon International, Inc., a leading vessel and barge consulting and brokerage company to the offshore petroleum, towing, and marine construction industries, publishes a quarterly newsletter. Past and present information from the newsletter is now posted on the Internet. This publication, along with Marcon's web site has a wealth of information concerning tugboats, barges, and other commercial vessels. Current and past market conditions for the different types of vessels (utility, tug boat, tank barge, crew boat, etc.) are separately analyzed and reported. An appraiser may find the current listings section helpful in estimating a specific vessel's value. One feature of the web site includes a daily updated, searchable database to find information on listed vessels or barges. While the web site includes a section with sales information, which provides the specifications and history of the vessel and perhaps the names of the buyer and seller, no sales prices are indicated. Copies of the printed Marcon Newsletter can be downloaded from its web site. Additionally, articles and information may be searched, viewed, or printed based on the topic of interest.  AH 576  17  February 2002   Chapter 3  INCOME APPROACH The income approach to value includes any method of converting an anticipated income stream into a present value estimate. The income approach is generally of little assistance in valuing vessels for several reasons:  A business dependent upon the use of vessels may be shown to benefit from the vessels because of their use, but this is unlikely to be an indication of value for any particular vessel. One model of a vessel may have different full-time commercial or pleasure applications and the income approach might indicate different values for the same model, depending upon its use. The income approach relies on information concerning income and expenses on the vessel being valued. To determine the capitalization rate of the vessel, net income information from the operations of other similar vessels sold would also be required. Cooperation from owners regarding such data is limited at best. Furthermore, there are no published sources with regards to market income information on vessels where an appraiser may gather such data. If an appraiser does happen to collect good data, he or she must then analyze it to determine if the information is typical of the market for that particular vessel.      REASSESSM  ENT  DUE  TO  M  ISFORTUNE OR  CALAM  ITY  Section 170 provides for any taxable property to be eligible for reassessment if it has been damaged or destroyed by no fault of the owner. As such, vessels damaged or destroyed by a misfortune or calamity would be subject to the relief provisions of this section, if the county has adopted an ordinance pursuant to section 170, subdivision (a). The provisions of section 170, however, do not provide any authority for considering a salmon or other fishing drought a disaster entitling owners of commercial fishing vessels to assessment relief. See the discussion of this subject in Chapter 4.  AH 576  18  February 2002   Chapter 4  CHAPTER 4: DOCUMENTED VESSELS DEFIN ITION  The term ""documented vessel"" has a dual meaning. According to the United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard)20 and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), a documented vessel is one that is required to have and does have a valid marine document issued by the Coast Guard. Such a vessel is considered to have federal registration. For California property tax purposes, a required to have and does have a valid documented yachts of the United States, Motor Vehicles. A ""documented vessel"" subdivision (l) of section 3 of article XIII ""documented vessel"" is defined as any vessel that is marine document issued by the Coast Guard,21 except or is registered with, or licensed by, the Department of does not include any vessel exempt from taxation under of the California Constitution.  It is important to understand both definitions of this term for purposes of applying the vessel situs statutes. A documented vessel, for California property tax purposes then, is a vessel with a valid marine document nationally registered with the U.S. Coast Guard or one registered or licensed by the State of California through the DMV. Although documented by the Coast Guard, vessels of more than 50 tons burden and engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers are not subject to the same statutes and guidelines set forth for other documented vessels, as they are wholly exempt from taxation. See the discussion of exemptions in Chapter 6.  DMV REGIS  TRATION AND  NUM  BERING  Every vessel using the waters of this state must be numbered by the Department of Motor Vehicles except when a valid number issued pursuant to federal law (i.e., U.S. Coast Guard document) or a federally approved numbering system of another state already exists.22 Assessments are made and taxes are paid to the county in which the vessel is registered. The area of usage or storage is not the criteria for the taxation for vessels registered by the DMV. Vehicle Code section 9873 provides that vessels are not required to be numbered in the following situations:  The vessel is already covered by a number in full force and effect that has been issued to it pursuant to federal law or a federally approved numbering system of another state; provided, however, that the undocumented vessel will become subject to the numbering requirements of the Vehicle Code if the vessel changes its state of principal use and is within the state for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days.  20 21  The United States Coast Guard is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Section 130, subdivision (b); although this section refers to the United States Bureau of Customs, the United States Coast Guard has succeeded that agency for this responsibility. 22 Vehicle Code section 9850. AH 576 19 February 2002   Chapter 4       The vessel is from a country other than the United States, temporarily using the waters of the state. The vessel is a public vessel of the United States, another state or subdivision thereof or a municipality of such other state. The vessel is a ship's lifeboat; a dinghy is not a lifeboat. Any vessel belonging to a class of boats which has been exempted from numbering if the DMV has determined that the numbering of such a class of vessel will not materially aid in their identification. Such exempt vessels would include undocumented vessels propelled solely by oars or paddles and undocumented vessels eight feet or less propelled solely by sail.  Other vessels that do not require numbering are vessels brought into California for racing purposes only (exempted only during races and tune-ups) and non-motorized surfboards propelled by a sail and with a mast that must be held upright by the operator.  COAST GUARD RE  GISTRATION AND  NUM  BERING  Vessel documentation by the U.S. Coast Guard is a national form of registration, one of the oldest functions of federal government, dating back to the 11th Act of the First Congress. Such documentation provides conclusive evidence of nationality for international purposes, provides for unhindered commerce between the states, and admits vessels to certain restricted trades, such as coastwise trade and the fisheries on navigable waters of the United States or in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),23 unless the vessel is exempt from documentation. Coastwise trade is generally defined as the transportation of merchandise or passengers between points in the United States or the EEZ. In addition, towboats operating between points in the U.S. or the EEZ or between the EEZ and points in the U.S. and dredges operating in the U.S. or the EEZ must be documented.24 Currently, to federally register a vessel, vessel owners must apply for a Certificate of Documentation or the renewal of a Certificate of Documentation with the National Vessel Documentation Center in Falling Waters, West Virginia. To register a vessel at the state level, owners apply at the DMV for a Certificate of (CF number). California law requires current registration of most vessels; however, discussion above for vessels not required to be registered. This includes vessels that are whether or not they are used. The DMV will also record where a vessel is habitually but its location is not indicated on the registration slip. Number see the moored, moored,  The Exclusive Economic Zone is a zone in which the United States claims economic jurisdiction over coastal waters for fishing rights pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 24 Code of Federal Regulations, section 67. AH 576 20 February 2002  23   Chapter 4  ELIGIBLE VESSELS A vessel is eligible for a Coast Guard Certificate of Documentation if it is at least five net tons,25 and with the exception of certain oil spill response vessels, it must be wholly owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States, although certain exceptions may apply. This includes, but is not limited to, a vessel that is used exclusively for recreational purposes and a vessel used in foreign trade.26 Although not required, pleasure vessels over five net tons are often federally documented. Virtually, all large yachts are documented in this manner.  VESSELS REQUIRING DOCUMENTATION A Certificate of Documentation is required for any vessel of at least five net tons that engages in the fisheries of the navigable waters of the United States or in the EEZ, Great Lakes trade, or coastwise trade, unless exempt. Exempt vessels are discussed in the following subsection of this chapter. The Certificate of Documentation must bear a valid endorsement appropriate for the activity in which the vessel is engaged.27 As mentioned above, U.S. Coast Guard documented vessels are now registered at the National Vessel Documentation Center in Falling Waters, West Virginia. There is no longer a California vessel documentation office, as the last one in Long Beach was closed in 1995. Applications for a Certificate of Documentation, renewals, replacements, etc. are processed in West Virginia. Information and forms are available at the U.S. Coast Guard web site28 or by telephoning the Documentation Center. Documented vessels are identified by a unique combination of a name and a hailing port that must be painted on the stern. For vessels initially documented prior to 1995, when documentation centers were located in California, Certificates of Documentation indicate a ""home port,"" that is, the port nearest the domicile of the owner, or where the vessel is habitually moored. This was typically the taxing jurisdiction of the vessel. However, for vessels documented since 1995, a ""hailing port"" designation has taken the place of a ""home port"" designation on the certificate. A hailing port, unlike a home port, may be any city or place within the United States that the owner chooses; it does not have to be where the owner is domiciled. Decal stickers are issued for annual certificate renewals, which are placed on the original certificate of documentation. An assessor can determine whether or not a specific vessel is currently documented via an Internet site.29 The search may be based on a vessel's name or the U.S. Coast Guard identification (document) number.  25  Vessels at least five net tons are typically those over 25 feet in length. During the documentation process, however, verification of a vessel's gross and net tons is required. 26 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 46, section 67.5. 27 CFR, Title 46, section 67.7. 28 www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/vdoc/nvdc.htm. 29 www.st.nmfs.gov/commercial/index.html. AH 576 21 February 2002   Chapter 4  VESSELS EXCLUDED FROM OR EXEMPT FROM DOCUMENTATION The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 46, section 67.9 excludes or exempts the following vessels from Coast Guard documentation: (1) A vessel of less than five net tons is excluded. (2) A vessel, even though over five net tons, which does not operate on the navigable waters of the United States or in the fisheries in the EEZ is exempt. (3) A non-self-propelled the requirement to be is within a harbor, on on the internal waters vessel qualified to engage in the coastwise trade is exempt from documented with a coastwise endorsement, if the coastwise trade the rivers or lakes (except the Great Lakes) of the United States, or or canals of any state.  (4) A vessel exempt from the requirement to be documented by (2) or (3) above may be documented at the option of the owner, provided the vessel meets the other requirements of documentation.  ENDORSEMENTS A Certificate of Documentation may be issued for any or all of the endorsements as summarized below. Complete requirements of each endorsement may be found in the CFR, Title 46, sections 67.17, 67.19, 67.21, and 67.23.   Recreational - A recreational endorsement entitles a vessel to pleasure use only, including bare-boat charter. A vessel with this endorsement may be foreign-built or foreign-owned. Coastwise - A coastwise endorsement entitles a vessel to employment in coastwise trade, dredging, towing, and any other employment for which a fishery endorsement is not required. This endorsement is for commercial waters only. A vessel with this endorsement must be U.S. built and U.S. citizens. unrestricted registry or use in U.S. owned by    Registry - A registry endorsement entitles a vessel to employment in the foreign trade and any other employment for which a coastwise or fishery endorsement is not required.

Fishery Federal registry to land must be - A fishery endorsement entitles a vessel to employment in the fisheries, subject to and State laws regulating the fisheries, and in any other employment for which a or coastwise endorsement is not required. A fishery endorsement entitles a vessel its catch, wherever caught, in the United States. A vessel with this endorsement U.S. built and owned by U.S. citizens.    Any documented vessel may be used for recreational purposes, regardless of its endorsement, but a vessel documented with a recreational endorsement only may not be used for any other purpose.  AH 576  22  February 2002   Chapter 4  QUA  LIFYING  VESSE  LS FOR THE  PREF  ERENTIAL  4 PERCENT ASSESSM  ENT  Pursuant to section 227 and Rule 151, certain documented vessels are assessed at 4 percent of their full cash value, which amounts to a virtual exemption. This preferential assessment is not automatic and the exemption is allowed only if appropriate forms are filed on a timely basis. Per section 227, vessels qualifying for the reduced assessment are documented vessels that are engaged or employed exclusively in any of the following: (a) In the taking and possession of fish or other living resource of the sea for commercial purposes. (b) In instruction or research studies as an oceanographic vessel. (c) In carrying or transporting seven or more people for hire for commercial passenger fishing purposes and holds a current certificate of inspection issued by the United States Coast Guard. A vessel shall not be deemed to be engaged or employed in activities other than the carrying or transporting of seven or more persons for hire for commercial passenger fishing purposes by reason of that vessel being used occasionally for dive, tour, or whale watching purposes. For purposes of this subdivision, ""occasionally"" means 15 percent or less of the total operating time logged for the immediately preceding assessment year. To qualify for the 4 percent preferential assessment, the vessel need not be owned by the taxpayer, but only used for one of the purposes set forth in section 227. If the vessel is leased out on the lien date and the lessee utilizes the vessel for the purposes set forth in this statute, the lessor or lessee should apply for the preferential assessment. Vessels need not be documented in a California port to qualify for the 4 percent special assessment. Such a requirement would result in an unjustified discrimination between residents owning fishing vessels documented in California and residents owning such vessels documented in other states.30 The operation of fishing boats registered in other states in no way differs from that of boats registered in California. Both must satisfy the same licensing requirements and obey the same regulations as to the amount of catch within state waters.  NUMBER OF DAYS USED The number of days that a vessel is used for the specific purposes set forth in section 227, in order to qualify for this preferential assessment, is not, in and of itself, determinative for qualification. If a commercially-licensed vessel's log shows it had been used for only 20 days during the year for fishing purposes and the balance of the year it was purportedly tied up in its slip and the assessor has no documentation of other usage, the vessel may be allowed the 4 percent assessment. If, however, the assessor feels that the actual use is not economic, he should determine if the number of days was limited due to some specific cause (e.g., an inability to obtain charters due to excessive competition or a poor fishing season) or simply 30  Haman v. County of Humboldt (1973) 8 Cal.3d 922. 23 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 4  because the owner chose to limit the use of the vessel. The assessor should base his decision on what is discovered from an investigation, keeping in mind that the vessel needs to be actually engaged in commercial fishing and not merely fishing for three weeks in order to get a 4 percent assessment on the vessel. There is no requirement that a vessel be used an ""x"" number of days for the purposes in which it is being exempted; nor is there a requirement in section 227, subdivision (a) that an ""x"" number of fish must be caught. The key to allowing this preferential assessment is the exclusivity of the vessel's usage for commercial fishing purposes or for studies as an oceanographic vessel during the immediately preceding assessment year. Any other use would disqualify the vessel from receiving the 4 percent assessment, except in the case of section 227, subdivision (c), where a vessel may be used 15 percent or less of its total operating time during the prior assessment year for dive, tour, or whale watching purposes.  QUALIFYING UNDER SECTION 227, SUBDIVISION (a) To qualify for the 4 percent preferential assessment, the vessel itself need not be highly mobile. It need only be a watercraft used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water and exclusively engaged or employed in the taking and possession of living resources of the sea for commercial purposes. This section of the statute does not require the ""living resource of the sea"" be a ""natural resource""; therefore, artificially-planted oysters may be considered a living resource of the sea. It does not matter that the oysters are ""planted"" and cultured in cages hung from barges anchored at sea; therefore, vessels that are engaged in seeding the oyster beds and in harvesting artificially planted oysters qualify for the 4 percent preferential assessment. Examples of other vessels exempt under this provision include tow vessels used in hauling the vessels that seed and harvest the oysters as well as power driven barges used to lift oyster cages for cleaning and harvesting. Vessels used to facilitate the pumping of sea water to inland oyster beds or vessels anchored inland to facilitate the pumps which draw in sea water, both for the purpose of supplying ""food"" to the oysters, also qualify for the preferential assessment. The sea water brought inland is considered food for the oysters; sea water is a living resource of the sea and it is taken for commercial purposes. On the other hand, inland vessels used to carry oyster cages would not qualify because the element of ""taking from the sea"" is absent.  QUALIFYING UNDER SECTION 227, SUBDIVISION (b) In qualifying for the preferential assessment under section 227, oceanographic instructional or research vessel is not required to have The exemption is not a charitable exemption; thus the profit potential of affect the vessel's eligibility for the exemption.

This is the case even if a vessel is documented prior to completion, or documented when completed, and thereafter used in the manner prescribed by section 227. According to an opinion of the Attorney General, a vessel cannot be said to be engaged in commercial fishing while it is being built. Section 227 clearly provides two requirements for exemption: a vessel must be documented and it must be engaged in the exempt activity. Enrollment and licensing (e.g., the documentation) are not enough. To qualify for the exemption, a vessel would, at the very least, have to be in the water, outfitted, and ready to actually engage in the qualifying activity (i.e., commercial fishing operations).31 Vessels under construction by a shipbuilder, however, would be exempt as business inventory, as such vessels are held for sale in the ordinary course of business.  EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS Not only does the 4 percent preferential assessment apply to the vessel, but it also applies to equipment and furnishings normally required on board.32 Equipment includes navigational, radio, radar, and sonar equipment, winches, anchors, lifeboats, generators, and other such operational equipment, as well as necessary fishing or scientific equipment. Such equipment necessary for the accomplishment of the vessel's functions is subject to the special assessment even though it is stored ashore during off-season periods. Furnishings qualifying for the special assessment include stoves, dishes, chairs, fire extinguishers, athletic or recreational equipment, and other property necessary for the comfort and convenience of the persons on board.33 If any such equipment or furnishings are leased, the lessor should apply for the preferential assessment of the equipment, if leased on the lien date, provided that this occurs in the ordinary course of business. The 4 percent assessment is not available for property necessary to maintain or service a vessel or the equipment and furnishings not normally required on board. Such items include cranes affixed to the dock and used to load and unload the vessel's cargo, shore radio equipment used in communicating with the vessel, and scientific equipment used ashore in processing data compiled by a research vessel.  DISASTER RELIEF The provisions of section 170, regarding assessment relief due to property damage caused by a major misfortune or calamity, do not provide any authority for considering a salmon or other fishing drought a disaster entitling owners of commercial fishing vessels to assessment relief. If the owner of a fishing vessel discontinues his commercial fishing operations due to a decline in the availability of fish and the vessel is used for activities other than those enumerated 31 32  54 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 98, 102; see also Favalora v. County of Humboldt (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 969. Rule 151 of Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations. (All rule references in this section of the handbook refer to the Property Tax Rules in Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations.) 33 Ibid. AH 576 25 February 2002   Chapter 4  in section 227, the preferential assessment cannot be extended to the non-qualifying use under the terms of the disaster relief provisions. On the other hand, if a vessel is temporarily laid up or out of service due to the fishing drought and does not engage in activities other than those allowed in section 227, a vessel may continue to qualify for the preferential assessment.  AFFIDAVIT FOR 4 PERCENT ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN VESSELS (BOE-576-E) Anyone claiming the classification of a vessel as a documented vessel eligible for the preferential assessment shall submit to the assessor an Affidavit for 4 Percent Assessment of Certain Vessels,34 Form BOE-576-E. The filing date for this form is between the lien date, January 1, and February 15, 5 p.m.35 The affidavit requires that certain documentation be attached for its approval. Affidavits for vessels qualifying under section 227, subdivision (b) (research vessels) shall have the contract, statement, or agreement from the respective organization outlining the nature of the research and the time duration attached to the affidavit. In addition to the research documents, a copy of the Certificate of Documentation shall be attached to the affidavit. The Certificate will indicate the vessel's official classification as an oceanographic research vessel. If the vessel was used in the manner prescribed by the statute, physically met the classification requirements on the lien date, and the taxpayer has timely filed the affidavit, delay in obtaining the supporting formal classification should not disqualify the vessel for the 4 percent preferential assessment. The assessor should accept the supplementary documents even when supplied after the filing period deadline. Affidavits for vessels qualifying under section 227, subdivision (c) should have a copy of either the Certificate of Inspection, Form CG3753, or Temporary Certificate of Inspection, Form CG854, attached. The assessor should review the Coast Guard certificate to ensure the January 1 lien date falls within the inspection date and the 4 percent assessment should only be approved if it does. The Certificate of Inspection for most passenger vessels is valid for a 5-year period, except for vessels carrying more than 12 passengers on international voyages, which require annual inspections. When a re-inspection on a five-year certificate is due just prior to the lien date, but has not been completed by the lien date, the assessor should remind the claimant of the Coast Guard's 90-day limit for re-inspection after the due date. A suspension of the certificate will otherwise occur and the claimant should be informed that the affidavit will not be processed unless the owner provides proof of re-inspection by submitting a copy of the Certificate of Inspection to the assessor within the 90-day allowance period. Late Filing Assessment Reduction If a claimant fails to file the affidavit by 5 p.m. on February 15, but files it on or before August 1, the assessment shall be reduced in a sum equal to 80 percent of the reduction that would have  34 35  Section 254. Section 255. 26 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 4  been allowed had the affidavit been timely filed.36 assessment calculation: EX ASSESSMENT AMPLE FOR  The following example illustrates this  4.1 AFFIDAVIT LATE FILI  NG  Assume a vessel has a market value of $100,000 on the lien date of January 1 and is used commercial fishing purposes. The owner fails to file the 4 percent assessment affidavit February 15 of the same calendar year. The assessor enrolls a $100,000 market value, and a bill is sent. The owner then files the affidavit by August 1. The assessment reduction would calculated as follows: Assessed value on January 1 roll Assessed value (4% of market value) if affidavit was filed by February 15 Assessed value reduction had the affidavit been filed by February 15 Assessed value reduction due to the affidavit being filed after February 15, but by August 1 (80% of $96,000) Assessment on the roll Reduction, as calculated above Revised Assessed Value Another method of calculating the revised assessed value: Assessed value if affidavit were filed by February 15 Add 20% of difference between $100,000 and $4,000 ($96,000 x 20%) Revised Assessed Value $ 4,000 19,200 $ 23,200 $100,000 < 4,000 > $ 96,000  for by tax be  $ 76,800 $100,000 < 76,800 > $ 23,200  The following table illustrates the assessment and tax liability for the three scenarios of filing the affidavit on time, filing late, or not filing at all. Note that the assessment and consequent tax bill is nearly six times higher for the late filer than it would be had the claim been filed by February 15. Affidavit Filed by February 15 Market Value Taxable Value Taxes @ 1% 36  Affidavit Filed by August 1 $100,000 $23,200 $232  No Affidavit Filed $100,000 $100,000 $1,000  $100,000 $4,000 $40  Section 275.5. 27 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 4  An assessor has no authority to overrule the due dates of an affidavit. The law does not allow the assessor to accept late filings of the affidavit to qualify for either the 4 percent assessment or the reduced assessment. Section 260 provides that if any person claiming any exemption fails to comply with the procedural requirements, the person waives the exemption. A claimant/taxpayer is responsible for the filing of the affidavit and this responsibility is not negated simply because the taxpayer does not receive the form from the assessor. It is not the assessor's responsibility to notify all vessel owners who might qualify for the 4 percent assessment.  NON  DOCUMENTED  VESS  ELS  As with the term ""documented vessel,"" the term ""nondocumented vessel"" has a dual meaning. For purposes of the Coast Guard and the DMV, a nondocumented or undocumented vessel is one that is not required to have a marine document issued by the Coast Guard. For California property tax purposes, a nondocumented vessel is one that is neither documented by the Coast Guard nor registered or licensed by the DMV. However, unless exempt by a county's low value ordinance, such vessels are subject to assessment. Nondocumented vessels include vessels propelled solely by oars or paddles or vessels eight feet or less propelled solely by sail.37 A nondocumented vessel, except a vessel not subject to California property tax due to its status under subdivision (b) or (c) of Vehicle Code section 9873, is a vessel that would not typically require the filing of a property statement. A person owning a vessel that does not require the filing of a property statement shall, however, upon request of the assessor, file a property statement, Form BOE-576-D. See Chapter 2 for the discussion of forms.  37  Vehicle Code section 9873. 28 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  CHAPTER 5: SITUS Situs, the place where property is legally situated, is one of the essential factors of a valid assessment. Section 404 governs the assessment jurisdiction for property and states that: ""All taxable property, except State assessed property, shall be assessed by the assessing agency of the taxing agency where the property is situated."" Since vessels are personal property and mobile, they have no fixed situs. The situs of a vessel may be the same or different from day to day, month to month, or year to year. One of the most important duties of the marine appraiser is to determine a vessel's taxable situs. For property tax purposes, a vessel's taxable situs is established on the January 1 lien date. On the lien date, vessels with a taxable situs located in California are assessable by the taxing agency of the jurisdiction in which they are located. Vessels with a taxable situs located outside of California, almost without exception, are not assessable within the state.  S  ITUS OF SEAGOING  VESS  ELS  / HOME PORT DOCTR  INE  Vessels plying the high seas may constantly move between ports throughout the year. Such vessels are generally bound by the ""home port"" doctrine that permits only the taxing authority of a home port to impose a tax. No other jurisdiction, including those ports visited by the vessel during its voyages, has the power to tax it.38 The ""home port"" doctrine, established under common law, is a doctrine which permits vessels engaged in foreign or interstate commerce to be taxed at the domicile of the owner or at the port of registration regardless of where the vessel actually happens to be located on the lien date. This doctrine has limited application in modern times, as both the United States Supreme Court, in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles,39 and the California Supreme Court, in Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. County of Alameda,40 have described the home port doctrine as anachronistic;41 however, the home port doctrine may be applied to seagoing vessels when no permanent situs has otherwise been established for a vessel. Prior to 1995, owners typically documented these vessels at the port nearest to their place of domicile, which was considered the vessel's taxable situs. Annual renewal of a Certificate continue to show the original ""hailing port,"" as opposed to a "" (see Chapter 4). As a result, the the domicile of the owner. of Documentation for vessels documented prior to 1995 will port of documentation on the certificate. Since 1995, a home port,"" is now used on the Certificate of Documentation taxable situs for seagoing vessels put into service since 1995 is  38 39 40 41  Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co. (1855) 17 How (58 U.S.) 596. 441 U.S. 434, 443 (1979). 12 Cal.3d 772, 786-787 (1974). Both the Japan Line, Ltd. and Sea-Land Service, Inc. cases addressed the taxability of cargo containers. 29 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  The home port doctrine was developed for and applied to the taxation of vessels, as distinguished from the apportionment rule that has been applied to railroad rolling stock and aircraft. In Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co., the United States Supreme Court granted the domiciliary state the power to tax in full and denied the power to tax to all other jurisdictions, regardless of where the vessel happened to be actually located on the lien date. This ruling has been consistently applied to vessels by California courts. Despite the home port designated by an owner, a vessel's home port should be determined by a ship's actual operations and not by the fictitious home port created solely by registry. A home port is to be distinguished from a ""port of convenience"". A port of convenience has no taxing authority as it is a port where a vessel primarily at sea enters temporarily between ocean voyages to deliver goods, obtain provisions, and make repairs.42 If a seagoing vessel is inactive and not engaged in any kind of commerce for a period of time that cannot be considered temporary, however, it acquires a taxable situs where it is anchored or moored, irrespective of any so-called home port.43 Due to the nature of interstate or foreign commerce and travel, the physical presence of a vessel may not establish permanent situs. A vessel may establish a habitual or significant presence at one or more locations. However, unlike some other types of personal property, vessels (other than intercounty ferries) are not subject to apportionment. When sites are temporary, even when a habitual or significant presence is established, taxable situs is not acquired for property tax purposes. The taxable situs of a vessel is not determined by an owner's designation of a home port but depends upon the existence of sufficient contacts, such as the use and employment of a vessel within the jurisdiction and the opportunities, benefits, or protection afforded a vessel by the jurisdiction, to satisfy due process.44 A sea-going vessel, therefore, regardless of whether the vessel has a ""home port"" or a ""hailing port"" designation, can acquire a new taxable situs, if the vessel becomes habitually moored at a new location.  PERM  ANENT VS  . TEM  PORARY SITUS  Permanent versus temporary situs must be considered when determining taxable situs for property tax purposes. Article XIII, section 14, provides that ""[a]ll property taxed by local government shall be assessed in the county, city, and district in which it is situated."" ""Situated"" connotes a more or less permanent location or situs. Thus, the taxation of a vessel must be based on the fact that it is to some extent kept or maintained in California rather than here casually or in transit. This constitutional provision does not refer to the temporary location of property, but to its permanent situs.  42 43 44  Martinac v. County of San Diego (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 175. Continental Dredging Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1973) 366 F.Supp. 1133. County of San Diego v. Lafayette Steel Company (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 690. 30 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  Vessels that are temporarily situated in California on the lien date but have permanent taxable 45 situs outside of California are not assessable in California. On the other hand, vessels documented or registered in California, that are employed in foreign or interstate commerce on the lien date, are assessable in the California jurisdiction where they are habitually moored or where the owners are domiciled. This applies to such vessels even if they have never been within California waters. An exception to this would be if a vessel had, by the manner of its use, acquired an actual situs elsewhere.46 Although moved periodically, vessels are taxable in the jurisdiction where they are normally located. An assessee may have moved his vessel just prior to the lien date, and then immediately moved it back. Although gone on the lien date, the vessel has not established permanent situs elsewhere; therefore, its taxable situs remains at the original location. Simply moving a vessel from one county to another for short periods of time will not preclude an assessment or render an assessment invalid. A vessel may avoid the imposition of taxes at its original location only if it has been permanently removed and has acquired a taxable situs elsewhere. If by the manner of the use of a vessel, the vessel acquires an actual situs other than where it had been previously documented, located, and/or taxed, the situs created by the owner's use of the vessel should be honored. If another California county presents a tax bill to a vessel's owner, the original county where the vessel was previously taxed should defer to the new county claiming situs jurisdiction. It is an owner's burden to provide documentation to an assessor that situs has been established elsewhere, either in another county, state, or country. Such documentation would include a tax bill for the vessel in question by another jurisdiction or other supporting documents. If a tax bill from another jurisdiction is offered as evidence, an assessor should request the bill be marked paid, as an unpaid bill may be canceled after offering it as proof that a vessel has gained a different situs. Mooring rental slips or agreements may also provide evidence of a vessel's situs change; however, many assessors will issue escape assessments if a relocated vessel is sited back at the original location at any time within a period of one year and covering two lien dates. If a vessel has been permanently moved, the vessel is no longer taxable at its original designation, whether or not it is still documented there and whether or not its owners reside within the original taxing jurisdiction. For taxation purposes, a vessel that is completely inoperative is taxed like other tangible property at its permanent location.47 An inoperative vessel, not documented in California or anywhere else, may be taxed here if it has been moored here for a period of time that is not considered temporary, even though the owners do not reside here. Although the owners intend for the vessel to be operated as a seagoing vessel in the future, or to be located elsewhere, such a vessel would be considered permanently located here. 45 46  Sayles v.

AH 576 31 February 2002   Chapter 5  ROL  E OF THE  DE  PARTMENT OF  M  OTOR  VEHICL  ES  Owners of most vessels are required to register their boats with the DMV if not documented by the Coast Guard (see Chapter 4 for details on registration requirements). As stated earlier, vessels registered by the DMV are also considered to be documented vessels for property tax purposes. The DMV maintains a computer information file with an owner's name, address, location of the boat, boat type, cost class, and other pertinent information. When a boat owner sells or moves a boat to a new situs, the owner should notify the DMV, which then subsequently updates its computer file. The DMV is required to transmit information from each initial transfer or renewal application to the assessor in the county where the vessel owner resides and to the assessor in the county where the vessel is principally kept, if not in the same county where the owner resides.48 The DMV also transmits information regarding the destruction or abandonment of a vessel to the county assessor concerned. The DMV typically sends the lists of all boat additions and deletions to the county assessors' offices on a monthly basis. To facilitate the tracking of boat owners and boat location, the DMV also permits assessors' offices to establish an on-line communication link to access its database. The information, however, is not always up-to-date. It is the responsibility of the assessee to keep the county assessor and the DMV informed of any changes of ownership or address, the location of a vessel, or its destruction. Many times owners will not do so, or only after a long delay; but when faced with having to pay a property tax, the information regarding the vessel is generally promptly corrected. The county where the DMV registers a vessel is the place of documentation and is typically the county where the vessel is located and assessed. The address indicated on the registration certificate is the mailing address of the registered owner but it does not indicate where the vessel is habitually moored, which may be different from the owner's mailing address. The DMV stores the situs information in its computer system and passes this information on to the assessor in the reports. If an owner's mailing address is the same as the ""habitually moored"" location of the vessel, then the vessel's situs is the same as the domicile county of the vessel owner. However, if the ""habitually moored"" address is located in a county different from that of the owner's mailing address, then the vessel is assessed where the vessel is habitually moored. The situs information recorded by the DMV is considered the notice of the vessel's habitual place of mooring when not in service. This DMV report provides evidence to the assessor of the county where the owner is domiciled that the vessel is assessed elsewhere, as required by section 1139.  S  ITUS OF  COAST GUARD DOC  UMENTED  VESSELS  The situs of Coast Guard documented vessels depends upon the vessel's federal registration. Prior to 1995, owners typically documented these vessels at the port nearest to their place of domicile, which was considered the vessel's taxable situs. Since 1995, a ""hailing port"" as 48  Vehicle Code section 9869. 32 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  opposed to a ""home port"" is now used on the Certificate of Documentation of vessels. As a result, the taxable situs for vessels put into service since 1995 is the domicile of the owner, unless the taxable situs of a vessel can be determined elsewhere. The taxable situs of a vessel is not determined by the owner's designation of a home port, but depends upon the existence of sufficient contacts between the situs and the vessel to satisfy due process. These contacts include the use and employment of the vessel within the jurisdiction and the opportunities, benefits, or protection afforded the vessel by the jurisdiction.49  S  ITUS OF  NON  DOCUMENTED  VESS  ELS  Nondocumented (or undocumented) vessels, those that do not require registration by the DMV or by the Coast Guard, establish situs in the county where they are habitually moored when not in service.50 Smaller boats that are not habitually kept at a mooring but are lifted from the water and kept in a boathouse or transported by trailers to the owner's residence or another location are taxed at the location where the boat is habitually kept.  S  ITUS OF INTERCOUNTY  FERRYBOATS  The taxable situs of intercounty ferryboats is regulated by statute. When a ferry connects ports in more than one county, it is assessed in equal proportions in each of the counties. The wharves, storehouses, and stationary property ancillary to the ferryboat operation are assessed in the county or counties where they are located.51  RESID  ENCE AND  DOM  ICILE  With consideration to vessel situs, both the terms ""domicile"" and ""residence"" are used with frequency. Generally, ""domicile"" and ""residence"" are distinguished so that ""domicile"" is the one location where a person is considered to have the most settled and permanent connection. It is the place where an individual intends to remain and the place he or she has the intention of returning whenever absent, but which the law may also assign to the owner constructively. ""Residence,"" on the other hand, connotes any factual place of abode of some permanency, more than a mere temporary stay. ""Domicile"" normally is the more comprehensive term, in that it includes both the acts of residency and an intention to remain. A person may have only one domicile at a given time, but may have more than one physical residence separate from their domicile. Statutes, however, do not always make this distinction in the employment of these terms. Thus, for the purposes of tax situs, in virtually every case, ""residence"" and ""domicile"" will be interchangeable.  49 50 51  County of San Diego v. Lafayette Steel Co., supra at page 690. Section 1141. Section 1137. 33 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  For vessels documented since 1995, ordinarily the domicile of an owner is the situs of a vessel for the purpose of taxation. This is subject, however, to the exception where a vessel has acquired an actual situs other than the place of the domicile of the owner.52 For example, a vessel documented through the National Documentation Center, moored in San Diego County, but whose owner is domiciled in Sacramento County would be taxable in San Diego County, the location of its habitual mooring. If an owner purchases and documents a vessel with the DMV in San Diego County and subsequently moves to Sacramento County and stores the vessel at his new domicile, Sacramento County becomes the vessel's situs on the following lien date and upon notification to the assessor in San Diego County. There is no proration of the taxes upon moving.  DOC  UMENTS THAT  AID  IN  DET  ERMINING SITUS  To assist an assessor in determining situs, the assessor may request certain documents from an owner based on applicability. Documents that may be useful include, but are not limited to, the following items:         Slip rental agreements Tax bill, preferably paid, from another county, state, or country Ship's log Port of entry permits Slip rental receipts from foreign country Customs clearance papers Passport or visa United States entry permit or inter-country travel permits  S  UMMARY OF SITUS  DETERMINAT  ION  From the discussion above, the situs of a vessel can be determined in a variety of manners: (1) by where a vessel is documented, located, or taxed; (2) by where a vessel is habitually moored; (3) by the manner of a vessel's use; and (4) by the domicile of the owner. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with a given vessel, the appropriate taxable situs of a vessel can be determined as one of these locations. Additional considerations when determining the situs of a vessel include: (1) vessels documented outside of California, but which are partly or wholly in use in the waters of the state, the owners of which reside in the state, shall be assessed in the state;53 and, (2) when an owner or master of a taxable vessel gives written notice of the vessel's habitual place of mooring when not in service 52 53  Star-Kist Foods, Inc., v. Byram (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 313. Section 1138. 34 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5  to the assessor of the county where the vessel is documented, the vessel becomes assessable in the county where habitually moored.54 Essentially, the situs of a vessel can be determined by whether a vessel is registered by the DMV or documented by the Coast Guard or by whether a vessel is a seagoing vessel. The discussions below indicate the appropriate situs for each of these classifications.  VESSELS REGISTERED BY THE DMV For vessels registered with the DMV, the DMV records situs information of a vessel's habitually moored address. Such location will determine the county that has taxing authority over the vessel. If the DMV records do not include a habitually moored address, the vessel will be taxable in the domicile county of the vessel's owner. Of course, if the taxable situs of a vessel can be determined elsewhere, the vessel should be taxed at that location.  VESSELS DOCUMENTED BY THE COAST GUARD Vessels registered before 1995 have a ""home port"" designation. This location is considered to be the taxable situs for such vessels. Vessels registered since 1995 have a ""hailing port"" designation. The domicile of the owner is considered the taxable situs for such vessels. If a federally registered vessel is habitually moored elsewhere, however, the taxable situs of such a vessel should be established at that location.  SEAGOING VESSELS In general, seagoing vessels (i.e., vessels engaged in foreign and interstate commerce) should be taxed at the domicile of the owner or at the port of registration, regardless of where the vessel happens to be actually located on the lien date. Seagoing vessels are generally federally registered and such registration will determine the taxable situs of these vessels. Vessels registered before 1995 have a ""home port"" designation. This location is considered to be the taxable situs for such vessels. Vessels registered since 1995 have a ""hailing port"" designation. If a sea-going vessel becomes habitually moored elsewhere, the taxable situs of such a vessel should be established at that location.  CHANGE IN SITUS The domicile of an owner, the state of registration, or the designation of a home or hailing port may determine a vessel's taxable situs, except when it can be shown that the vessel is habitually moored elsewhere. The following are occurrences in which a vessel's original situs may yield its taxing authority to another jurisdiction:  A vessel of another that state, domiciled may, by being indefinitely and exclusively employed within the waters state, acquire an actual situs there that will permit the vessel to be taxed in even though the vessel is documented here or that the vessel's owner is in California.  54  Section 1139. 35 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 5     If the vessel is documented outside of the state, but travels regularly in California's waters and the owners reside in this state,55 the vessel is assessable in California. If a vessel owner has permanently moved the vessel from its original designated situs to another location where the vessel has become habitually moored and the owner has so informed the proper assessor in writing.56 If an assessor can show, despite the place of documentation, original situs designation, or a notice that a vessel has been removed, that the vessel is permanently located in his/her county,57 provided the original county indicated that the vessel is not assessed there.    55 56  Section 1138. Section 1139. 57 Article XIII, section 14 of the California Constitution (""...in the county ... in which it is situated"") takes precedence over sections 1139 and 1140 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. AH 576 36 February 2002   Chapter 5  APPLICATION OF SITUS DETERMINATION The following is an example of making a determination of taxable situs for a vessel using the sections and rules described above. The conclusion regarding situs is specific to the information given. EXAMPLE 5.1 SITUS OF VESSEL An assessee/vessel owner purchased a boat on December 1, 2000, and registered it with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) using a mailing address in XYZ County. On February 1, 2001, the assessee filed a vessel property statement with XYZ County using the same address for purposes of registration as the assessee's mailing address and habitual place of mooring. However, on the back of the form, he noted that the boat was now moored in Mexico. To determine situs and taxability, the assessor contacted the assessee and gathered the following information: The boat was purchased in San Jose, California on December 1, 2000. The boat was registered January 1, 2001, and the registration address (in XYZ County) shown was the domicile of the owner's son.  The assessee claims (without documentation) that the boat is now habitually moored in Baja, Mexico, but is unable or unwilling to verify the date or permanent address (situs) of the new habitual mooring location. The situs address on the DMV registration certificate in XYZ County remains unchanged.  Assessee claims permanent domicile in the State of Washington.  The state of Washington will not register vessels without a physical inspection. BASED ON THE FACTS PROVIDED, THE TAXABLE SITUS OF THIS VESSEL ON LIEN DATE JANUARY 1, 2001 IS XYZ COUNTY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS (IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE):  Application for a CF number and registration with the DMV establishes situs for vessels; thus, the taxable situs is XYZ County, since the assessee indicated an XYZ County address as both his mailing address and the place of habitual mooring on the registration for his vessel (section 1139). Under California law: ""Every undocumented vessel using the waters or on the waters of this state shall be currently numbered."" (Vehicle Code section 9850). The assessee's intention was to use the boat in the waters of this state. The assessee stated on the property statement that the boat was located in XYZ County. This statement was signed under penalty of perjury. (The remarks on the back of the form are not sufficient documentation verifying a different situs for the vessel.) If a vessel is (permanently) moved from the registered situs, an owner is required to notify the DMV by changing the address on the registration certificate or by filing another property statement or other documentation notifying the assessor pursuant to section 1139. Since this did not occur, the situs of the vessel for property tax purposes is XYZ County.       AH 576  37  February 2002   Chapter 6  CHAPTER 6: EXEMPTIONS Certain provisions of the California Constitution allow for vessel exemptions, either on a partial or full basis. Article XIII, section 2 of the California Constitution provides that the Legislature may, with two-thirds of each house concurring, classify any personal property for differential taxation or for exemption. Personal property may be exempt from taxation by reason of its ownership, use, and/or type. Full exemptions include vessels having a low value, vessels considered business inventory (including those under construction), vessels of more than 50 tons burden engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers, and certain vessels with a historical value. In addition to these property tax exemptions, certain documented vessels, per the provisions of section 227, are granted the right to be assessed at 4 percent of their full cash value. This preferential treatment, a form of exemption, is discussed in Chapter 4. It is important for the appraiser to be aware of these exemptions to determine the assessability of the vessel being appraised. It is also important to note that not all exemptions are automatic. Similar to other exemptions, a taxpayer has the burden of demonstrating that a vessel qualifies for the exemption. Some exemptions are allowed only if appropriate forms are filed on a timely basis. In such cases, a vessel remains assessable unless an exemption claim is filed by the taxpayer and approved by the county assessor.  VESSELS  WITH  M  ARKET  VAL  UE OF  $400  OR  LESS  Pursuant to section 228, a vessel with a market value of four hundred dollars ($400) or less shall be free from taxation. This exemption only applies to vessels used or held for non-commercial purposes and shall not apply to lifeboats or other vessels used in conjunction with the operation of vessels with a market value of more than $400. In determining the market value of a vessel, a vessel's value should include all equipment such as mode of power and furnishings that are normally required aboard the vessel to accomplish the functions for which the vessel is being utilized. This exemption can only be applied to one vessel owned, claimed, possessed, or controlled by an assessee on the lien date.  COU  NTY  LOW-VALUE ORD  INANCE  As described above, vessels with a market value of four hundred dollars or less are exempt from taxation. Each county's board of supervisors, however, may set its own low value exemption, pursuant to section 155.20. This section states that a county board of supervisors may choose to exempt property with a full value so low that, if not exempt, the taxes would amount to less than the cost of assessing and collecting them. In any case, a county board of supervisors shall have no authority to exempt personal property with a full value of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000).  AH 576  38  February 2002   Chapter 6  VESSELS  WITH  HISTOR  IC  VAL  UE  As of January 1, 2001, wooden vessels of historical significance, and all other personal property thereon used in their operation, are exempt from taxation if all of the following conditions are satisfied:58  The owner and operator is a nonprofit organization that has qualified for exemption under either section 23701(d) of the Revenue and Taxation Code or under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. No part of the net earnings of the owner inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. The vessel is used primarily as, or as a part of, a maritime museum that is regularly open to the public. Income from fundraising use and use for charter activities does not exceed 40 percent of operating revenues of the vessel, and all net earnings are used to further the exempt activity of the museum. To qualify for the exemption, the claimant is required to annually file, by February 15, an affidavit furnished by the assessor.        For the purposes of this statute, ""wooden vessels of historical significance"" is defined as any wooden vessel that is a refurbished original, wooden inland waters vessel of 47 feet or larger, built in California during or prior to 1910, that continuously thereafter has remained in California waters, and that has been designated a California State Historical Landmark.  BUSINESS I  NVENTORIES  Business inventories, as described in section 129 and Property Tax Rule 133, are eligible for exemption from taxation.59 Vessels intended for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business are considered to be business inventories. Vessels under construction, even those under a contract of sale, and the raw materials on hand not yet incorporated into a vessel are also included as business inventories.  PROPERTY HELD FOR LEASE OR CONSIGNMENT Business inventory includes property held for lease or consignment by lessors, sublessors, and consignors. Exemptions allowed, however, are not based solely upon the status of a vessel on the lien date and the assessor should not judge the validity of the business inventory exemption based on that fact alone, but instead look to the true intent of the owner. Individual facts such as a vessel's actual use before and after the lien date, the length of a consignment or lease, and the location of the vessel tend to indicate the owner's intent, but are not singularly controlling. 58 59  Section 230. Section 219. 39 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 6  For example, a vessel that is put up for consignment just prior to the lien date, then removed from consignment shortly thereafter, in an attempt to escape assessment, is ineligible for exemption. To qualify for the business inventory exemption, the owner or lessor must have the intent to actually have the property available for lease or under consignment in accordance with the regular and usual practice and method of the business of the lessor or consignor. The vessel owners are not required to be in the business of selling or leasing vessels, only that the property is so held. The business inventory exemption is available to owners who have validly put their vessel up for consignment to a consignor. On the other hand, a vessel held and advertised for sale by an owner would be ineligible for exemption, unless the owner's normal course of business is selling vessels. The key to qualifying for the business inventory exemption is that the vessel must be held for sale, lease, or consignment in the ordinary course of business of the seller, lessor, or consignor. Marinas in the business of leasing out houseboats may claim the business inventory exemption on repair/replacement parts that are typically rented with the houseboats. Tools and supplies used by the owner for maintenance, however, are assessable.  TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL An enforced idleness or temporary withdrawal from leasing due to conditions such as seasonal weather or maintenance work does not interfere with a vessel's otherwise exempt status. Although a business may be closed for the season and boat rental activity is suspended on the lien date, the business inventory exemption may continue to apply. For instance, if a marina rents out houseboats within its normal course of business but closes this portion of their operations for several months during the winter season that includes the lien date, the vessels normally available for lease continue to qualify for the business inventory exemption. The seasonal closing is an enforced withdrawal, temporary in character, and to disallow the business inventory exemption due to this, would defeat the purpose of the exemption.  PROPERTY USED BY OWNER Business inventory does not include property being used by its owner for any purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property. A vessel held for sale or lease is not allowed the exemption if it has been, or is intended to be, used by the seller or lessor prior to or subsequent to its sale or lease. As such, a boat dealer that enters a racing boat into an occasional race to show its competitiveness is consistent with and an acceptable norm as demonstration and display of the vessel for sale or lease. To enter the boat into numerous racing events, however, would result in use by the owner as other than demonstration and display and would therefore disqualify the vessel for the business inventory exemption. This is in contrast to instances in which a boat held for sale or lease might be raced many times, but all or part of the crew consists of prospective purchasers or lessees; such instances could be construed to be demonstration and display of the vessel.  AH 576  40  February 2002   Chapter 6  Another example of a vessel that is ineligible for the business inventory exemption is one that is used as a demonstration to display marine accessory equipment for sale. Property Tax Rule 133, subsection (b)(2) specifically excludes from exemption property being used by its owner for any purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property. The vessel is being used to display accessory equipment, which is not directly associated with the sale or lease of the boat. Subsection (a)(3) of the rule states in part that to be eligible for exemption, the property must be held and openly offered for sale or lease and must be displayed, advertised, or otherwise brought to the attention of potential purchasers or lessees by means normally employed. Although the vessel may be offered for sale at a later date, it is not offered for sale during the display of marine accessory equipment; therefore, it does not qualify for the business inventory exemption. In such an instance, the vessel becomes eligible for the business inventory exemption only at the time it is offered for sale.  EXEMPTION  FOR  VESS  ELS OF  M  ORE THAN  50 TONS BURDEN  Article XIII, section 3, subdivision (l) of the California Constitution provides that vessels of more than 50 tons burden and engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers are exempt from property taxation. With respect to this provision, ""50 tons burden"" shall mean ""50 tons net burden"" as registered in the United States Customs Office. In Kiessig v. County of San Diego,60 the court determined that it would rely on case law and upon the provision of the federal shipping act which defines ""tonnage,"" being that ""tons burden"" meant ""net tons,"" or ""net register tonnage."" In allowing the exemption, an appraiser should verify the net tonnage on a specific vessel. Certificates of Documentation state the gross and net tonnage of a vessel. An appraiser may also locate a specific Coast Guard documented vessel from the Coast Guard's Internet web site61 by entering the vessel's name or ID number. In addition to its net tonnage, information such as the owner's name, the vessel's age, length, horsepower, etc. is also available. To qualify for the exemption, a vessel must be exclusively engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers or at least primarily so engaged. This constitutional provision does not allow a proration of the exemption. Therefore, if a vessel qualifies, the exemption is allowed in its entirety. This applies even if the vessel is used 80% of the time in the exempt activity and 20% of the time in other activities, such as towing operations;62 incidental use for other purposes does not affect qualification for the exemption.63  60 61  51 Cal.App.2d 47 (1942). www.st.nmfs.gov/commercial/index.html. 62 Star and Crescent Boat Company v. County of San Diego (1958) 163 Cal.App. 2d 534. 63 This differs from exempt activities outlined under section 227, where a vessel must be engaged exclusively in such activities. AH 576 41 February 2002   Chapter 6  FREIGHT For the purposes of article XIII, section 3(l) of the California Constitution, ""freight"" generally denotes property transported by a carrier from a consignor to a consignee. Such a relationship requires that the transportation of freight or passengers must be ""for hire.""64 A commercial fishing vessel transporting its catch to its home port is not considered freight; however, such a vessel may qualify for the 4 percent preferential assessment (see Chapter 4 on documented vessels). Thus, one's own catch is not freight, but hauling another's catch for a fee is considered freight. Freight has a narrower meaning than just ""any property,"" so that presumably not just any object carried on the deck of a vessel amounts to ""freight"" to justify the tax exemption. When a parent company's subsidiaries utilize vessels for transportation of their own freight, such vessels generally do not qualify for exemption. The freight must be for hire by a separate entity (from a consignor to a consignee who are independent and separate from each other). A vessel more than 50 tons burden under contract to transport offshore work crews, supplies, equipment, and products to and from given points (such as shore to offshore drilling rigs) may also qualify for exemption under this article. Although the vessel is not available to haul other passengers or freight on a public carrier basis, its purpose remains under contract and is commercially engaged in hauling passengers and freight, which are not part of their own company. Tugboats of more than 50 tons burden primarily engaged in towing barges that carry freight are exempt under this article.65 Tugboats are an integral part of the transportation mechanism; barges are unable to move unless they receive a tow from a tugboat, and it is immaterial that they furnish part or all of the motive power. On the other hand, harbor tugs (of more than 50 tons burden) primarily engaged in assisting cargo or passenger vessels in navigating the waters and channels of the harbor are not exempt. ""Freight"" is not to be construed to be synonymous with ""property""; thus, the exemption does not apply to a tugboat that transports property by assisting ships, which carry freight or passengers, in docking and in harbor navigation activities, as the tugboat itself does not carry any freight or passengers. The relationship of such a tugboat to freight or passengers stems only from its assistance to a vessel engaged in the actual transporting of property or persons.66 Additionally, barges with cranes used to move freight from exempt vessels do not qualify for exemption. Such barges do not constitute the ""transportation of freight.""67  INOPERATIVE VESSELS OVER 50 TONS NET BURDEN Inoperative vessels over 50 tons net burden that have never been engaged in carrying freight or passengers do not qualify for the exemption, even if the owners intend to operate the vessel as such in the future.68 If such a vessel is moored here and not registered in any port in this state 64 65 66 67 68  Dragich v. County of Los Angeles (1939) 30 Cal.App.2d 397. Star and Crescent Boat Company, supra. Crowley Launch & Tugboat Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 437. Smith-Rice Heavy Lifts, Inc. v. Los Angeles County (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 190. Ships and Power Equipment Corp. v. County of San Diego (1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 522. 42 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 6  or elsewhere, the vessel is treated as ordinary personal property, taxable at the jurisdiction it is located. The special situs rules that have been developed with respect to the taxation of vessels engaged in foreign or interstate commerce do not apply to such vessels. This contrasts with vessels that were previously engaged in carrying freight or passengers but have temporarily withdrawn from such activities for various reasons. In those instances, the vessels may still qualify for the exemption, provided they have not been primarily used for other activities during the withdrawal period.  VESSELS UNDER CONSTRUCTION Vessels of more than 50 tons burden or 100 tons displacement are exempt from property taxation while under construction within California. The materials and parts that are held by the builder of the vessel at the site of construction for the specific purpose of incorporating them into the vessel are also exempt from property taxation.69  4 PER  CENT  AS  SESSMENT FOR  QUAL  IFYING  DOCUM  ENTED  VESSELS  Vessels that may qualify for a 4 percent preferential assessment, a form of exemption, are discussed in Chapter 4. Such vessels must be documented with the Coast Guard and employed or engaged exclusively in the activities detailed in section 227 to qualify for this preferential treatment.  HOME  OWNERS  ' EXEMPTION  An owner may apply the $7,000 homeowners' exemption to personal property, as authorized by section 218, if a vessel is the owner's place of abode. If a vessel also qualifies for the documented vessel exemption contained in section 227, the vessel owner must elect and properly claim only one of the exemptions. The nature of many fishing boats is such that they are commonly equipped with living quarters so the vessels may make extended cruises in search of their catch. A crew will live on the vessel while on the high seas, and there is nothing in the exemption statutes to imply that the owner or crew must leave the vessel while in port. The vessel, however, must be used as a full-time commercial fishing vessel to qualify for the documented vessel exemption. If the use of the vessel as a residence interferes with the fishing activities, or if the vessel is primarily a residence and commercial fishing is only incidental, then the vessel is not ""engaged or employed exclusively"" for any of the specified activities. Thus, a vessel owner must elect and properly claim only one of these exemptions.  69  Section 209.5. 43 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 6  DISAB  LED  VE  TERANS  ' EXEMPTION  Section 205.5 provides that the first $100,000 or $150,000 of a vessel's full value may be exempted from property taxation if the vessel is owned by a blind or disabled veteran, or the veteran's unmarried surviving spouse, with the exempt amount depending on the annual income of the veteran. To be eligible for the exemption, the veteran, or the veteran's unmarried surviving spouse, must occupy the vessel as his or her principal place of residence.  S  OLDIERS' AND SAILORS  ' CIV  IL  RELIEF ACT  OF  1940  The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 App. U.S.C.A. 574, provides that a person on active duty in military service may declare the situs of his or her personal property to be his or her home state. This declaration renders the personal property immune from taxation in the state where the individual is stationed on active duty. This act does not provide for an exemption from personal property taxation. Instead, it establishes tax situs of the property and thus establishes an exception to the general rule that personal property has its tax situs at the place it is located. The taxing agency with jurisdiction as the military person's domicile may tax the property if the laws so provide. This rule of tax situs is applicable whether the military person's domicile is another county of California or elsewhere within the United States. If a military person on active duty in California who claims residency in another state has a vessel, the vessel is immune from property taxation in California. A military person who declares situs of his or her personal property to be located elsewhere must complete form BOE-261-D, Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act Declaration. The assessor should have a signed declaration on file for each military person who claims the exemption. The declaration may be filed at any time without penalty or interest. If the military person is a resident of another county in California, a copy of the signed declaration should be sent to the assessor of the county of legal residence for appropriate assessment processing. If the military person claims residency in another state, a copy of the signed declaration should be sent to the county clerk or county assessor of the other state.

Use Chapter 4 for documentation criteria and Chapter 5 for the determination of situs. Exemptions on vessels are discussed in Chapter 6 of this handbook section. The following chart categorizes various types of vessels as to their typical assessability and qualification for exemption or special assessment. Additionally, any vessel may qualify for the business inventory exemption if it is held for sale or lease in the normal course of business.

AH 576  45  February 2002   Chapter 7  AMPHI  BIOUS  CRAFT  1. Amphibious craft is a device that may be propelled, moved, or drawn both upon water and upon land. 2. This type of craft is subjected to ad valorem taxation unless it is licensed to operate on the public highway under the provisions of section 10751 and following of the Revenue and Taxation Code or unless it has been reported as an off-highway vehicle subject to identification under section 38010 of the Vehicle Code. See also cabin cruiser and houseboat, if applicable.  BAR  GE  (LIGHT  ER  ,S  COW)  1. A barge means any non-self-propelled vessel (California Administrative Code, Title 14, Division 4, section 6552). A work barge, often called a scow, is usually a large flatbottomed vessel with broad, square ends. It may contain equipment on its decks. It may be used as a lighter to assist in unloading or loading vessels not lying at wharves, or in transporting freight about a harbor. 2. Barges may be documented for use in the coastwise trade if built in the United States, or if purchased from the Maritime Administration or War Shipping Administration by a citizen or under certain other conditions as listed in subpart 67.01-5 of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 3. Barges may be exempt from documentation because of their use in certain internal or inland waters of the state. These barges may not carry passengers and may not engage in trade with a contiguous foreign territory. Barges of less than five (net) tons are not documented. All barges not otherwise exempt must be documented when engaged in trade between ports in the United States or when engaged in the fisheries. 4. A barge may qualify for assessment at 4 percent of full cash value under the provisions of section 227 (see Chapter 4 and Form BOE-576-E in Appendix A). 5. Work barges, regardless of tonnage, that are not used for carrying freight or passengers are taxable. Barges of 50 net tons (burden) and larger carrying freight or passengers for hire are exempt from property taxation under article XIII, section 3(l) of the California Constitution.  AH 576  46  February 2002   Chapter 7  BULK C  ARRIERS  70  A bulk carrier is a ship with one or more large holds in which cargo in bulk is carried. Ordinarily, a ""bulker"" or ""bulk carrier"" will carry a certain type or types of cargo for most of its life. There are special designs for various cargoes. Bulk cargo ships that are ""geared"" may have very specialized equipment with which to off-load their cargo. A ship designed to carry cement in bulk may have a very highly specialized bore type device that allows the cargo to be conveyed from the cargo hold to a shore side loading system, where cement trucks are loaded directly from the ship. Also, many ports maintain facilities that, by the use of conveyors and cranes, directly load scrap steel, wheat, grain, or any bulk commodity directly into the ship. Most bulk carriers are over 50 (net) tons burden and carry freight, and are therefore exempt from property taxation under section 3(l), article XIII of the California Constitution.  CARGO SHIPS71 Cargo ships are generally one of the following types: 1. Bulk cargo such as coal, wheat, cement, grain, or any item moved in bulk quantities. 2. Break bulk cargo is cargo that may be affixed to a pallet. Palletized cargo is organized in such a way as to facilitate the loading into the ship by crane or derrick. The ship may carry some bulk cargo, some break bulk, and some containers. Smaller, inter-island ships generally carry a variety of cargo sizes, types, and containers. 3. Containerized cargo is cargo enclosed into a standardized shipping container. 4. Liquid cargo such as oil, molasses, and chemicals are carried in bulk in large tank ships. 5. Roll on / Roll Off specialized ships. Cargo ships are described by the manner in which they manage their cargoes. Cargo ships originally had cranes or derricks built onto the ship to facilitate the on loading and off loading of cargo. Today many ships were re-built without any ability to load or unload cargo and depend upon the port facility at which they dock. Such a ship is referred to as a ""gearless"" ship, whereas a ship with the capacity to handle its own cargo is referred to as a ""geared"" ship.  CONTAINER SHIPS72 The ""containerized"" cargo industry. An the entire truck trailer the truck trailer at the 70 71 72  cargo unit was introduced in the mid-1950s and revolutionized the enterprising trucking company owner seized upon the idea of loading unit (minus the wheels) onto a ship to be off-loaded and placed back on port of destination. A vast portion of all cargo is transported in container  www.shipinformationcenter.com. Ibid. Ibid. 47 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 7  ships. These are ships designed with special deck hardware and cranes to load containers directly into the holds of the ship and to stack them on deck. Massive container ship companies operate around the world -- Sea-Land, Ever Green, and NKY to name just a few. Most ports around the world maintain container cranes at the dockside. The container ship berths are adjacent to the crane area, have specialized equipment, handle the containers, and load and unload the ship. Containers come in two basic sizes. A 20-foot container, referred to as a TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit), is the basic measurement of a container ship. However, basic containers also come in a 40-foot size, or FEU for Forty-foot Equivalent Unit. When referring to the size of a container ship, it will be described as ""geared"" or ""gearless"" and the number of TEU's that it can carry. Consequently a ""gearless, 500 TEU"" containership tells you everything you need to know about the size of the ship. Some modern container ships will carry upwards of 4,000 TEU's. Usually a container port is equipped with several container cranes, each of which costs millions of dollars, and will simultaneously unload a large container ship.  CAB  IN  C  RUISER  1. A cabin cruiser is a powerboat equipped with a cabin, which usually contains plumbing and all arrangements for living aboard the vessel. 2. With few exceptions, a cabin cruiser must either display a ""CF"" number or be documented by the Coast Guard. The five-ton minimum limitation for documentation usually applies to a cabin cruiser that is in excess of 25 feet in length. 3. A cabin cruiser may be entitled to the 4 percent assessment under the provisions of section 227. A cabin cruiser of more than 50 tons burden is not exempt from taxation under article XIII, section 3(1) of the State Constitution unless it is engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers. See ""fishing vessels"" and ""tugboats"" for vessels similar in type to cabin cruisers.  CAN  OE  1. A canoe is a form of small boat, long and narrow and sharp at both ends, usually propelled by paddle, with no rudder or sail. 2. A canoe is exempt from numbering (i.e., a ""CF"" number under the provisions of section 9873 of the Vehicle Code), unless it is of the type powered with a motor. A canoe may be exempt from taxation pursuant to section 228, by having a value of $400 or less.  AH 576  48  February 2002   Chapter 7  CAT  AMARAN  A catamaran is a twin-hulled boat, with hulls side by side.  DRE  DGE  1. A dredge is a vessel with the capability of dredging; it may be self-propelled. 2. A dredge is not exempt from taxation under the provisions of article XIII, section 3(l) of the State Constitution when over 50 tons burden, as it does not carry passengers or freight. See the comments under ""barges"" above.  FERRY 1. A ferry includes a vessel having provisions only for deck passengers and/or vehicles, operating on a short run on a frequent schedule between two points over the most direct water route, and offering a public service of a type normally attributed to a bridge or tunnel. A ferry does not include a vessel navigating the water of the ocean. (California Administrative Code, Title 14, Division 4, section 6552.) 2. A ferry not owned by a governmental agency is subject to taxation unless it is more than 50 tons burden and exempt under article XIII, section 3(l) of the State Constitution. Under the provisions of section 1137, where a ferry connects points in more than one county, the ferryboat shall be assessed in equal proportion in the counties it connects.  FISHING VESS  EL  1. Any type of vessel may be used for fishing, such as trawlers, fishing tugs, cabin cruisers, etc. 2. Fishing vessels may be eligible for the 4 percent assessment under the provisions of section 227. Refer to the qualifying criteria discussed in Chapter 4, Documented Vessels.  FLOATING DRY DOCK Floating dry docks are used for the repair of below-the-waterline fittings and suffixes of ships. The dry docks are usually moored in dredged berths by anchors and vertical pilings. They are connected to electrical, water, and sewage disposal lines ashore. As such, they should be classified as improvements. There may be instances where floating dry docks are designed to operate and do operate as self-contained units independently of all utility and other lines ashore. In such instances the dry docks may qualify as personal property. AH 576 49 February 2002   Chapter 7  There will be an assessment of a possessory interest if a mooring area is publicly owned and if the floating dry dock is classified as an improvement. Some publicly owned floating dry docks are leased to private parties. A possessory interest assessment would then apply to the dry dock and the mooring area if both are publicly owned.  FLOATING HOME  73  A floating home is assessed in the same manner as real property. For property tax purposes, floating homes are not categorized as vessels. ""Floating home"" means a floating structure that is all of the following: 1. It is designed and built to be used, or is modified to be used, as a stationary waterborne residential dwelling. 2. It has no mode of power of its own. 3. It is dependent for utilities upon a continuous utility linkage to a source originating on shore. 4. It has a permanent continuous hookup to a shoreside sewage system.  HOUS  EBOAT  1. A houseboat is a covered boat, sometimes used as a dwelling. 2. It is usually a large, flat-bottomed boat with a superstructure much like a house. 3. A houseboat is subject to taxation except when it is an amphibious type vessel licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles as a motor vehicle. See the comments for ""amphibious craft"" and ""cabin cruiser,"" if applicable.  KAY  AK  A kayak is a vessel similar to a canoe; it is completely decked, the covering being laced about the paddler. See the comments under ""canoe.""  LIFE  BOAT  1. A lifeboat is a boat carried by a vessel for use in an emergency. A ship's lifeboat is a lifeboat used solely for lifesaving purposes and does not include dinghies, tenders, speedboats, or other types of craft carried aboard a vessel and used for other than lifesaving purposes. (California Administrative Code, Title 14, division 4, section 6552.) 73  Section 229. 50 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 7  2. A ship's lifeboat may not be documented nor is it not required to be numbered (i.e., a ""CF"" number). 3. The value of the lifeboat should be included in the total value of the vessel. A lifeboat would be exempt from taxation if the vessel carrying it is exempt and it would be eligible for the 4 percent assessment if the vessel carrying it is so eligible.  LIFE  RAFT  1. A life raft is a buoyant raft used in life saving. Rafts come in various sizes, such as 1-man, 2-man, 4-man, 6-man, and larger. 2. A life raft may not be documented. A life raft propelled by oars or paddles is not required to be numbered (i.e., a ""CF"" number) under section 9873, subdivision (e) of the Vehicle Code. 3. A life raft is subject to taxation if the larger vessel carrying included in the value of the larger vessel. The exemption (vessels with a value of $400 or less) may apply to a life raft recreational equipment, and not used as a ""life raft"" for a larger the raft is and should be provided in section 228 when used exclusively as vessel.  LIV  ERY  BOAT  A livery boat is any vessel that is held for renting, leasing, or chartering. A livery boat may qualify for the business inventory exemption.74  OCE  ANOGRAPHIC  RES  EARCH  VESS  EL  An oceanographic research vessel is a vessel that the secretary of the department in which the United States Coast Guard is operating, or its successor, finds is an oceanographic research vessel under the laws of the United States. 1. Oceanography is defined as the study of the environment in the oceans and its phenomena. Any type of vessel could be used in this type of research; however, Title 46, section 3.05-3 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides that the term ""oceanographic research vessel"" is a vessel which the U.S. Coast Guard finds is employed exclusively in one or more of the following: (a) oceanographic instruction; (b) limnologic instruction; (c) oceanographic research; or, (d) limnologic research."" Limnology is defined as the science that deals with the physical, chemical, and biological properties and features of fresh waters. 2. A vessel so used is subject to taxation, but it may qualify for the 4 percent assessment.  74  Sections 129 and 219; Property Tax Rule 133 and Chapter 6 of this handbook section. 51 February 2002  AH 576   Chapter 7  Form BOE-576-E must be completed and filed with the assessor by February 15 in order to qualify for the 4 percent assessment provision. Specific facts and documents must be presented to the assessor in support of the claim that the vessel is used exclusively for oceanographic research.75  PERS  ONAL  WA  TERCRAFT  1. A personal watercraft is a form of a small craft powered by an engine and jet-water pump. These vessels are usually between 7.5 and 13 feet in length and carry no more than two passengers. They are designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel, rather than in the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside of a vessel. These vessels are frequently referred to as Jet-Skis. 2. These vessels must be numbered (i.e., a CF number). 3. These vessels are subject to taxation but may be exempt pursuant to section 228, by having a value of $400 or less.  RAC  ING  BOAT  1. Any type of vessel may be used in racing; however, motorboats and sailboats are the usual types. 2. These vessels must be documented or numbered, (i.e., a ""CF"" number); see Chapter 4 of this handbook section.  REFRI  GERATOR SHIP  76  A refrigerator ship is equipped with compressor and generators designed to keep cargo cold at a specific temperature for the time of the voyage.

AH 576  70  February 2002   Appendix B  PROPERTY TAX RULES RULE 133. BUSINESS INVENTORY EXEMPTION. (a) SCOPE OF EXEMPTION. (1) ""Business inventories"" that are eligible for exemption from taxation under Section 129 of the Revenue and Taxation Code include all tangible personal property, whether raw materials, work in process or finished goods, which will become a part of or are themselves items of personalty held for sale or lease in the ordinary course of business.... (2) The phrase ""ordinary course of business"" does not constitute a limitation on the type of property which may be held for sale or lease, but it does require that the property be intended for sale or lease in accordance with the regular and usual practice and method of the business of the vendor or lessor. (3) The phrase ""goods intended for sale or lease"" means property acquired, manufactured, produced, processed, raised or grown which is already the subject of a contract of sale or which is held and openly offered for sale or lease or will be so held and offered for sale or lease at the time it becomes a marketable product. Property that is ready for sale or lease must be displayed, advertised or otherwise brought to the attention of the potential purchasers or lessees by means normally employed by vendors or lessors of the product. (b) EXCLUSIONS. include: Property eligible for the ""business inventories"" exemption does not  (1) Property of any description in the hands of a vendee, lessee or other recipient on the lien date which has been purchased, leased, rented, or borrowed primarily for use by the vendee, lessee or other recipient of the property rather than for sale or lease or for physical incorporation into a product which is to be sold or leased. Examples of property excluded from business inventories are office supplies, furniture, machines and equipment and manufacturing machinery, equipment and supplies such as dies, patterns, jigs, tooling or chemicals used to produce a chemical or physical reaction, and contractors' supplies, tools, concrete forms, and other items that will not be incorporated into and become a part of the property. Also ineligible are materials that a contractor is holding to incorporate into real property that will be retained for his own use. (2) Property being used by its owner for any purpose not directly associated with the prospective sale or lease of that property. (3) Property actually leased or rented on the lien date. (4) Property that has been used by the holder prior to the lien date, even though held for lease on the lien date.  AH 576  71  February 2002   Appendix B  (5) Property intended to be used by the lessor after being leased or during intervals between leases even though held for lease on the lien date. (6) Property in the hands of a lessor who, with intent to enjoy the benefits of the inventory exemption, had leased the property for a period that expired shortly before the lien date but who renewed, extended or renegotiated the lease shortly thereafter.  RULE 151. VESSELS SUBJECT TO THE FOUR PERCENT ASSESSMENT. (a) A vessel which meets the requirements of section 130 of the Revenue and Taxation Code shall be assessed at four percent of full cash value under the provisions of section 227 of said code if it is engaged or employed exclusively in one or more of the following activities: (1) The taking and possession of fish or other living resource of the sea for commercial purposes. (2) Instruction or research studies as an oceanographic research vessel. (3) Carrying or transporting seven or more people for hire for commercial passenger fishing purposes and holds a current certificate of inspection issued by the United States Coast Guard. A vessel shall not be deemed to be engaged or employed in activities other than the carrying or transporting of seven or more persons for hire for commercial passenger fishing purposes by reason of that vessel being used occasionally for dive, tour, or whale watching purposes. For purposes of this subdivision, ""occasionally"" means 15 percent or less of the total operating time logged for the immediately preceding assessment year. (b) In determining whether a vessel is engaged or employed exclusively for ""commercial purposes"" in paragraph (a)(1) above or ""commercial passenger fishing purposes"" in paragraph (a)(3) the assessor shall consider the design of the vessel and the business engaged in by, or occupation of, the owner and any other person leasing or chartering the vessel. In considering the design of the vessel, the assessor shall determine whether the vessel has adequate carrying capacity, gear, and mechanical equipment sufficient to enable the owner to accomplish his intended commercial purpose. Any pleasure-boat use of the vessel is disqualifying irrespective of whether the vessel is or is not licensed as a commercial vessel. (c) Prior to approving the claim of a vessel purporting to be engaged or employed exclusively as an oceanographic research vessel in paragraph (a)(2) the assessor shall require supporting documentation. Such documentation shall include one or more of the following: (1) A statement of the course of study with a recognized college or university. (2) The contract pursuant to which the vessel engages in research for a governmental agency, private foundation, or other organization.  AH 576  72  February 2002   Appendix B  (3) A statement of the study being made, the procedure being used, and the estimated completion date. (d) Vessels that may qualify under this rule include those registered with or licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles as well as those required to have and having a valid marine document issued by the Department of Transportation, Vessel Documentation Branch, U.S. Coast Guard or any federal agency subsequently granted licensing authority. This rule does not apply to vessels exempt from taxation under article XIII, sec. 3(1) of the Constitution of the State of California. (e) Tangible personal property subject to the four percent assessment shall include the vessel and all equipment and furnishings that are normally required aboard the vessel during the accomplishment of the functions for which the vessel is being utilized.  VEHICLE CODE DIVISION 3.5, REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER OF VESSELS Relevant sections of the Vehicle Code are included below. Section 9840. Definitions.

(h) ""Use"" means operate, navigate, or employ. Section 9850. Numbering of Undocumented Vessels Every undocumented vessel using the waters or on the waters of this state shall be currently numbered. No person shall operate nor shall any county, city, or political subdivision give permission for the operation of any undocumented vessel on those waters unless the undocumented vessel is numbered in accordance with this chapter, or in accordance with applicable federal law, or in accordance with a federally approved numbering system of another state, and unless: (1) the certificate of number issued to such undocumented vessel is in full force and effect, and (2) the identifying number set forth in the certificate of number is displayed on each side of the bow of the undocumented vessel for which the identifying number was issued. Section 9854. Federal or Out-of-State Registration The owner of any vessel already covered by a number in full force and effect which has been issued to it pursuant to then operative federal law or a federally approved numbering system of another state shall make application within 30 days after the 90-day reciprocity period provided for in Section 9873. Such application shall be in a manner and pursuant to the procedure required for the issuance of a number under Section 9853. Section 9869. Information to Be Transmitted to County Assessor The department shall transmit information from each initial application and each transfer application or renewal application to the county assessor in the county of residence of the owner of the vessel and to the county assessor in the county in which the vessel is principally kept if other than the county of residence of the owner, if such other county is known to the department. If an application shows that the owner of the vessel has changed his residence from AH 576 74 February 2002   Appendix B  one county to another county or shows that there has been a change in the county in which the vessel is principally kept, the department shall transmit information of the change to the assessor of the county in which the owner of the vessel formerly resided or to the assessor of the county in which the vessel formerly was principally kept. After the department receives a notice pursuant to Section 9864, the department shall transmit information of the destruction or abandonment to the assessor of the county in which the owner of the vessel resides and to the assessor of the county in which the vessel is or was principally kept, if other than the county of residence of the owner, if such other county was known to the department. Section 9873.

(b) A vessel from a country other than the United States temporarily using the waters of this state. (c) A public vessel of the United States, another state or subdivision thereof or municipality of such other state. (d) A ship's lifeboat. (e) Any vessel belonging to a class of boats which has been exempted from numbering by the department after the department has found that the numbering of vessels of such class will not materially aid in their identification; and, if any agency of the federal government has a numbering system applicable to the class of vessels to which the vessel in question belongs, after the department has further found that the vessel would also be exempt from numbering if it were subject to the federal law. An undocumented vessel propelled solely by oars or paddles and an undocumented vessel eight feet or less propelled solely by sail are exempt from the provisions of this chapter.  AH 576  75  February 2002   Appendix C  APPENDIX C: SUMMARY OF COURT CASES California Shipping Company v. City and County of San Francisco (1907) 150 Cal. 145. Vessels employed in foreign or interstate commerce which have not by the manner of their use acquired an actual situs elsewhere are properly assessed for taxation at the port of domicile of the sole owner where they are registered under the laws of the United States, regardless of the fact that they were outside the waters of that state from a date preceding the lien date and may have never been within the waters of that state. Continental Dredging Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1973) 366 F.Supp. 1133. If a sea-going vessel is inactive and not engaged in any kind of commerce for a period of time that cannot be considered temporary, the vessel acquires a taxable situs where it is anchored or moored, irrespective of any so-called home port. Thus, a Liberian vessel in a California port for nine years from the date of lay-up with an apparent refusal to engage in foreign commerce was held to have lost its status as engaging in foreign commerce and became subject to the imposition of county property taxes. County of San Diego v. Lafayette Steel Company (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 690. The taxable situs of a vessel is not determined by the owner's designation of a home port but depends on the existence of sufficient contacts, such as the use and employment of the vessel within the jurisdiction and the opportunities, benefits, or protection afforded the vessel by the jurisdiction, between the situs and the vessel, to satisfy due process. Thus, a vessel registered in Alaska but moored in a California port for an entire year, except for a one-month voyage, and sold through escrow in California the next year became subject to property taxation in the county. Crowley Launch & Tugboat Co. v. County of Los Angeles (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 437. ""Freight"" is not construed to be synonymous with ""property""; thus, article XIII, section 3(l) of the California Constitution does not apply to a harbor tugboat that transports property in the form of vessels propelled by the tugboat in docking and in harbor navigation activities, where the tugboat itself does not carry any freight. De Luz Homes Inc. v. County of San Diego (1955) 45 Cal.2d 546. The absence of an actual market for a particular type of property does not mean that it has no value or that it may escape from the mandate of the California Constitution, article XIII, section 1, that all property shall be taxed in proportion to its value, but only that the assessor must then use such pertinent factors as replacement costs and analyses for determining valuation. In valuing a leasehold interest in exempt lands and improvements by the capitalization of income method it is improper, in computing the anticipated net income to be capitalized, to deduct from anticipated gross income the lessee's charges for rent, amortization of his investment, or payments of principal and interest on his mortgage debt. The proper method of valuing a possessory interest in a housing project at a permanent military installation is to deduct from annual anticipated gross income the operating and maintenance expenses and the amount required by the leased to be deposited to a replacement reserve, and to capitalize the difference for the remaining years of the lease at a rate which will allow for risk, interest, and taxes.  AH 576  76  February 2002   Appendix C  Dragich v. County of Los Angeles (1939) 30 Cal.App.2d 397. The exemption for vessels of more than 50 tons net burden was not intended to exempt all vessels of the specified tonnage, but only those engaged in the transportation of property or persons for hire, and fishing boats of the type known as ""purse seiners,"" which are engaged in fishing and no other business and are not used for the transportation of property or persons for hire, are not exempted from taxation by this constitutional provision. The word ""freight"" has more than one meaning but it generally denotes property transported by a carrier from a consignor to a consignee. In one accepted sense, it means ""the hire or compensation paid by anyone for the transport of goods,"" and when used to denote the property transported, it carries the definite implication that the transportation is for hire. Favalora v. County of Humboldt (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 969. A vessel not yet completed as of the lien date, and thus neither documented nor engaged in commercial fishing, is not eligible for the 4 percent preferential assessment. A vessel may not be documented until it is completed; it cannot be said to be engaged in commercial fishing while it is being built. Haman v. County of Humboldt (1973) 8 Cal.3d 922. To qualify for the preferential assessment specified in section 227, a vessel is not required to be documented within California. Such a requirement would be invalid as an unjustified discrimination between residents owning fishing vessels documented in California and residents owning vessels documented in other states Hays v. Pacific Mail S.S. Co. (1855) 17 How (58 U.S.) 596. Vessels plying the high seas are generally bound by the ""home port"" doctrine that permits only the taxing authority of a home port to impose a tax. No other jurisdiction, including those ports visited by the vessel, has the power to tax it. California could not tax an oceangoing vessel owned and registered in New York and operated between that port and San Francisco. Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles (1979) 441 U.S. 434. The assessment of property tax on cargo containers owned by a Japanese shipping company, whose vessels and containers had a home port in Japan and were subject to property tax there, was in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as the tax resulted in the multiple taxation of instrumentalities used in foreign commerce. Kiessig v. County of San Diego (1942) 51 Cal.App.2d 47. Under article XIII, section 3(l) of the California Constitution, vessels of ""more than fifty (50) tons burden"" shall mean ""50 tons net burden."" The quoted words are of a technical nature and connote a measurement peculiar to ships and shipping. Martinac v. County of San Diego (1967) 255 Cal.App 2d 175. A documented vessel, primarily located at sea, but in California waters on the lien date or entering specific California ports through the course of the year transiently to take in and discharge cargo, refuel, pick up crew members, perform minor repairs, etc. is not taxable in California when the vessel's home port designation is in another state and personal property tax is collected by that state. A California port is only a ""port of convenience.""  AH 576  77  February 2002   Appendix C  Olson v. San Francisco (1905) 148 Cal. 80. A vessel may, by being indefinitely and exclusively employed within the waters of another state, acquire actual situs in that state. By actual use, the vessel has acquired a permanent actual situs in the other state and is no longer engaged in any activity except within the limits of that state. Sayles v. County of Los Angeles (1943) 59 Cal.2d 295. Vessels which are temporarily situated in California on the lien date, but which have permanent taxable situs outside of the state, are not assessable in California. Thus, a tugboat owned by persons residing in Alaska and registered at a port there had a situs there even though the tugboat was leased to a California firm for a definite period of time for use along the shores of California. The owner still retained control of the vessel and the vessel returned to the home port upon the termination of the lease. Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. County of Alameda (1974) 12 Cal.3d 772. Cargo containers used exclusively in interstate and foreign commerce are subject to tax on an apportioned basis by the various states, as mandated by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, which have sufficient contacts with the taxpayer. The home port doctrine does not act to shield a taxpayer from taxation by a nondomiciliary jurisdiction when a taxpayer has sufficient contacts with that jurisdiction, even if the taxpayer is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce via international waters. Ships and Power Equipment Corp. v. County of San Diego (1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 522. Inoperative vessels over 50 tons net burden that have never been engaged in carrying freight or passengers do not qualify for the exemption, even if the owners intend to operate the vessel as such in the future. If a vessel is moored in California but not registered in any port of this state or elsewhere, the vessel is treated as ordinary personal property and taxable at the jurisdiction it is located. Thus, a decommissioned, undocumented, and inoperative naval landing craft owned by a foreign corporation, none of whose owners reside in this state, intended for use and moored in a harbor in this state acquired a tax situs here. Smith-Rice Heavy Lifts, Inc. v. Los Angeles County (1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 190. Barges that act as stationary, though floating, piers for the cranes located on them and the movement of various items of property for hire by means of the cranes do not constitute the ""transportation of freight"" within the meaning of the constitutional exemption when such ""transportation"" occurs in connection with dredging, laying pipe, or construction work. When derricks or cranes are operating upon their stationary barges, they are not engaged as ""a carrier"" transporting ""freight."" Although personal property lifted and deposited by cranes during their ""cargo (non-carry)"" operations may properly be characterized as ""freight,"" such characterization stems from their past or future relationship to the vessel being serviced rather than their relationship to the barges. Star and Crescent Boat Company v. County of San Diego (1958) 163 Cal.App. 2d 534. Tugboats of more than 50 tons burden engaged in towing barges loaded with freight from point to point, work in which the tugs spent more than 80 percent of their time, were engaged in the transportation of freight within the meaning of article XIII, section 3(l) of the  AH 576  78  February 2002   Appendix C  California Constitution and were thus exempt from property taxation. Such vessels are primarily engaged in the exempt business and are allowed the exemption in its entirety; there is no proration of the exemption based on the percentage of time spent on the exempt activity and the time spent on the non-exempt activity. A tugboat employed as the means of locomotion of barges that carry freight is engaged in the transportation of freight. Star-Kist Foods, Inc. v. H. L. Byram (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 313. Unless an ocean-going vessel has established actual situs elsewhere, the domicile of the vessel's owner is the situs of the vessel. Xerox Corporation v. County of Orange (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 746. Under the market value concept, where price is the basis of value, the sales tax and freight charges are elements of value.

Reggie Jackson once said, ""Fans don't boo nobodies."" If they weren't losing market share, our competitors wouldn't care. And with one of every four new transit buses purchased now fueled by natural gas, that's what I call market share. Alternative fuels are finding homes in high fuel-use fleets, but it hasn't been easy. The challenges you know well--shrinking budgets, spotty support from Congress, and in some segments of the AFV market, diminishing vehicle choices. Recently we examined nationwide AFV population data from DOE's Energy Information Administration from 1992 to 2000, as well as more recent reports and projections from Clean Cities coordinators. Our objective was to re-examine the program's ""million-billion"" goals--to put 1 million AFVs on U.S. roads, displacing 1 billion gallons of petroleum fuel annually, by 2010. The initial rationale for those goals, you may recall, was that if AFV growth within Clean Cities continues at 17 percent per year while growth elsewhere stays at its historical rate of 7 percent, we would succeed.

Within a narrow margin of error, we've found that the required growth rates have been achieved in recent years. One particularly bright spot is the growth in medium- and heavy-duty trucks. That segment of the market increased by 40 percent in 2001 and 35 percent in 2002. Because they use more fuel, those vehicles may accelerate the development of alternative fuel infrastructure. They can also be instrumental in providing critical services that might be disrupted by petroleum shortages. Oncoming technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells could make contributions previously unanticipated. Interestingly, the prospects for hydrogen-fueled transportation have been cited as a cause for concern about the future of existing alternative fuels. But hydrogen development could actually stimulate the market for today's fuels. See ""Clean Cities and the Hydrogen Future"" by DOE Assistant Secretary David Garman, page 8. In the meantime, we will continue to consider whether our targets make sense. At this point, our answer is a cautious yes. So let's keep moving toward our goals, nibbling away at the gasoline and diesel markets. And let's try to relish the booing as much as we appreciate any applause.

In establishing an AFV fueling station, the secrets to success are more varied, relating to facility design, planning, marketing, accounting, and staffing. Best practices are the core business of consultants such as Energy International and Marathon Technical Services. Such firms concentrate on the technical aspects of station management. Equally important are lessons learned by companies such as southern California-based Clean Energy (formerly ENRG), which has grown to be the nation's largest operator of CNG stations; and Clean Fueling Technologies, which makes fuel-dispensing equipment for LPG and E85 stations. Valuable case history comes also from trade associations and individual entrepreneurs. Following is some of their best advice:  Find the big fish... The first task is to identify customers who will use the station. How many vehicles will use it, and what type? Are there alternative fuel fleets in the area? ""In the past some people believed `if we build it they will come,' but many speculative CNG stations have failed,"" says Rob Adams, vice president of Marathon, which specializes in CNG station design. ""If you don't know who's going to use the station, you shouldn't build it."" There should be a base number of quantifiable customers, such as a local fleet of alternative fuel taxis, to get the station started, says Adams. Clean Energy calls them anchor tenants. Many of its CNG stations are on private land owned by the largest customer. Some are divided by a gate, with public-access fuel dispensers on the outside and private fueling on the inside. Clean Energy operates stations of that kind for SunLine Transit and Waste Management, both in southern California. Nationwide, stations have been anchored by shuttle operators, taxi fleets, and rental car companies. Airports are among the most common locations for successful publicly accessible stations.  ...but don't forget individual consumers Relatively few E85 stations were designed that way from the ground up. At most, E85 was added long after the station was established in selling gasoline. Marketing of E85 may be ignored, with signage that mentions only gasoline and diesel fuel. Often E85 is dispensed from aboveground tanks placed far from the main driveway. ""Station operators should definitely have a sign"" advertising the presence and the price of E85 along with gasoline, says Tim Gerlach, coordinator of the Clean Cities coalition based in Minnesota's Twin Cities. This advice applies to any location where gasoline might overshadow the presence of an alternative fuel. Prominent signage is lacking at many CNG and LPG stations as well. E85 station operators walk a fine line, says Gerlach. They want to sell the product, but only to the right customers--those driving flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs), which can run on E85, gasoline, or any combination of the two. Drivers Nozzle ""talkers"" inform customers in Minnesota of gasoline-only cars are often curious about that E85 isn't for everyone. E85 because of its lower price. To discourage them while appealing to FFV drivers, some stations use nozzle ""talkers""--small signs installed directly on the pump dispensing handle, explaining that E85 is for FFVs only. PIX 02203  Catering to fleets is a time-tested way to help ensure fueling station success.  4   Match the station's size with today's demand... Stations should be sized based on present-day alternative fuel demand. Large-capacity CNG stations are costly (as much as $1 million for light-duty vehicle stations and several million dollars for transit stations), and an underused station does not operate as smoothly as a fully used one. ""In the past people building CNG stations said go big or go home,"" says Mario Pirraglia, vice president of marketing and international sales for FuelMaker. ""The reality is if you go big, you may go broke. Stations that were sized based on projected future demand were often underutilized, and many failed."" A station shouldn't be underequipped either. ""Don't skimp on storage,"" says Adams. ""Additional storage improves a station's performance and reliability."" Appropriate redundancy can also improve reliability. Several small compressors are better than a single large one, says Pirraglia. This ensures Sometimes one pump is plenty, particularly continued operation if one in the early stages of operating a station. compressor fails.  Ask questions In and around Atlanta, Georgia Power has installed approximately 50 publicly accessible facilities for charging electric vehicles (EVs). According to Don Francis, the company's EV infrastructure product manager, the question of where to put them has often led to another question: ""Where is somebody going where they'll want to stay for a while and be out of their car?"" The answer has often included shopping malls, transit stations, airports, and office buildings. Traditional gasoline stations typically don't double well as EV charging facilities, says Francis. But some BP stations, with the help of Georgia power, have experi- ""Plug in the Sun"" stations feed current mented with EV recharging. to EVs and to Atlanta's power grid. Several ""Plug in the Sun"" stations feature grid-connected solar power systems, and EV recharging for motorists who need only to ""top off"" for another 5 or 10 miles of range. Even that can take 30 minutes, so the stations are equipped with convenience stores, coffee and sandwich shops, and comfortable seating.  ...but leave room to grow While building for today, it is also important to plan for tomorrow. A station should be able to grow as the demand from fleets and public use grows. ""Think in terms of future growth when picking and siting equipment,"" says Adams. One way to do this is by using modular design. Proper planning and equipment selection enables modular compressors, dispensers, and storage to be added easily. FuelMaker used this concept when installing CNG stations for the New York Department of Transportation. In 1999, 30 CNG stations were established with single cascade fast-fill CNG units. To meet increasing demand, additional compressors were added to eight of the stations in 2002 and 2003. In Georgia, the Fulton County Public Works Department initially established two CNG fast-fill stations, each with two compressors. As demand grew, rather than adding more compressors per station, the county added a third station. The result was greater geographic reach as well as increased capacity overall.  Hand off the hassles A substantial federal tax incentive makes E85 cost competitive with gasoline. Whoever blends the fuel--whether it's a refinery, bulk plant, or fueling station--earns a tax credit of about 39 cents per gallon. But many small stations steer clear of E85, particularly if they have to do the blending themselves. Qualifying for the deduction can be complicated, requiring the proper corporate legal structure and more sophisticated accounting than many stations can afford. Another potential problem for small operators is that a full year 's accumulated tax credits don't yield any benefit until tax time. In the Twin Cities region of Minnesota, some larger suppliers have relieved small stations of the hassles. The Marathon Ashland Petroleum refinery (not related to Marathon Technical Services) is one example. It blends the fuel, claims the tax credit, and passes along savings to its customers. Its efforts are part of a company pilot program to help establish E85 in the Twin Cities region. ""If station operators don't want to get into blending E85 on site, I'd suggest they approach a supplier about doing it,"" says spokesperson Linda Casey. Such an arrangement with a fuel supplier also removes the physical and logistical hassles of fuel blending onsite. This can be helpful to biodiesel stations as well as E85 facilities.

Georgia Power/PIX 12501  5   Take all the cards Customer convenience is key, both in consumer business and fuel sales to fleets. That means accepting payment in as many forms as possible, including credit cards. Clean Fueling Technologies (CFT) makes dispensing equipment for LPG stations. Its pumps include universal card readers, linked by phone to a credit-checking service. ""The reality is, you need to take payment in whatever form the customer wants to give it to you,"" says CFT president Curtis Donaldson. That reality became clear in southern California, when new state rules required many taxi fleets to switch to CNG. It was good news for station operators such as recently renamed ""Clean Energy,"" but the bad news was that independent taxi drivers as a group represent a high credit risk. The company responded with universal card readers. The units honor cards Universal credit card readers make things issued by many CNG more convenient for customers, says Curtis suppliers such as Donaldson of Clean Fueling Technologies. FleetStar, SoCalGas, and Pacific Gas & Electric, as well as Clean Energy. They also accept Visa and Mastercard, and American Express will soon be added. Many new dispensers also include video screens, which are often used for advertising. In some areas, customers are required to have training in pump operation. The units first show a 60-second training video, then ""unlock"" the pump. A two-digit code is issued, enabling the viewer to bypass the training next time.  Take it off the shelf An alternative fuel station may be around for many years, but an equipment manufacturer may be gone tomorrow. If that happens, a station using proprietary equipment from one manufacturer suddenly finds itself without parts and service support. Even when the proprietary manufacturer stays in business, parts and service are often more readily available for nonproprietary ""off-the-shelf"" equipment. ""We stay away from proprietary hardware when possible,"" says Adams. ""You can't eliminate it, but you can minimize it."" For example, compressor controllers can be proprietary or Electronic components can be proprietary or off-the-shelf. off-the-shelf. Such devices monitor temperature and pressure within the compressor; they control the system by starting and stopping the compressor, opening and closing valves, etc. Several large companies manufacture programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that can serve this purpose. PLCs made by these third-party manufacturers are used in a wide variety of industries, so parts and service are widely available. ""If I'm in Cleveland and need a third-party PLC part, I can make a call and have a replacement in an hour, and there are probably a dozen companies that provide service,"" says Adams. ""If I need a proprietary compressor controller part and the single-source supplier doesn't have it, I've got a problem."" Valves can also be proprietary or off-the-shelf, whereas most components inside the CNG compressor are proprietary.  PIX 10937  Take it away When pressurized in a vehicle, propane (also called LPG or liquefied petroleum gas) is a gaseous fuel. But in its stored form at fueling stations, it is a liquid. It requires less pressurization than CNG, so propane fueling stations are often less costly and less complicated to build. Propane tanks can be placed aboveground, which brings another potential advantage. An entire functional fueling station--tanks, pumps, and all--can be installed on a movable ""skid."" In a matter of days, a station can be installed or removed and taken elsewhere. Preparing a site for installation typically takes $4,000$5,000 of preparation work. One Canadian company exploited the idea of movable skids in the 1980s, in building its own infrastructure. Superior Propane effectively tested locations by installing movable skids onsite. If a site showed promise commercially, the company would then install permanent pumps and tanks and take its movable equipment elsewhere.  On a movable skid, a fully functioning LPG or E85 station can easily be installed, removed, or relocated.  In the United States, the movable site concept is being tried by suppliers of E85, another liquid fuel that can be stored aboveground.  6  Clean Fueling Technologies/PIX 12500   Select the right sort of CNG station Selecting the right configuration is key to the station's success. According to Energy International, a global energy consulting firm, the main considerations in choosing a station type are the number and type of vehicles fueled and their fueling pattern. Secondary considerations include location, potential future growth, and permitting restrictions. Its CNG Station Guide is available online (see ""Natural Gas Resources"" below). Energy International outlines four major CNG station types: Time-fill stations fill vehicles over a six- to eight-hour period.  Cascade fast-fill stations provide fast and convenient fuel-  Compressors compress natural gas from pipeline pressure (5100 psi) to the required vehicle pressure (24003600 psi) and dispense it into multiple vehicles simultaneously. These stations are best for vehicles such as school buses and utility trucks that return to a central location and can fuel while parked for an extended period. Among all options, they are least expensive to build and staff, requiring no full-time attendant. But extended fueling time is needed because time-fill stations have relatively small compressors and no CNG storage.  ing similar to that provided by conventional liquid fuel stations. CNG storage vessels arranged in cascades, or banks, are used to quickly fill vehicles during peak fueling times, when the compressors alone cannot meet demand. During off-peak times, the compressors refill the CNG storage cascades. These stations are suitable for fueling light-duty vehicles at public access stations where use patterns are random. They are also suitable for fueling fleets of light-duty vehicles, such as taxis and police cars, that require a fast fill and have peak fueling periods. Cascade fast-fill stations are not appropriate for continuous, high-volume fueling because the compressors are not large enough to provide a fast fill once the CNG storage has been depleted. Most of the several hundred public access CNG stations in North America use a cascade fast-fill system. Buffered fast-fill stations provide fast, continuous, highvolume fueling. Relatively large compressors run continuously during fueling, filling vehicles and, in the interval between vehicles, a CNG storage buffer. The storage buffer provides CNG to vehicles at the beginning of the fueling cycle and allows the compressor to run for long periods. Unlike CNG storage in cascade fast-fill systems, buffer storage is not separated into separate banks. Buffered fast-fill stations are suitable for quickly fueling large numbers of heavy-duty, high-fuel-capacity vehicles, such as transit buses. Vehicle refueling appliances (VRAs) are  Time Fill Gas dryer Compressor  Temperature compensation unit  Cascade Fast-Fill Gas dryer Compressor  Storage tanks Fuel dispenser Temperature compensation unit  like small time-fill stations, containing a small compressor and other equipment within a single unit.

Garman Assistant Secretary YDROGEN F UTURE U.S. Department of Energy N HIS  C  I  I  STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS in January, President Bush announced that the United States would ""lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.""  And of course, we will continue support for our Clean Cities Program--a unique, voluntary approach supporting more than 80 local coalitions that deploy alternative fuel vehicles and promote the supporting infrastructure. Some have expressed concern that our enthusiasm for hydrogen and its role as a future transportation fuel signals a lack of regard for the alternative fuels of the present. Let me assure you that this is not the case. Natural gas, ethanol, biodiesel, propane, and electricity are important fuels that can clearly lessen our dependence on imported petroleum. The President himself drives an LPG-powered vehicle at his ranch in Texas that we at DOE call ""Propane One."" However, these alternative technologies, as important as they are, cannot completely eliminate our dependence on imported petroleum as hydrogen eventually can. Why do I say that? Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth, and it can be derived from a wide variety of feedstocks (including water and biomass) using a variety of methods. This potential diversity of supply is key in helping us to eventually eliminate the use of petroleum in the light-duty transportation sector. But where will the hydrogen come from? Today, most of our hydrogen--used in a variety of applications from petroleum refining to food processing--is produced from natural gas. Currently, the United States produces an estimated 9 million metric tons of hydrogen annually from natural gas. We estimate that it would take 40 million metric tons of hydrogen annually to power a fleet of 100 million light-duty vehicles. We also expect that much of the hydrogen produced during the early years of hydrogen vehicle use will come from natural gas that is distributed to fueling stations using established infrastructure, and reformed into hydrogen at the station. Several such fueling stations are in place today in the United States, Europe, and Japan. It is noteworthy that natural gas, an alternative fuel that our Clean Cities Coalition partners are very familiar with, is likely to play a central role in the transition to the hydrogen economy. And the clean air benefits of natural gas are not lost in the conversion to hydrogen. Compared to a gasoline vehicle, a fuel cell vehicle using compressed hydrogen reformed from natural gas uses 50 percent less energy and emits 60 percent less carbon dioxide from ""well to wheels."" Included in that calculation are the energy use needed to extract and distribute natural  Elaborating on his vision for a hydrogen future a few days later, the President noted, ""By being bold and innovative... we can change our dependence on foreign sources of energy... Let us promote hydrogen fuel cells as a way to advance into the 21st Century."" Building on the FreedomCAR initiative announced a year earlier, the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative seeks to develop the technologies we need to free our light-duty cars and trucks of foreign petroleum while we free our cities from the pollution that results from personal transportation. To be successful, these technologies must preserve the freedom of mobility and choice that Americans expect, and be economically successful in the marketplace. This is a dramatic, game-changing effort to remove the automobile from the environmental equation. Success in this endeavor would be the greatest success that our Clean Cities coalitions could hope for. But the fact that we are engaged in a long-term quest toward a hydrogen economy does not eliminate the need to maintain our efforts to reduce petroleum use in the near term. In April, the Bush Administration increased corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty trucks for the first time since the 1996 model year. This increase, covering pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles in the 20052007 model years, constitutes the greatest increase in fuel economy standards in the last 20 years. This new standard alone will save 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of the trucks involved. The Administration also proposed tax credits for hybrid vehicles in the President's National Energy Plan and in the two federal budgets submitted since. We are optimistic that Congress will pass such a tax credit this year as part of a comprehensive energy bill, and we are encouraged that more automakers will be offering hybrid models over the next few model years. We are also supporting language in the comprehensive energy bill establishing a renewable fuels standard projected to more than double ethanol and biodiesel use by 2012.  8   ""By being bold and innovative... we can change our dependence on foreign sources of energy... Let us promote hydrogen fuel cells as a way to advance into the 21st Century."" --P RESIDENT  G  EORGE  W. B  USH  ,S  TAT E O F T H E  U  NION  A  DDRESS  , 2003   We must develop new technologies for storing hydrogen onboard a vehicle to enable range between fueling of better than 300 miles.  We must develop needed codes and standards. There are more than 40,000 different code jurisdictions in the United States, not to mention the international standards and protocols related to a new hydrogen fueling infrastructure.  We must continue the progress we have made in associated vehicle technologies such as hybrid drive, lightweight materials, energy storage, and power electronics. For almost past two years, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has worked to develop and refine the ""technology roadmap"" leading to the hydrogen economy. This process has involved industry, academia, and public interest groups. Our eventual success in this effort will not be brought about by the DOE working in isolation. Instead, we will work closely with other federal agencies, industry, and coalitions of stakeholders. That is where Clean Cities has a vital role. We envision the Clean Cities structure as an important part of the effort to help inform the public about the possibilities offered by hydrogen transportation, and to help accelerate the deployment of this technology when it is ready for the marketplace. As our FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiative efforts grow, and as more hybrid vehicles come into the marketplace, Clean Cities should consider how to position itself to encourage the use of alternative fuels AND hybrid technologies as we make the transition to a hydrogen future, and to help drive that change. The hydrogen future presents options, benefits, and opportunities that can be dramatic. In his State of the Union address the President spoke of a ""child born today"" having the chance to drive a practical, affordable, pollution-free vehicle when he is ready to purchase his first car. I am determined that my new son, literally born within hours of the time those words were penned, will have that opportunity. I can think of no greater legacy for the next generation. David Garman is DOE's Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). Within the EERE Office is DOE's Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program (OWIP), headed by John Millhone. OWIP supports various programs and initiatives including the Alternative Fuels Data Center and the Clean Cities Program, directed by Shelley Launey.  gas, its conversion to hydrogen, the compression of hydrogen, etc. Carbon dioxide and only trace elements of criteria pollutants would be emitted at the station's reformer--the vehicles would emit nothing but water. As the demand for hydrogen grows, centralized hydrogen production will be possible using a wider variety of feedstocks and methods. For example, hydrogen can be produced through the gasification of agricultural residues, the electrolysis of water, or through thermochemical water splitting using high temperature solar or nuclear energy. It is also possible to gasify coal, employing capture and sequestration technologies to avoid emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants. We want to be able to refine these technologies so that hydrogen production can occur on a zero, nearzero or net-zero basis. We do not intend to taint hydrogen, a clean energy carrier, by producing it using methods that would not significantly reduce air emissions overall. But formidable technology barriers stand between us and our vision of practical, affordable hydrogen fuel cell transportation:  We must lower by a factor of 4 the cost of producing and delivering hydrogen from its most affordable source, natural gas.  The cost of producing hydrogen using other methods is even higher, so we must lower the costs and improve the efficiency of other production-related technologies such as renewable electricity generation, electrolysis, carbon capture and storage, biomass gasification, and photolytics, just to name a few.  We must lower the cost of fuel cells by a factor of 10.  9   Niche Markets Fuels for Schools The nation's 600,000 school buses represent a huge niche market opportunity for alternative fueling. Perhaps 99 percent of them are currently diesel fueled. But increasingly, CNG, propane, and biodiesel are making the grade. School districts rarely operate fleets regulated by EPAct, which applies to state and federal agencies. Often their fueling choices are influenced by local regulating bodies such as California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, which effectively mandates alternative fueling in many school district fleets. Many districts are motivated purely by a desire to reduce emissions and protect the health of the 24 million students who ride buses to school every day in the United States. To help them persuade colleagues to make the switch, Clean Cities is assembling an Alternative Fuel School Bus Resource Kit, to be available on the Web this summer. The kit will include customizable PowerPoint presentations explaining the how and why of alternative fuel school buses; a financial cost comparison of CNG and propane versus diesel; and lists of school bus manufacturers and other industry resources. Also included will be fact sheets providing case studies of successful alternative fuel use. Those stories are excerpted here: The loans and equipment costs for these vehicles are funded through savings that result from using natural gas rather than gasoline or diesel. The district typically uses the equivalent of 26,000 gallons of gasoline and 29,000 gallons of diesel per month. Overall savings average $300 $500 per vehicle per year. The district has made it policy to consider AFVs first when purchasing new vehicles. ""The switch to natural gas has saved the district around $1.6 million if you consider fuel costs, engine longevity, and other matters,"" says Larry Rodriquez, a vehicle technician at the district. ""It has definitely been worth it.""  Biodiesel for the Bluegrass State Kentucky Schools In 2002, as part of a pilot project, the Kentucky Division of Energy provided grants to offset the incremental cost of biodiesel for several school districts. Compared with diesel, the incremental cost of B20 supplied to the schools was about $0.20 per gallon. The incremental cost of B2, which is 2 percent biodiesel, was about $0.02 per gallon. Within four Kentucky school systems, 225 buses use B20 and 100 use B2 (see table). The project will displace approximately 45,000 gallons of diesel fuel, resulting in emission reductions of 150 pounds of particulate matter, 160 pounds of sulfur dioxide, 200 pounds of hydrocarbons, and 1,800 pounds of carbon monoxide, according to the Kentucky Clean Fuels Coalition. The school systems have been pleased with the biodiesel. Drivers say it has less odor than regular diesel. At least two school systems have indicated they will continue to use biodiesel after the grant funding expires. The pilot project is scheduled to go through October 2003.

The buses transport 18,000 students daily and consume 320,000 diesel equivalent gallons of fuel while traveling 1.6 million miles per year. The corporation began converting to natural gas in 1986 because of the price instability of gasoline and diesel fuel. It invested almost $250,000 in the project. This investment was repaid in a single year by fuel cost savings. The corporation currently has more than 60 CNG fueling pumps for its natural gas buses. It is also investigating the use of B20 in its diesel buses.  Savings Add Up Tulsa Public Schools, Oklahoma In 1990, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce asked the Tulsa Public Schools to participate in a two-year pilot program to test the viability of alternative fuels. The district converted 24 school buses to natural gas and continued to convert buses after the pilot period ended, assisted by several bond issues and zero-interest loans from the State of Oklahoma and support from local utility Oklahoma Natural Gas. The fleet continued to grow and now includes 190 dedicated CNG vehicles, including buses, trucks, and cars.  French Fries to Fuel Clark County School District, Nevada The Clark County School District operates almost all its 1,186 buses on B20, which is a cost-effective way to improve the safety of its 246,000 students, according to district vehicle maintenance coordinator Frank Giordano. ""It was our obligation to explore alternatives that would help clean up the exhaust from our diesel engines,"" says Giordano. ""We worked with the engine manufacturer to  10   savings of $1,100 per bus in fuel and maintenance costs relative to diesel buses, giving a conversion payback time of 1.4 years. In addition, the time between oil changes is extended with propane, and engines using propane have a longer life expectancy. Safety is another key area where Northside's propane buses excel. More than 80 million miles have been logged by its propane buses since 1980, with no major incidents resulting from fuel system malfunctions. The district is committed to operating all its vehicles on propane and plans to increase its fleet to 448 propane buses by 2005.  100 Percent Propane More than 24 million students ride buses to school every day in the United States. An Alternative Fuel School Bus Resource Kit will be posted on the Clean Cities Web site.  include its new generation of cleaner burning diesel engines, and got its consent to run them on biodiesel."" Because the local area lacks a supply of soybeans, the traditional biodiesel feedstock, suppliers turned to one of the area's plentiful resources: cooking grease from restaurants and casinos. Clark County restaurants produce twice the national average of three gallons of grease per resident per year. A joint venture between Nevada-based Haycock Petroleum and Biodiesel Industries supplies the greasebased biodiesel to the school district.  Portland Public Schools, Oregon Portland Public Schools started using propane buses in 1983 because of concerns about increasing conventional fuel prices and stricter air quality regulations. Today all the district's 325 buses run on propane, consuming 1.4 million diesel gallon equivalents of fuel while traveling 3.5 million miles per year. Some of the district's support vehicles use propane as well. The district owns 85 small Type A school buses--built on cutaway van chassis--which are converted to propane for $3,000$4,000 per vehicle. A contractor serving the district owns 240 larger propane buses, and fuels its buses from propane storage tanks at its site. The district's buses are fueled by a truck that transports fuel from the contractor 's tanks to school property. This eliminates the need for additional storage. The propane buses have earned high marks for safety. In a collision with another vehicle, a bus was struck directly in the fuel tank area. The impact sheared the fuel line from the tank, but valves on the tank sealed immediately to contain the fuel. The tank was not ruptured, and no fire or explosion occurred. The buses have also received accolades for drivability, clean emissions, positive public perception, and reduced fuel and maintenance costs.  Clean and Quiet Lower Merion School District, Pennsylvania When its community complained about noise and pollution from diesel school buses, the Lower Merion School District responded. The district started to acquire natural gas buses in 1996 and now operates 68 CNG school buses and two Ford Ranger bi-fuel CNG pickups as support vehicles. It also has two fast-fill CNG stations. To date, the buses have logged more than 4 million miles and displaced 850,000 gallons of diesel. The district has built its fleet and infrastructure through successful applications for alternative fuel grants. It has received funding and technical support from the U.S. Department of Energy, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and PECO Energy. District officials say they would like to convert their entire fleet of 79 school buses and 30 support vehicles to natural gas.  CNG Clears the Air Hudson City Schools, Ohio The Hudson City Schools have used natural gas buses since the early 1980s and are currently operating 14 of their 44 buses on CNG. The proportion of CNG buses is down from 80 percent because of vehicle retirements, but the district is working to return its fleet to being 80 percent alternative fueled. Using alternative fuel buses is part of the district's good neighbor policy. CNG buses produce fewer emissions and odors than diesel buses. The odor reduction is especially noticeable when the buses idle at the beginning and end of each school day while waiting for students. The district owns a private CNG fueling station with slow-fill and fast-fill capabilities. Operating costs for its CNG buses have been roughly equal to the operating costs for its diesel buses.  Economical and Safe Northside Independent School District, Texas The Northside Independent School District has fueled its school buses and transportation service vehicles with propane since 1980, and now operates 430 propane buses, or 94 percent of its fleet. The buses travel nearly 8 million miles annually. Northside initially switched to propane because of its relatively low price in Texas. But the district found continuing economic benefits. An analysis showed annual  11   At the Pump Biofuels in Berkeley It's not just from the Midwest any more, as one California fleet adopts home-grown ethanol A fleet operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California includes approximately 35 flexiblefuel vehicles (FFVs) that can run on E85. By this summer, the laboratory will have a way of making sure that they do, when it opens its own E85 fueling station. The site will include one fuel dispenser and one 4,000gallon aboveground storage tank. Initially it will dispense about 500 gallons of E85 per month, says site services manager Bill Llewellyn. That figure will double in the next two years as the lab doubles its FFV fleet. ""We made the decision to go almost completely to E85 with our AFV fleet,"" says Llewellyn. As the operator of a regulated federal fleet, the Berkeley lab considered various ways to go about meeting its mandates. Under EPAct (the Energy Policy Act of 1992), federal fleets must make AFVs a substantial percentage of their vehicle acquisitions. Under Executive Order 13149, regulated fleets have been ordered to reduce their petroleum consumption by 20 percent between 1999 and 2005. ""We ran electric vehicles for years,"" says Llewellyn. From the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the lab leased approximately 20 Ford Ranger pickups and  NEVC and GM Launch E85 Campaign GM and the NEVC have announced a two-year multimillion dollar campaign to increase the use of ethanol in cars and trucks. The campaign will spread the word about E85 through advertising, direct-mail, online activities, and dealer-distributed information. The promotion effort will begin in six key states: Missouri, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan, and Illinois, according to NEVC. ""E85 alternative fuel is only beginning to become available in many areas,"" said Gary Herwick, director of alternative fuels for General Motors. ""GM is manufacturing E85-compatible vehicles and we are encouraging industry and consumers to do their parts by continuing to develop the E85 infrastructure, and by using E85."" All 2003 full-size GM sport utility vehicles equipped with the 5.3liter Vortec engine are E85 capable, including the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL. Also available as FFVs are the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks. FFVs from other automakers include the Taurus, Explorer, and Ranger from Ford Motor Company, and DaimlerChrysler's Dodge Stratus, Chrysler Sebring, and many minivans.  Chrysler EPIC minivans, all electric powered. But when their leases expired, GSA was unable to continue its arrangement with Ford, and the vehicles were called back. The lab also considered gaseous fuels. CNG was ruled out because the fueling site sits on a hilltop, and extreme pressurization would have been required to pump the fuel uphill. Available LPG-fueled trucks would have been impractical due to cargo carrying incompatibility. E85 stations are most common in the Midwest, where the corn crop is abundant. On the West Coast, historically they have been extremely rare. But the importance of ethanol is increasing in California, with a coming ban on MTBE as an oxygen-boosting gasoline additive. Ethanol will be its replacement in most cases. Fuel at the Berkeley site will contain ethanol produced not from corn, but as a by-product of whey at a cheese factory in southern California. (Ethanol from other atypical sources may create new E85 fueling opportunities in the United States. In Hawaii, for example, ethanol producers are following the lead of Brazil, using sugarcane as a feedstock.) The Berkeley site will accept payment only from GSAissued fleet credit cards. It will be open to vehicles operated by the DOE office in Oakland, the University of California at Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It will not be publicly accessible. Much of the funding for the facility will come from DOE, in the form of an Alternative Fuel Refueling Infrastructure grant in the amount of $81,361. The lab will contribute approximately $40,000 to construction of the site.  Ham and Eggs and E85 AFVs and alternative fueling are often said to be subject to a ""chicken-and-egg"" problem. What must come first? Are potential vehicle buyers waiting until more fueling stations are established? Or are the fuel suppliers hesitating, hoping to see more vehicles on the road? In the world of E85, the chicken-and-egg model no longer applies, says Phil Lampert of the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition (NEVC). ""What we have now is a ham-and-egg problem,"" he says. ""The chicken is merely involved; the pig is fully committed."" Fully committed to alternative fueling, he says, are many fleets at the state and federal levels. Such fleets have already bought, or have committed to buy, vehicles in large numbers. The U.S. Department of Defense, for example, has implemented FFVs and other AFVs in most branches of the military. Counting individual motorists, more than 2 million people now drive FFVs, and the number is growing rapidly. ""The vehicles are out there,"" says Lampert. What must follow are more stations selling E85, and more awareness of the fuel among people whose cars can use it.  12   From the States Made in Maine L.L.Bean tests biodiesel in its own fleet as it supports propane power in a National Park Already a strong voice for Maine's environment, outdoor clothing and equipment retailer L.L.Bean is becoming one of the state's alternative fuel leaders. The company is also on the road to becoming a Clean Cities stakeholder. In April, L.L.Bean began testing biodiesel (B20) in three tractor-trailers that shuttle goods between warehouses in the company's headquarters of Freeport, Maine. The three trucks consume about 1,000 gallons of fuel per month. The fuel is supplied by Frontier Energy, based in South China, Maine. Frontier installed a skid-mounted B20 tank and dispenser at one of the warehouses. L.L.Bean is the first major Maine company to test market biodiesel in a distribution fleet according to Frontier. Clean Cities assisted L.L.Bean with the biodiesel project. ""We knew about L.L.Bean's commitment to the environment and encouraged them to explore alternative fuel options,"" said Maine Clean Communities (MC2) coordinator Steven Linnell. ""We helped bring the right people together to get the project started, and we were a resource for alternative fuel information."" L.L.Bean is working on a memorandum of understanding to become a stakeholder in the MC2 coalition. ""L.L.Bean has a long history of being an advocate for environmental stewardship,"" says company spokesperson Rich Donaldson. ""We support conservation through corporate giving as well as the promotion of volunteerism."" L.L.Bean has had a corporate recycling program for many years. Employees also recycle regularly as part of their With substantial support from L.L.Bean, propane-powered Island Explorer buses ease pollution and traffic congestion in Acadia National Park. Company driver Greg Barker fuels up with B20.  daily routines, and recycling is increasing each year. ""In 2002, L.L.Bean recycled 81 percent of its waste, such as packaging, boxes, and paper,"" says Donaldson. In addition to the environmental benefits of biodiesel, the company chose the fuel because it is renewable and domestically manufactured. There may be economic and operational benefits as well: onsite fueling eliminates the 10-mile trip the trucks had been taking to fuel at a retail diesel station. L.L.Bean also plans to use propane-powered light-duty service trucks. ""We're excited to be moving forward with these alternative fuel initiatives,"" says Donaldson. The company's efforts may already be having a positive ripple effect. The town of Freeport is considering biodiesel for public works vehicles and school buses and may cooperate with L.L.Bean on fueling infrastructure. These alternative fuel projects follow the company's $1 million donation to Friends of Acadia in support of Acadia National Park's Island Explorer--a fleet of 17 propane-powered buses that transport passengers during the park's busiest period, from mid-June through midOctober. L.L.Bean says the buses have cut carbon monoxide emissions in the park by 33 percent.

A $1.4 million CMAQ grant has been designated to fund 11 Long Island projects, which the coalition estimates will displace more than 200,000 gallons of petroleum fuels annually. The projects are diverse, ranging from an electric vehicle charging station for a real estate business to a publicly accessible CNG fueling station at a retail gasoline station. In one unique project, the Centerport Fire Department is obtaining two CNG fire trucks, a CNG ambulance, and an onsite CNG fueling station with a credit card reader. This recent award brings to more than $4.5 million in CMAQ funding that the coalition has participated in designating for AFV acquisition and infrastructure development (see related article, AFN Vol. 6, No. 3, p. 15). Sweet sorrow. Beverly Miller, coordinator of the Salt Lake City Clean Cities Coalition, reluctantly relinquishes her natural gas Honda Civic GX. Miller was named Clean Cities Outstanding Coordinator in 2000, and was later awarded use of the Civic for this honor. The car will go next to 2002 Outstanding Coordinator Tim Gerlach of Minnesota's Twin Cities Clean Cities Coalition. To replace her cherished Civic, Miller hopes to purchase a bi-fuel CNG pickup at a General Services Administration vehicle auction.  AFV Auction Set for 2003 Conference Tucson Clean Cities Coalition/PIX 12497  Clean Cities and the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) are collaborating on plans to bring AFVs directly to program stakeholders, with an auction set to occur on May 20 at this year 's Clean Cities Conference. Scheduling of the ninth annual conference, May 1821 in Palm Springs, California, coincided with plans for publication of this issue of Alternative Fuel News. Set to be auctioned are 25 used AFVs including many CNG- and E85-fueled models. Most are from model years 19962002 and driven fewer than 50,000 miles. The auction list includes the Ford Contour and Taurus, Dodge Caravan, and Ford and Dodge trucks. Vehicles will be on display in the expo hall throughout the conference. Participants are encouraged to attend the fast-paced auction to bid, buy, or just see how the process works. GSA holds auctions nationwide as part of its commitment to manage assets, including vehicles for the federal government. More information and an AFV auction calendar are at www.autoauctions.gsa.gov.  Tucson residents celebrated alternative fueling at their own AFV Day in March. The Tucson Clean Cities Coalition hosted the event, which was part of the Clean Air Fiesta sponsored by the Pima County Department of Environmental Quality, City of Tucson, and Pima Association of Governments. Showcased were E85, CNG, LPG, biodiesel, and hybrid-electric vehicles. Crowd favorites included biodiesel- and CNG-powered dump trucks and an ethanol race car (shown) built by University of Arizona students. Special emphasis was placed on natural gas to build awareness about the recent opening of Tucson's first public CNG station. Local radio and television stations covered the event, which took place at Tucson's Foothills Mall.  14  Salt Lake City Clean Cities Coalition/PIX 12512   On the Web What's New, What's Happening on the AFDC and Clean Cities Sites?

The Middle Georgia coalition was designated on April 17 at the Macon Centreplex. About 150 people attended the designation, including U.S. Representative Jim Marshall, Macon Mayor C. Jack Ellis, DOE's Tom Gross, and Major General Donald J. Wetekam, Commander of Robins Air Force Base. ""The hydrogen vehicles of the future will certainly reduce our dependency on foreign oil,"" Gross said. ""But, we can take immediate steps to solve the problem of oil dependency today, with alternative fuels. Clean Cities coalitions are the pathfinders--they're leading the way."" The New York City coalition was designated on Earth Day, April 22, at City Hall Park. DOE Assistant Secretary David Garman, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman, and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined about 150 people at the ceremony. ""The New York City Clean Cities Coalition has made great progress in promoting the use of alternative fuel and alternative fuel vehicles,"" Garman said. ""Their efforts to increase the use of domestically produced, cleaner burning alternative fuels such as ethanol, natural gas, propane, biodiesel, and electricity are helping to reduce our nation's dependence on imported oil, strengthen energy security, and improve our environment.""
