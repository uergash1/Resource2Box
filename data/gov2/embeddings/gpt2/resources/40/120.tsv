Meet the Fire Chief    Board of Directors    Budget    Department History    Organizational Chart    What is a Special District?            Department Stats    Enduring Goals    Agendas/Minutes                             ""Independent, special purpose governmental units (other than school       districts) that exist as separate entities with substantial administrative       and fiscal independence from general-purpose governments"" (U.S.       Census Bureau, 1994, p.23).         ""Legally constituted governmental entities…that are neither       cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, or schools"" (Office of the       California State Controller, 1994, p.2).         What does a special district do?        Special districts fulfill a needed function, as determined by a local       constituency. For example, the League of Women Voters identified the       following types of special districts: Airport districts, hospital       districts, levee districts, community service districts, municipal utility       districts, public utility districts, recreation and park districts,       utility districts, sanitary districts, water districts, resource       conservation districts, water storage districts.         Additionally, special districts are formed to provide the following       services: mosquito abatement, library services, road maintenance, drainage       functions, and fire services (emergency mitigation).         Are all special districts the same?        1. Dependent district- The district is governed by a city council or       county board of supervisors, directly or indirectly.        Joint Powers Authority or Joint Powers Agreement (JPA).        2. Independent district-The district is governed by an elected board.       Created by residents who see an unfilled need or service.        Independent special districts can determine its own budget, levy        taxes, collect charges, and issue debt.        3. Enterprise districts- These districts are able to charge fees for some       or all of their services, i.e.  garbage sewer, water.        4. Nonenterprise districts- Generally do not charge for their services,       i.e. fire protection, libraries.        5. Combination districts-The preponderance of the fees charged does not       make a significant portion of the district's revenues.        6. Single purpose district-The district provides a single service or       function, i.e. street lighting.        7. Multipurpose district-The district provides at least two services, i.e.       fire districts provide fire suppression, EMS, hazardous materials       mitigation, technical rescue, fire prevention services, and arson       investigation.         How did special districts get their start?        Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom in 1500 (Smith, 1974).        George Washington's secretary of the Treasury used ""mixed       corporations"" to finance banks, canals, turnpikes, and bridges.        During the 19th century American employed special transportation districts       for toll roads and canals.        In California the first two irrigation districts were formed in 1887 under       the Wright Act.        The Depression caused a dramatic increase in special districts so the       States could evade debt limitations, thus allowing them to participate in       national public works projects.        During WWII a scarcity of materials slowed special district growth, but       postwar development pressures stimulated the expansion of special       districts.         What are the principal types of special districts?        Fire protection - 18.1%        Housing and community development - 12.0%        Water - 11.4%        (1994)         How many special districts are there in California, compared to       other forms of government?        58 counties        470 cities        380 redevelopment agencies        1,100 school districts        4800 special districts        (1992)         What laws govern special districts?        All federal and state laws apply.        Additionally, the following laws are particularly important to special       districts.        Cortese-Knox Act        Brown Act        Bergeson Fire District law         What controversies surround the discussion of special districts?        Government accountability        Run away taxation        Uncoordinated government service delivery        Consolidation/merger/annexation        Hidden government        Responsiveness         How can I learn more about special districts?

With its proactive systems evaluation approach, CQI       at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District has changed the way quality of       service is assessed and improved. CQI recognizes that the majority of       problems result from a failure in the process of providing the service, as       opposed to being attributable to the providers themselves.         The American River College EMS Training Program and the Peer Review       Committee are the driving forces behind the Continuous Quality Improvement       Process at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. The Peer Review Committee reviews       all PCRs (Patient Care Reports) produced by district personnel and       identifies individual, agency, and system trends. The committee then works       as a team in helping to reduce or eliminate any actions or items that do       meet district standards.         Rather than focusing on individual problems or working in a crisis       management mode, CQI focuses on providing quality service that meets the       customer's needs by emphasizing Prospective Training and identifying       System Issues. The review and work in the CQI process involves       Prospective, Immediate, and Retrospective supervision and review.         The essence of the CQI Process at Sacramento Metropolitan Fire       District is proactive training, immediate and proactive feedback, and       non-punitive respective review of medical care delivered by District       Personnel leading to constant review and improvement of EMS Policies and       Procedures.

The Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) is a raster image of a scanned USGS topographic map including the collar information. The source maps for DRGs were georeferenced to the UTM grid, but images DRGs for California are available in Albers equal area projection, see the  projection information  .   A DRG is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS, as a means to perform quality assurance on other digital products, and as a source for the collection and revision of DLG data. DRG's can also be merged with other digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to produce a hybrid digital file.   Series Information   There are multiple series of DRGs for different scales. The 1x2 degree series is at a scale of 1:250K. The 30x60 minute series is at a scale of 1:100K, and the 7.5 minute series is at 1:24K. Additionally, there are some 1:25K scale maps that are included in this distribution as belonging to the 7.5 minute series.   For the 1x2 degree series, there are 41 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. These DRGs were originally obtained from the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG).   For the 30x60 minute series, there are 127 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. These DRGs were originally obtained from the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG).   For the 7.5 minute series, there are 2853 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. Statewide DRG production was performed by the State of California, Stephen P. Teale Data Center, GIS Solutions Group (Teale). Additional acknowlegdements include: Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES): compilation of DRG quad dates and other attributes; California Department of Fish and Game, Information Technology Branch: non-standard quad boundaries, quad currentness year information and enhanced index compilation.   Obtaining DRGs   Mr Sid Versions of  drgs  contributed by  CA Dept. Fish and Game   All California Digital Raster Graphics are available via an FTP site at  ftp://casil.ucdavis.edu/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg , via HTTP at  http://casil.ucdavis.edu/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg  (this site), or the  interactive map interface . In the case of the HTTP interface, client side image maps allow interactive access to datasets.   In addition, the drgs are mirrored at:  http://casil-mirror1.ceres.ca.gov/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg/ . Also, there is an additional web interface available from  CaSIL  .   The map identifiers are organized into 1x1 degree blocks covering the state. Within these blocks individual maps, and ancillary data are located in packages (compressed tar files). The table below shows these blocks, along with the number or 1:250K, 1:100K and 1:24K maps within that block.   The individual map packages follow this naming convention: drg- [usgs-identifier] -[un|tr]-alb.tar.gz. drg specifies this is a USGS Digital Raster Graphic. [usgs-identifier] specifies the USGS identifier for the quadrangle as defined by  Standardized Data Set Names  . For DRG Products. [un|tr] specifies whether the dataset is untrimmed (un), that is the map legend information is included or trimmed (tr), that is trimmed to the map neatline; and alb specifies the projection as defined in  CA Projection  .   Further Information   Information about the California DRGs can be found at  About California DRGs  .   Information about the projection used by the DRGS can be found at  CA Projection  .

The Council is generally composed of one member from the               public wildlife agency in each state and province in the western United               States, Canada, and Mexico.                            Waterfowl use four major migratory routes (Pacific, Central, Mississippi,               and Atlantic flyways) in North America. Because of the unique biological               characteristics and relative number of hunters in these regions, state and               federal wildlife agencies adopted the flyway structure for administering               migratory game bird resources within the United States. Each flyway has its               own council.                            Flyway councils have responsibilities in the annual process of setting                migratory bird hunting regulations within the United States and conduct               and contribute to migratory bird research and management throughout the                United States, Canada, and Mexico.                            In the U.S., the Pacific Flyway includes Alaska, Arizona, California,               Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and those portions of Colorado,               Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming west of the Continental Divide.

You may also find this extension in the Arcview Samples/ext directory.    This extension has a problem in the form menu.  The default spheroid is listed as  Clarke 1866 , which is correct for the Teale Albers projection, however unless you pull this menu down and redundantly select  Clarke 1866 , the menu passes  Sphere  to the projection engine, and the resulting projection is incorrect.   The following script will either append the Teale Albers projection to the system-wide default.prj ($AVHOME/etc/default.prj) or create or append to a user default.prj ($HOME/default.prj) file.  This makes  Teale Albers  one of the selectable standard projections.     ' script to create Teale Albers projection for default.prj ' default.prj resides either in $AVHOME/etc or $HOME.

The Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) is a raster image of a scanned USGS topographic map including the collar information. The source maps for DRGs were georeferenced to the UTM grid, but images DRGs for California are available in Albers equal area projection, see the  projection information  .   A DRG is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS, as a means to perform quality assurance on other digital products, and as a source for the collection and revision of DLG data. DRG's can also be merged with other digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to produce a hybrid digital file.   Series Information   There are multiple series of DRGs for different scales. The 1x2 degree series is at a scale of 1:250K. The 30x60 minute series is at a scale of 1:100K, and the 7.5 minute series is at 1:24K. Additionally, there are some 1:25K scale maps that are included in this distribution as belonging to the 7.5 minute series.   For the 1x2 degree series, there are 41 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. These DRGs were originally obtained from the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG).   For the 30x60 minute series, there are 127 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. These DRGs were originally obtained from the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG).   For the 7.5 minute series, there are 2853 images covering the state of California and immediately adjacent areas. Statewide DRG production was performed by the State of California, Stephen P. Teale Data Center, GIS Solutions Group (Teale). Additional acknowlegdements include: Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES): compilation of DRG quad dates and other attributes; California Department of Fish and Game, Information Technology Branch: non-standard quad boundaries, quad currentness year information and enhanced index compilation.   Obtaining DRGs   Mr Sid Versions of  drgs  contributed by  CA Dept. Fish and Game   All California Digital Raster Graphics are available via an FTP site at  ftp://casil.ucdavis.edu/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg , via HTTP at  http://casil.ucdavis.edu/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg  (this site), or the  interactive map interface . In the case of the HTTP interface, client side image maps allow interactive access to datasets.   In addition, the drgs are mirrored at:  http://casil-mirror1.ceres.ca.gov/casil/gis.ca.gov/drg/ . Also, there is an additional web interface available from  CaSIL  .   The map identifiers are organized into 1x1 degree blocks covering the state. Within these blocks individual maps, and ancillary data are located in packages (compressed tar files). The table below shows these blocks, along with the number or 1:250K, 1:100K and 1:24K maps within that block.   The individual map packages follow this naming convention: drg- [usgs-identifier] -[un|tr]-alb.tar.gz. drg specifies this is a USGS Digital Raster Graphic. [usgs-identifier] specifies the USGS identifier for the quadrangle as defined by  Standardized Data Set Names  . For DRG Products. [un|tr] specifies whether the dataset is untrimmed (un), that is the map legend information is included or trimmed (tr), that is trimmed to the map neatline; and alb specifies the projection as defined in  CA Projection  .

Developed for the California Resources Agency's Legacy Project, this dataset depicts ownership features as submitted by major public, trust, and non-profit groups in the state. This dataset is an update to the Legacy Project's govconfee03_3 geographic dataset, which built on a prior effort by the USBR to map public lands (GOVLANDS dataset).   Purpose   The California Legacy Project is an initiative by the California Resources Agency to help state agencies and the state's conservation partners make better decisions about how to conserve precious natural resources. This Public, Conservation and Trust Lands dataset is part of a number of geographic datasets developed for this initiative, and is intended to provide stakeholders in both the public and private sectors with a planning-level representation of ownership in California.   Supplemental Information   This is an INTERIM version, and is subject to review and update by contributing groups and/or agencies. It is intended to provide general ownership information for conservation planning purposes, and NOT FOR PARCEL OR PROPERTY MAPPING.
