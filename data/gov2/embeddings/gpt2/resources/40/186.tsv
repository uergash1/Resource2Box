We learned many of these fun facts searching over the internet, but we also used a book called ""Awesome Almanac Illinois,"" 1993 edition published by B&B Publishing, Inc. P.O. Box 393 Fontana, Wisconsin 53125.       The name ""Illinois"" came from the Algonquin word  Inini , meaning ""the men"" and ""accomplished."" The French later pronounced the word as  Illini  , and added  ois  to the ending. This made the name mean ""the tribe of accomplished (or superior) men.""     Illinois officially became a state on December 3, 1818. It was the 21st state to enter the union.     Illinois is 56,400 square miles thus making it the 24th largest state.     Illinois' widest point from east to west is 218 miles, and it's longest point from north to south is 385 miles.     Charles Mound in Jo Daviess County is Illinois' highest point at 1,235 feet. The lowest point in Illinois is the Mississippi River in Alexander County at 279 feet.     The geographic center of Illinois is 28 miles northeast of Springfield in Logan County.     Along with the ""Land of Lincoln,"" Illinois has had many other nicknames. Others include ""The Prairie State,"" ""The Garden of the West,"" ""The Corn State,"" ""The Hub of the Nation,"" and ""Crossroads of America.""     Illinois has 102 counties, with the largest being Cook County which is the home to the city of Chicago. Chicago is the nation's third largest city. The Illinois Blue Book, 1995-1996 edition lists the origins of each county's name.     In 1818 when Illinois first became a state, the population was 34,620. The 1990 census showed Illinois population at 11,430,602 which caused it to earn the title of the sixth most populous state in the United States.     The area known today as Illinois was discovered by French explorer Louis Jolliet and Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette in 1673.     Illinois is divided into 59 legislative districts and 118 representative districts. One member is elected from each of these districts, so there are 177 members of Illinois' General Assembly.     Illinois is bordered by five other states. They are Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and Wisconsin.     Illinois ranks third in the nation in the number of interstate highway miles.     Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American Women elected to the Senate is a native of Chicago.     In April 1955 Ray Kroc opened his first McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois.     Otto Schnering of Chicago owned a candy company called Curtiss Candy Company that had a candy called Kandy Kate. When he had a ""rename the candy bar contest"" the winner was ""Baby Ruth."" Although many people thought the candy bar was named for the baseball star Babe Ruth, it was really named after President Cleveland's oldest daughter, Ruth, who died of diphtheria at 12 years old.     In 1949 Chicago-O'Hare International airport was named to honor Lieutenant Commander Edward H. ""Butch"" O'Hare who was a navy pilot and received a Medal of Honor. O'Hare International airport is the busiest airport in the world, with a flight taking off or landing every 20 seconds."

This 1781 map, drawn by a military officer, shows the positions of the British, American, and French forces in early October 1781.    Map Collections  (1500-Present)                On  October 19,  1781, British General Charles Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, giving up almost 8000 men and any chance of winning the Revolutionary War.  Cornwallis had marched his army into the Virginia port town earlier that summer expecting to meet British ships sent from New York.  The ships never arrived.      In early October, some 17,000 American and French troops led by Generals  George Washington  and Jean-Baptiste Rochambeau surrounded British-occupied Yorktown.  Off the coast, French Admiral Fran√ßois de Grasse strategically positioned his naval fleet to control access to the town via the Chesapeake Bay and the York River.       The Franco-American siege exhausted the British army's supplies of food and ammunition.  With no hope for escape, Cornwallis agreed to the terms of Washington's  Articles of Capitulation , signing the document at  Moore House  on October 19.   Hours after the surrender, the general's defeated troops marched out of Yorktown to the tune ""The World Turned Upside Down.""

Cornwallis's surrender   at Yorktown effectively ended the Revolutionary War.  Lacking the financial resources to raise a new army, the British government appealed to the Americans for peace.  Almost two years later, on September 3, 1783, the signing of the  Treaty of Paris  brought the war to an end.

Elizabeth Blackwell   to Baroness Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron ,   letter concerning women's rights and the education of women physicians,   March 4, 1851.    Words and Deeds in American History         On  October 19 , 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell graduated from Geneva Medical College.  She was the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States.    Although Blackwell had been studying medicine on her own for four years when she began applying to medical schools, Geneva Medical College, a forerunner of Hobart College in upstate New York, was the only institution to accept her application.  She entered the college in 1847 and graduated the head of her class two years later, despite having endured ostracism by students and townspeople for daring to challenge barriers against women in the field of medicine.     In 1851, after completing graduate studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, Blackwell returned to the United States.  Barred from practicing in city hospitals, she opened a small dispensary in the tenement district of New York City.  In 1857, she and two other recent medical school graduates opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, a hospital staffed entirely by women.

GX086-26-14467764	"Commission News                  Artists' murals express cultural, community pride      I n a project between NIPSCO Industries and artists Tom Torluemke and Geoffry Smalley, a stark brick building has been transformed into a vibrant, colorful reminder of a city's cultural and community history.   The project began when Louis A. Ortiz, corporate art coordinator for  NIPSCO Industries , contacted Torluemke about the  Substation #9 project . NIPSCO was working with  Northern Indiana Arts Association  to turn the vacant two-story building into a community arts center. But Ortiz and NIPSCO President and CEO Gary Neale wanted this to be more than a renovation project. They agreed the building could do more than provide space and opportunity.    Geoffry Smalley (l) and Tom Torluemke (r) (NIPSCO photos)   A plan was formed to create murals on either end of the building. Torluemke says murals are ""a gift to the community and are intended to beautify and advertise that art is alive in Hammond.    The Hugging Wall (NIPSCO photo) Torluemke's design,  ""The Hugging Wall,""  covers the 30' x 50' east wall of the substation building and speaks to the importance of human love in holding communities together.   ""Being an inner city native of the near northside of Chicago, in a neighborhood that was mixed racially and culturally yet primarily blue collar industrial, I was witness to the closing of many factories.    The once secure lifestyles of my friends' families seemed to unravel. The only thing that seemed to hold these families together was the love they had for one another,"" Torluemke explained. ""This was the experience I found myself reliving in Hammond. The Hugging Wall tells the story of many different people, young and old, living in an intense urban industrial area. Trying to survive by sheer faith and the strength of love they feel for each other.""      Fellow artist Geoffry Smalley chose to relate Hammond's industry and growth in his west side mural. The city's industrial growth began with George H. Hammond's meat packing plant.   ""At the top right is a logo design using images of cows suggesting the packing plant, and a circular logo that says,  Recalling History (NIPSCO photo)   'Watch us Grow,'"" Smalley said. ""This logo serves a dual purpose, both telling of a historical event that shaped the city, as well as foreshadowing the shaping of the city through the arts and history.""

Buster               and  Beau  are the First Dogs of the Commonwealth.              Buster, a two-year-old Portugese Water Dog, moved with the family              from Alexandria. [ Look at another              picture of Buster. ] Beau, the newest addition to the family, is              a cock-a-poo ‚Äî a combination of a cocker spaniel and a poodle.              [ Look at another picture of Beau. ]              While the dogs mainly play in the back garden of the Mansion, they              sometimes greet guests at the front gate and inside the front door.              They love squeaky toys, chasing each other in the garden, and being              fed treats by the Mansion staff.               Secret Tunnels               Far beneath the green grass of Capitol Square lies a labyrinth,                or maze, of secret tunnels. Unseen by the public, these tunnels                connect multiple buildings, including the Capitol, the Executive                Mansion, and the Old State Library. Many exciting rumors have surrounded                the use of the tunnels, but the network was built in 1939 simply                as a way to run pipes for steam heat between the buildings. Today                the tunnels are used to house cabling for electricity and telecommunications,                as well as pipes for steam heat.                                           ¬†                                                     ¬† Governor's Web site                                Pied mont ¬†-¬†n. - A plateau region of the eastern United States extending from New York to Alabama between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain.

""I have fogotten the name of the first doctor who located at Moscow, but recall some of the stories told of him by some of the young fellows with whom I associated. In the '40s and early '50s, when the country was settling up, there was a great deal of sickness, mostly fever and ague, and the doctors used a great deal of calomel and quinine. One day when returning from a visit the Doctor saw that the horse he was riding was sick and that he shook like a person with the ague. The Doctor gave him a dose of calomel, then turned him out to graze. In a few days the horse lost every hair that was on his body and ran on the prairie north of town until another coat of hair grew. I do not know how long the Doctor remained at Moscow, but the town was without a doctor for some years previous to 1850. In the spring of that year a young doctor by the name of Baxter located here and remained until the spring of 1852, when he went to Oregon and during the summer of 1852 Dr. W. H. Baxter located here and remained until 1866, when he went to Wilton.""  I notice that this is all part of a lengthy quote from somewhere and I do not see any attribution, but I didn't look too hard ...  ---------------   http://www.geocities.com/arizona1900/Reynolds.html   The History of Mercer County 1882 mentions that ""... Charles Drury, returning in the fall of 1835, was married to Miss Nancy Prentice, who died eleven months after.  He then moved to Rock Island county and studied medicine with Dr. Reynolds, after which he married Mrs. Eliza McGreer, moved back and practiced medicine throughout the township, living upon what is known as the E. W. Mardock farm [NE Sec 3T15NR5W- see Eliza plat map].  He quit the practice of medicine in 1851 and moved to Oregon.""  This statement bears examination, as Eli Reynolds seems to have been in Iowa at that time.  The History of Rock Island County mentions only James, William, and Drury Reynolds as arriving shortly after 1837.  Without a date, it mentions, ""The first physician in the county was kind Doctor Reynolds, whose generous sympathy and hearty good will are remembered by the older generation.  His well-known figure was a welcome presence in many a sick chamber, and he never hesitated to journey forth in rain or snow, day or night, over the then almost impassable roads to succor those who were in need of his ministrations.  His type of physician is gone.  Perhaps the modern physician is a great improvement upon the old kind, but there are many who reposed a trust in the country doctor no twentieth century practitioner can command, for his word was absolute law, and in his hands reposed literally the keys to life or death.""   Charles and Eliza Brandenberg McGreer Drury are in Eliza Township in Mercer County in the 1850 census, indicating Charles studied in Rock Island County with Eli Reynolds before that date.   Perhaps one of the Drury links on this site might also be of interest.  Happy Thanksgiving!  Godspeed!

The war of the American Revolution had begun and the         thirteen colonies on the Atlantic seaboard had declared their         independence. The English plan of war combined campaigns along         the coast with raids, chiefly from Detroit, by English partisans         and Indians against the whole frontier. It seemed that the         latter movement would exterminate the settlers in the         ""Great Valley,"" or drive them back east of the         mountains.            George Rogers Clark conceived the desperate, but brilliant         plan of a far-reaching, offensive expedition for the occupation         of the posts held by the English north of the Ohio River. After         overcoming the most disheartening difficulties and         disappointments, he had led a force of less than two hundred         Virginians and Kentuckians from Corn Island (Louisville) to the         posts on the east side of the Mississippi below St. Louis. He         took them entirely by surprise and without resistance occupied         Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia.            At this time the only settlers in the Old Northwest were the         French. England had won this region only recently, in the French         and Indian War and by the Treaty of Paris. Before the outbreak         of the Revolution it had been part of the Province of Quebec. In         1778 France had entered into and alliance with the United States         and the French on the Mississippi and Wabash, apprised by Clark         of this alliance, gladly changed their allegiance to         ""Virginia and the Continental Congress.""            The Indians of this region, however, far outnumbered all the         French settlers; the English and Clark's force put together. If,         in 1778, as Clark reached Kaskaskia and Cahokia, they had         combined against him, his little force would have been quickly         destroyed. With bravado and apparent unconcern about the choice         the Indians might make, Clark told them about the war between         the United States and England, stated with apparent assurance         that the Americans, the ""Big Knives,"" were going to         drive the English out, and told the Indians to decide whether         they would fight the Americans or remain neutral.            His demeanor, his firmness, and his personal force decide the         issue, which, had it reached the decision of arms would have         been fatal. The Indians chose the white belt. During the rest of         the war, while many of the Indians joined the English in raids         upon the frontier, all of them held Clark in such awe that his         presence and even his name was worth an army of occupation. His         dealings with the French and with the Indians marked him as one         of the great statesmen of the Revolutionary period.

They mention many of the families I am trying to trace.  I now have a list of about a dozen families that left this four county area, Muscatine and Louisa counties, Iowa, and Rock Island and Mercer counties, Illinois, in 1852 and went to Oregon and California.  Most of them had connections in Indiana before they came to Iowa, and some as far back as Rev War times in Virginia and North Carolina.  There also seems to be a strong Mormon connection to many of the families.  I have been able to locate most of the families in Oregon.  I have not been able to find any records of Dr. Charles Drury however, until he ended up back in Iowa/Illinois.

Portfolio 4  of Prints and Photographs: An Illustrated Guide    The pseudonymous artist Arribas produced this poster  for two Spanish labor organizations,  Union General de Trabajo  and  Confederacion Nacional de Trabajo , to express indignation at Franco's foreign-backed aggression.             The Spanish Civil War began on  July 17 , 1936 as a series of military insurrections throughout the country. Because the Spanish Civil War was the first major military contest between left-wing forces and Fascists, it has been called the first chapter of World War II.  The Republicans fought to maintain the Republic while the Nationalists sought to restore the monarchy.    Because the Spanish Civil War represented a major threat to international political equilibrium, Americans discussed and watched closely the events of the conflict.  Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Spanish soldiers and civilians died from war or war-engendered disease and starvation and thousands of Spaniards became refugees.  The situation forced many Americans to question America's post-World War I non-interventionist policy.     The Republicans, or Loyalists, received aid from France, the Soviet Union, and Mexico.  Sixty thousand members of the International Brigades, some 2,800 of whom were men and women from the United States, volunteered their services.  During the war, the Nationalists received troops, tanks, and planes from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Germany field-tested some of its most important artillery in Spain prior to World War II.

The ten students of the college met for their first classes, conducted in Latin and Greek, in a schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church at Broadway and Wall Streets.     The early college educated a number of American patriots and intellectuals including several members of the  Continental Congress .  Among its first students and trustees were  Robert R.

As I searched                            the house looking for tennis balls and bones, I was                            surprised at how familiar the place smelled. It was                            as if I had been there before.                           I                            nudged my owner, President Bush, on the ankle and he                            said to me, ""Well, Spotty, how does it feel to be living                            again in the same house where you were born?""                                                      Then it all made dog sense. This big house is the White House, the place where I was born on March 17, 1989. My mother, Millie, took care of me and my brothers and sisters before President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush took me to their house in Texas.                                                      Today,                            my owner lives in this house, and he has a new name.                            My favorite name for him is ""Dubya,"" but everyone calls                            him ""Mr. President."" I just call him my best pal.

GX043-72-9836860	"Percentage of female lawmakers rising nationally  By Katherine Schott/ QUAD-CITY TIMES    SPRINGFIELD - Women have been steadily boosting their numbers in state Legislatures across the country. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University reported that only 301 women were serving as state lawmakers in 1969. By 2002, 1,681 of the nation's 7,424 state lawmakers were female.    Washington state has the most female state lawmakers, with 57 out of 147 seats in their Legislature occupied by women. On the other end of the spectrum, only 11 out of 140 state legislators in Alabama are female.    Illinois falls 16th. In 1975, 14 out of 236 lawmakers were female: by 2002, 47 out of 177 lawmakers are women. The 12 female senators make up 20 percent of that chamber, while the 35 representatives make up about 30 percent of the House. The most recent U.S. Census figures reflect that 51 percent of Illinois' population is female.    But the majority of those females are from the Chicago region. Of the 47 female state lawmakers, 40 come from Cook County or the so-called collar counties surrounding Cook.    ""You're trying to break into an environment that is dominated by men,"" State Rep. Julie A. Curry, D-Mount Zion said. ""We are in the minority. I think any woman running for any office has to work harder to prove (she) can do the job.""    Curry was 28 when she assumed her first public office, Macon County treasurer. She joined a government dominated by males, who she said were not thrilled when she began making changes after discovering her predecessor had embezzled nearly $500,000.    ""Even though they were good men, it was rocking the boat,"" Curry said. ""When I started to change things, people said, 'Hey, that's not how things were done in the past.'""    Steve Brown, spokesman for House Speaker Michael J. Madigan, D-Chicago, said he is unsure why more women aren't elected from downstate Illinois. He said the women who do make it to Springfield are being seen and heard, pointing to House Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago, as an example.    Currie believes her gender had something to do with Madigan's selection of her, because a female leader brought diversity to the Democratic ranks. She said her 23 years serving as a state representative helped too. ""I certainly paid my dues.""    Brown agreed.    ""I'm not sure that Barbara Currie is there because she is a woman,"" he said. ""She has an outstanding intellectual handle on governmental issues. She offers good, sound advice."""

Typically her day              consists of a morning of ‚Äúfree‚Äù time where she seeks dog              lovers with biscuits, visits the physical/occupational therapy room              or makes friends with staff in the facility.             In the afternoon, her owner, Activity Director Shelly              Marabella, guides her room-to-room visiting each resident. On occasion              other greyhounds Calvin, Girlie & Mary join Emily for afternoon              visits.              Visits encompass a range of discussions from reminiscing              about their own pets to curiosity regarding              the greyhound breed and treatment of the dogs on the track. These              seemingly simple discussions promote not only recall of the residents‚Äô              past, but prompt              discussion of issues related to their disease process.             The dogs promote a safe avenue to developing a trusting              relationship with staff and volunteers. The calming effects extend              way past the visit. Petting the dogs has been proven to decrease blood              pressure and has a calming effect in the short term. All in all, the              dogs have provided an element of ‚Äúhome‚Äù vs. the sterile              environment of the hospitals where many residents previously lived.              The residents enjoy and look forward to the weekly visits.

GX007-02-12414179	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      CR WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 14, 1996    (202) 616-2777        TDD (202) 514-1888   TWO KLANSMEN PLEAD GUILTY TO BURNING TWO SOUTH CAROLINA CHURCHES   WASHINGTON, D.C. --  Two former members of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan pleaded guilty today to burning two predominantly African American churches in South Carolina last year.  The investigation is being conducted by the National Church Arson Task Force formalized by President Clinton in June.   Gary Christopher Cox, 23, and Timothy Adron Welch, 24, who were charged today in a criminal Information with two civil rights conspiracies and two federal arson charges, admitted to burning the Mt. Zion AME Church in Greeleyville on June 20, 1995, and the Macedonia Baptist Church in Bloomville on the following day.   ""Today's pleas once again underscore the seriousness with which the federal government is pursuing the burning of houses of worship,"" said Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and James E. Johnson, Assistant Secretary of the  Treasury (Enforcement), the co-chairs of the National Church Arson Task Force.  ""These arsons are an assault on a basic tenet of American democracy -- religious freedom.""   Judge David C. Norton, of the U.S. District Court in Charleston, accepted the guilty pleas.   According to the criminal Information, the Ku Klux Klan ""advocated the supremacy of white persons over black, hispanic and other minority persons.""  It asserted that the K.K.K. ""taught its members that churches attended primarily by black persons promote the interests of black persons to the detriment of white persons.""   Cox and Welch had been charged in federal court in May with burning the Greeleyville church.  In a criminal complaint, unsealed last month, the Justice Department alleged that the two violated a federal criminal arson statute in setting the blaze at Mt. Zion AME Church.   Cox and Welch, who face up to 55 years in prison, were arrested on state charges in June 1995, and have been in jail since that time.  The two have agreed to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the ongoing investigation into the burning of the two churches.   ""They can scorch our churches but they cannot break the spirit of the community,"" said J. Rene Josey, U.S. Attorney in Columbia.   As part of the plea agreement, the two Klansmen also agreed to plead guilty to state charges of assault and battery with intent to kill for stabbing a black man in Berkeley County on June 16, 1995.   Since June 1, 1996, more than 90 church fires across the country have been reported to federal authorities.  Arrests have been made in connection with at least 16 of these incidents, while another 16 fires have been ruled accidental.   The investigation includes the U.S. Attorneys Office in South Carolina, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the Clarendon County Fire Department and Sheriff's Office.   # # #   96-385"

As I searched                            the house looking for tennis balls and bones, I was                            surprised at how familiar the place smelled. It was                            as if I had been there before.                           I                            nudged my owner, President Bush, on the ankle and he                            said to me, ""Well, Spotty, how does it feel to be living                            again in the same house where you were born?""                                                      Then it all made dog sense. This big house is the White House, the place where I was born on March 17, 1989. My mother, Millie, took care of me and my brothers and sisters before President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush took me to their house in Texas.                                                      Today,                            my owner lives in this house, and he has a new name.                            My favorite name for him is ""Dubya,"" but everyone calls                            him ""Mr. President."" I just call him my best pal.

GX252-11-7532969	"National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month ""Strengthening the Spirit"" November 2003  Department of Commerce Heritage Ceremony Washington, D.C.  ""Heritage and Health: Sovereign Nations and the Federal Health Program"" by  Charles W. Grim, D.D.S., M.H.S.A. Assistant Surgeon General Director, Indian Health Service November13, 2003 Good morning, I appreciate the invitation to speak to you today, during National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month, about the Indian Health Service  the Federal health program for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The month of November is designated as a time to recognize and honor the contributions of American Indians and Alaska Natives to the unique culture and greatness of America. It is also an opportunity to share information with others about the special relationship between the Federal Government and the more than 560 Sovereign Nations within the United States. American Indians and Alaska Natives enjoy the rights and benefits of every American citizen, since the Indian Citizenship Act was passed in 1924 granting U.S. citizenship to this country's original inhabitants, and, unlike other American citizens, they also have treaty rights. American Indian and Alaska Native rights were formalized by the initial treaties of 1784, in which the federal government acknowledged certain responsibilities toward the indigenous people. The government's obligations were subsequently reconfirmed and defined by Supreme Court decisions, legislation, Executive Orders, and other federal policies. The relationship between tribal governments and the federal government is founded in the U.S. Constitution, which recognizes that federally recognized Indian Tribes are sovereign nations with inherent rights. This distinguishes American Indians and Alaska Natives from all other ethnic groups in the United States. Just as there is a federal health program for members of the armed forces, for our country's veterans, and for our prisoners  there is the Indian Health Service, which is the primary agency for carrying out the federal government's treaty obligations to Indian Tribes to provide health services: Health services that were guaranteed by treaties entered into between the Federal Government and Sovereign Nations in exchange for land, mineral rights, resources and, during certain periods of American history, some personal rights and freedoms. The text is the basis of Dr. Grim's oral remarks at the Commerce Department Ceremony for National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month on November 13, 2003. It should be used with the understanding that some material may have been added or omitted during presentation. Page 1 of 5   There are two federal agencies carrying out the trust responsibilities of the Federal Government for tribal governments and American Indian and Alaska Native people  the Indian Health Service (for health services) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (for all other federal program services). After my presentation today, if you remember nothing else, you will know that the Indian Health Service is within the Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Indian Affairs is within the Department of the Interior. The Indian Health Service was once part of the Department of Interior, but has not been there since 1955. Looking out at this audience  hardly any of you look like you were born before 1955, so in your lifetime the Indian Health Service has never been part of the Interior Department or the BIA  yet that perception continues to this day. The location of the Indian Health Service seems to be an urban myth that continues despite facts to the contrary. At least I know that the myth will no longer have a foothold in the Department of Commerce! The Indian Health Service was transferred in 1955 to the Department of Health and Human Services, then known as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and became an independent agency of the Department in 1988. The Indian health care system is composed of health care services directly administered by the Indian Health Service, those administered by Tribes under the authority of the Indian SelfDetermination and Education Assistance Act, and those administered by urban Indian health programs. Services provided by the IHS and Tribes are administered through a decentralized system of 12 Area Offices and 155 service units, 60 of which are managed by the IHS, and 95 are tribally managed. The Indian health system consists of 49 hospitals, 236 health centers, 176 Alaska village clinics, 133 health stations, and 33 residential treatment centers. Overall, approximately 48% of the IHS appropriation is retained to provide direct services to Tribes and the remaining 52% is transferred to Tribes to operate the programs and facilities they have contracted from the IHS to provide for their members. In addition, there are 34 urban Indian health projects, which receive some funding from the Indian Health Service, that provide some medical, dental, and other individual health care services while some projects provide only outreach and referral. Of the Indian health system, the IHS professional staff includes approximately 900 physicians, 2,600 nurses, 300 dentists, and 430 pharmacists with annual vacancy rates from 8 to 23 percent depending on the discipline. Of the approximately 15,000 IHS employees, 69 percent are American Indian or Alaska  Native. Excluding medical and engineering professionals, 88 percent of the IHS employees are Indian. Primary care and community health services are the main focus of our care system; a few of the hospitals provide secondary care with specialists  such as surgeons and obstetricians, but the majority of our services are provided by generalists such as family physicians, pediatricians, general practice dentists, physician assistants, and others. Much of the specialty care, both inpatient and outpatient, is purchased from private or other public sector providers. The 2000 census identified number of American Indian and Alaska Native people in the U.S. is approximately 2.6 million. The Indian health system serves those who are members of the more than 560 federally recognized Tribes in 35 States, which includes approximately 1.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives residing on or near reservations. Annually, the IHS provides approximately 11.5 million health services. In addition, approximately 330,000 Indian people are served in urban Indian health clinics So, the Indian health system serves approximately 62 percent of the total Indian population in the United States. Our annual appropriation is approximately $3 billion and we collect an additional $500 million from third-party payers like Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. This results in approximately a per-capita amount of roughly $1,900 per person that the agency spends on those eligible for IHS services. The Medicare expenditure per enrollee is approximately $6,000; for Veterans, $5,200; for prisoners $3,800. Federal Employees receive approximately $3800 in medical care through the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. Again, those eligible for IHS services receive roughly $1,900. In order to help fill this funding gap, the IHS and Tribes must depend more and more on partnerships with foundations, academic medical centers, and other state and federal health programs as we try to meet the health needs of our families and communities. We also advocate and encourage programs that affect the lives of rural and reservation communities to focus on those populations as well. An example of this is the awarding of economic grants by the Department of Commerce (through its Economic Development Administration) to 65 Indian Tribes to help those communities build the capacity to focus on long-term economic challenges. By helping to strengthen the economic infrastructure of Tribes, these grants also contribute to related factors, such as improvements in socioeconomic status, that impact heavily on health and wellness in the community. Study after study confirms those connections. The higher someone's education level, the  The text is the basis of Dr. Grim's oral remarks at the Commerce Department Ceremony for National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month on November 13, 2003.

The higher someone's health status, the greater their potential for educational achievement and success. Higher education level results in increased earning power. Greater income results in higher health status. Improving the economic infrastructure of Indian communities is critical to improving the health status of that community. Eliminating health disparities also means that we must make a commitment to eliminate all disparities  such as disparities in housing, education, employment opportunities, business investments, political influence, and economic development. As you can see, the federal health program for American Indians and Alaska Natives is a comprehensive and complex program striving with its partners to meet the health needs of a steadily increasing and aging population. But health disparities between American Indians and Alaska Natives are still significant. Since the 1955 transfer of the Indian Health Service into the Department of Health and Human Services, there have been significant health challenges that have been overcome. Mortality rates have decreased in almost all categories, including maternal deaths, gastrointestinal disease, tuberculosis, infant deaths, unintentional injuries, pneumonia, influenza, homicide, alcoholism, and suicide. And the lifespan of Alaska Natives and American Indians has increased from 51 years in 1940 to 71 years today, but that is still 6 years below the average life span of other Americans. And over this timeframe, our illness and disease challenges have transitioned away from infectious disease control to challenges of chronic disease and the consequences of behavioral and lifestyle choices. Even with significant improvements in health status, Indian people continue to experience health disparities and death rates that are higher than the rest of the nation:  Alcoholism - 770% higher  Diabetes - 420% higher  Accidents - 280% higher  Suicide - 190% higher  Homicide - 210% higher And all of these are influenced by lifestyle and behavioral-related choices. The latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that among the top 10 leading causes of death for all Americans are heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and diabetes  all of them can likely be traced back to a lifestyle or behavioral influence. For American Indians and Alaska Natives that list of five is the same with the additional causes of suicide and, because of high rates of hepatitis A and C in our  communities, liver-disease. Like the rest of America, the greatest factor for improving health status is to focus on making health-positive lifestyle and behavioral choices. Behavior choices result in 50% of the disease burden in this country. Genetic factors account for 20% and environmental conditions account for another 20%. Access to care accounts for only 10% of the country's disease burden. While lifestyle and behavioral-related choices can be cited as a contributing cause of illness and disease  lifestyle and behavioral-related choices can also be cited as a contributing factor in eliminating or delaying an illness or disease. The history of Indian health begins much earlier. The story of American Indian and Alaska Native people bears little resemblance to what we read about in most history books and what we see romanticized or villainized on the movie screen. The history, as told by Indian people and other reliable scholars, is still emerging. It wasn't until after World War II that an appreciation of the multi-cultural nature of America began to emerge. The Americas were originally settled by Indian people more than 10,000 years ago. During the course of their history, as tribal groups scattered thinly across the continental expanse, they established diverse sophisticated social structures with unique languages, religious practices, intricate customs and distinct identities. American Indian and Alaska Native people share a complex, sometimes turbulent history with the European settlers and other immigrants. Some Indian Tribes and cultures have managed to endure through centuries while many Tribes and traditional cultures did not survive. Many rich cultural treasures, including over 150 unique native languages, are lost forever. This vanished history and heritage is a tragic national loss. During the late 1700s, European immigrants brought small pox, plague, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases to this continent. American Indians and Alaska Natives did not have immunity from foreign contagions, and American Indians were particularly vulnerable to these maladies. Thus, illness spread rapidly through Indian communities and decimated many tribal groups. When the Europeans arrived on this continent there were approximately 10 million native people. By 1890 the Indian population had decreased to 250,000. During this same time period the population of Europeans went from zero to 75 million. And today the U.S. population is around 293 million and the tribally recognized Indian population is around 2.6 million.  The text is the basis of Dr. Grim's oral remarks at the Commerce Department Ceremony for National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month on November 13, 2003. It should be used with the understanding that some material may have been added or omitted during presentation. Page 3 of 5   By the early 1800s, scores of Indian people living near Army posts succumbed to infectious diseases, which then threatened the health of military personnel and other army post workers. To curtail the spread of disease among its own, the Army physicians began providing medical treatment to Indians with contagious diseases living nearby. This marked the initial provision of health care by the U.S. Government to American Indians. Improvements in the health of Indian people were made after physician services were formally established in 1849; the first nurse joined the medical staff in the 1890s; and field matrons (later Public Health Service nurses) began their health education efforts in 1891. Eventually, in 1922 the government formalized this arrangement with the passage of the Snyder Act, agreeing to provide medical treatment to federally recognized Indians and their descendants for ""the relief of distress and conservation of health."" Efforts to improve the health of Indian people in the mid- and late-1800's were contrasted with other public policies designed to eliminate Indian people and their culture. As a result, many Tribes and families were lost. Later still, when it was believed that the best way to help Indian people become part of the dominant society and enjoy its benefits, assimilation programs were imposed on them. The Indian boarding school program was one such assimilation experiment, which included not allowing Indian children to speak their native language, acknowledge their tribal culture, or to honor their heritage. I am sure this forced exclusion of their culture contributed to the deaths of many Indian children while attending the boarding schools because they were physically, and spiritually, unable to recover from illness and disease as a result of an impoverished way of life, isolation, and discrimination. For more than 120 years, the responsibility for Indian health care was transferred among different Federal Government branches. Finally, in 1955, it settled permanently within the Department of Health and Human Services. The influence of the great spirit of American Indians and Alaska Natives on the culture of America has been profound. Indian art, language, philosophy, and spirituality are woven into the fabric of our nation. America's political system also owes a debt to early American Indian and Alaska Native influence. The Great Peace Law, which made it possible for the confederation of five Iroquois nations to function in harmony for several centuries, was used by colonists as a model for the United States constitution . . . and a model for democracy.  During this week and the celebration of Veterans Day last Tuesday, I am reminded that our country's freedom has been won and defended by Americans from diverse backgrounds and cultures  but they serve and served for the same reason; to protect the rights and benefits that come with freedom and defend the principles of democracy. There was a time when many American Indians and Alaska Natives were not able to serve in the military services  because their health was so poor they could not pass the physical requirements. That was as recent as 1955, at the time when the Indian Health Service was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Now they serve in proportionally greater numbers than any other population group in the U.S. In fact, they have a long history of military service to this great nation. American Indians and Alaska Natives have participated with distinction in every war this country has ever known. Indian soldiers served as auxiliary troops in the Civil War and were active in the American West in the late 1800s and early 1900s, accompanying Gen. John J. Pershing's troops on expeditions. American Indians were also recruited by Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and saw action in Cuba in the Spanish-American War in 1898. More than 12,000 American Indians served in the United States military in World War I. In World War II, more than 44,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives, out of a total population of less than 350,000, served with honor. The now famous Indian code talkers helped win historic battles of World War I and II, transmitting messages in their native languages. The code talkers of World War I came from the Tribes of the Cheyenne, Comanche, Cherokee, Choctaw, Osage, and Yankton Sioux. The code talkers of World War II came from the Tribes of the Chippewa, Choctaw, Comanche, Creek, Hopi, Kiowa, Menominee, Muscogee-Seminole, Oneida, Pawnee, Sac & Foc, Sioux, Winnebago, and Navajo. The now famous Navajo Indian code talkers earned their historic reputation by taking part in every assault the U.S. Marines conducted in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, transmitting messages in their native language -- a code that the Japanese never broke. Battles like Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu, and Iwo Jima  the code talkers were there and never made a mistake in transmission. During the two World Wars, American Indian and Alaska Native men and women on the home front also served their country with pride. More than 40,000 Indian people left their reservations to work in ordnance depots, factories, and other war industries. American Indians and Alaska Natives also invested more than $50  The text is the basis of Dr. Grim's oral remarks at the Commerce Department Ceremony for National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month on November 13, 2003.

Indian troops also fought during the Korean conflict, and approximately 42,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives, more than 90 percent of them volunteers, fought in Vietnam. In the 1980s and 1990s, they saw duty in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, and the Persian Gulf. And it continues today, as American Indian and Alaska Native soldiers serve in Afghanistan and Iraq, alongside their brother and sister soldiers. Soldiers like Jessica Lynch from West Virginia, Shoshana Johnson from Texas, Patrick Miller from Kansas, and Lori Piestewa from the Hopi Tribe in Arizona, who is the first American Indian woman killed in combat, whose spirit endures through her children and family, and in America's memory. The great spirit of American Indian and Alaska Native people has endured, and with all our help, will continue to endure and to strengthen  and, in turn, will continue to help define the American spirit.

GX028-52-10337540	Rachel Vanderheyden Stringer     by   Stefan Bielinski          Rachel Vanderheyden Stringer  was the wife of early Albany's foremost physician. Rachel was born in July 1740. She was the youngest child of David and Geertruy Visscher Vanderheyden. Her father was a prominent Albany businessman and civic leader.     She had just passed her eighteenth birthday in November 1758 when she married newcomer  Dr. Samuel Stringer . Although her husband was an Anglican, she was a member and pewholder at the Albany  Dutch church . Their marriage produced only one son and two daughters.    As a physician's wife, she came into daily contact with a large number of people who visited her home and Dr. Stringer's office in the third ward. By the 1780s, she was living in a large   double house  on Market Street which the Stringers shared with their daughter, the wife of attorney and New York State officier  Stephen Lush .      Rachel Vanderheyden Stringer died in 1797 and was buried from the Dutch church.                                 notes                       Sources:  The life of Rachel Vanderheyden Stringer is CAP  biography          number  5712.

Moore     Q.  W here [sic] were you employed at the time of the big flood at Johnstown?  A.  At the passenger depot as Assistant Ticket Agent.    Q.  How long had you been there?  A.  In the neighborhood of two years and a half; I can't just tell the exact time, but in that neighborhood.     Q.  What, if anything, do you know about a message  being received  from either Conemaugh or South Fork, or any point in reference to the condition of the South Fork dam?  A.  We received a message, as near  as I can tell, about 11.40, signed ""RP"" stating that the South Fork dam was in danger, and to notify people in Johnstown to prepare for the worst.      Q.  Who gave you/that [sic] message?  A.  I got it from Miss North, the operator.    Q.  What did you do after you got that message?  A.  I went up and down the platform and notified everybody on the platform that I had received such a message, and I handed it to two parties, John Reese and Wm. Stremmel, and let them read it, and they laughed at it, and said it was the same old story we have had for several years.  I told them ""Well, there's the message.""    Q.  To whom was it directed?  A.  Thomas H. Watt, the Ticket Agent.    Q.  Where was it from?  A.  It was signed by ""R.P."", and I think it was from ""OD"", Pitts,burgh [sic];  I wouldn't be positive.    Q.  Do you know whether that message was telephoned or sent over to the central office at Johnstown?  A.  It was sent to the Agent at Johnstown, and I didn't know whether Mr. Deckert had received such a message or not,and [sic] I went up and told about it, and he said he had just telephoned it over then.    Q.  What time was that?  A.  It was sometime between 11 and 12 o'clock; as near as I can recollect, about 11.40.    Q.  Had the Day Expresses passed or not?  A.  Yes, sir, they had gone up , and the Special with Mr. Trump had gone up.    Q.  You had no opportunity  of advising the conductors of either of those trains of that message?  A.  No, sir.  I went to work that morning as usual about eight o'clock.  I run the night trains, and Mr. Watt runs the morning trains, and the water was then up about his house three or four feet, and he remarked that he had a notion to go over and get his folks out and get them home, as his wife was not very stout; and I advised him to do so, as it would be damp about his place for some time.  So he went over, and he was over home getting his folks out, and he couldn't get back.  That's why I got the message instead of him.    Q.  Do you recollect who delivered that to you?  A.  I wouldn't be positive, but I think I got it from Miss North herself.  There was another message received about two o'clock; [sic]    Q.  Who received that message?  A.  I did.    Q.  Who was that from?  A.  I don't remember.    Q.  Do you know from what point?  A.  No, sir, I don't.    Q.  What was the substance of that message?  A.  The substance of that message was that the dam was very full and liable to break.    Q.  What did you do in reference to notifying the people about that?  A.  I couldn't do anything at all.    Q.  For what reason?  A.  Because there was no was to get over to notify the people; the water was too high; and it wouldn't have made any difference if we had notified them; they wouldn't have paid any attention to it.  There was one man, a Mr. Reese, who went to work and made a   raft, and got his wife and two little children out, and went back for his father and mother, and they refused to leave the property, and they staid there.  They said there was no danger.   And they were lost.    Q.  Where was your house that you lived in?  A.  Do you know where the Methodist Church is?Well, [sic] it is the only stone building there is left on the street;--on [sic] the corner of Clinton & ------- [sic] Locust Street.  My house was carried away, and I lost my wife.     Q.  Your wife was swept out by the flood, and drowned?  A.  Yes, sir; I never saw her after I went to work that morning.    Q.  Was her body recovered?  A.  Yes, sir.     By E. S. Hatchelor.    Q.  Didn't you receive a message from some other point with ""Please note"", or something or that kind on it?  A.  No, sir, I don't think I did.  I wouldn't be positive about that.  I think the message I received was direct from ""H.P."".    Q.  How did it read?  A.  As near  as I  can tell you, ""South Fork dam is liable to break; notify the people of Johnstown to prepare for  the worst"", and  w e [sic] took that as official notice to notify them, and that is what we tried to do.    Q.  That was the first or second message?  A.  That was the first.    Q.  And what was the other one?  A.  The other one was that the dam was overflowing, and was dangerous.    Q.  That was  about 3 o'clock?  A.  About 2.40.        Return to the List of Witnesses"

Each year         the ABMA presents a fundraising concert during an all-day         event called the ABMA Showcase of Alabama Bands. This         year the event will be held on March 6 th          beginning at 10 am at the Bessemer Civic Center off         Interstate 59 near the intersection of I459 and I59. The         cost is $5. All bands performing are members of the ABMA         and volunteer their time and talent to help out. This         year, 25 different bands from throughout Alabama are         slated to perform, including the Jake Landers Band,         Southern Comfort, Lickity Split, Red Perry & the         Coosa Valley Boys, and Cedar Creek. Those attending will         hear a sweeping variety of bluegrass and bluegrass gospel         music for your entertainment.           Modern bluegrass music         developed in the early 1950s as a separate musical genre         from ""Country and Western."" This happened when         Nashville's Country and Western sound became         progressively ""popular"" with the inclusion of         large orchestras, trap drum sets and full electrification         of the rhythm instruments. Bluegrass has kept closer to         its rural roots in old-time music, once pejoratively         termed ""hillbilly"" music. The         ""hillbilly"" genre probably was born in the         1920s and was featured on recordings and radio programs         of the era, especially the Grand Ol' Opry on Nashville's         radio station WSM.            Most instruments used in         modern bluegrass bands are nearly the same as earlier         ""old-time music."" Instrumentation is primarily         acoustic and rarely electrified except, sometimes, the         bass. The standard bluegrass instrumentation is fiddle,         guitar, banjo, mandolin, standup bass and dobro slide         guitar.            Bluegrass has, primarily,         a secular repertory interlaced with gospel songs. In         addition, there is often humorous banter between the         songs. The repertory is consistent with early Grand Ol'         Opry programming as well as earlier minstrel and medicine         shows that injected humor into the performance. Certain         songs used in bluegrass music have a link to traditional         folk ballads and fiddle tunes. At any bluegrass gathering         one may hear fiddle tunes such as, ""Whoa Mule,""         ""A Soldier's Joy,"" ""Billy in the Low         Ground,"" ""Sally Gooden,"" ""Faded         Love,"" ""Chicken Cackle,"" or other tunes         related to Old-World Scots-Irish or British music.           It is believed that         mandolin player Bill Monroe coined the term         ""bluegrass"" describing it as a combination of         blues and hoe-down music. Also a factor in the naming         could have been that Monroe was born in the Bluegrass         State of Kentucky. In the 1920-30's Bill Monroe and his         brother Charlie were the prototype of the bluegrass band         of today.           Bluegrass music in Alabama         has a grass roots orientation. Most performing bands are         usually locally known and most performers do not derive a         major part of their income from playing in a band. For         most performers, it is playing and singing music they         love for others that makes it all worthwhile. There is a         real camaraderie between bluegrass aficionados. Local         bluegrass parks, where festivals and concerts are held,         are found throughout Alabama.            Nearly every little park         offers amenities for recreational vehicles to hook up to         water and electricity for a fee during the time of the         event. A few of these parks are Horsepens 40 near         Gadsden, Flatwoods Music Park in Lowndes County, and the         Dixie Bluegrass Music Park in Coffee County. One often         has to get a camper spot a day or so ahead because of         limited space. Besides music parks specifically for         bluegrass events, there are also annual bluegrass events         held in various locales each year, such as the Dixie         Bluegrass Festival held at the city park in Holly Pond         and the annual ABMA concert. Much of the fun at these         events are the informal picking sessions under the canopy         of a recreational vehicle or in the shade of nearby oak.         For campers spending the night, potluck suppers or other         social events fill the time until the stage         presentations. Bluegrass events offer quality family fun         and are gaining in popularity through a network of         regional events each year.

To the right is the Cambria Iron Works, and to the          left is the Millville school house, afterwards used as a morgue.""          American and Foreign Scenery published by Robert K. Bonine of Tyrone,          PA          One of the most devastating tragedies ever to afflict Pennsylvania was          the ""Great Johnstown Flood"" that occurred on May 31, 1889. The          amount of property destroyed and the number of lives lost were unprecedented.         Pennsylvania is especially susceptible to floods. The state is on several          ""major west-east storm tracks."" Its average of forty-two inches          of rainfall annually is deceiving, for at times large amounts of rain          fall in single storms. Some of the precipitation comes in the form of          snow, large quantities of which melt suddenly either when the average          January temperature of twenty-nine degrees rises suddenly during a warm          spell or in the spring thaw. The state's major rivers and many of its          streams have shallow beds that flow through flat land, which restricts          the amount of water that they can hold. Before the European settlers arrived,          trees covered 95% of the state, preventing heavy run off during storms.          Large scale lumbering during the 1800s removed this barrier along many          waterways. As a result, serious floods that caused significant loss of          life and property damage have occurred throughout the state, including          Johnstown, during the past two centuries.         Several of these conditions contributed to the ""Great Johnstown          Flood of 1889."" The town had grown rapidly- from 1,269 in 1850 to          nearly 30,000 in 1889. It had thirty-six churches, twenty schools, a library,          two opera houses, a roller skating rink, and a park. Many of the town's          buildings were constructed with wood. Local lumbermen and operators of          saw mills laid bare the original forests on the surrounding hillsides.          Stony Creek, the Little Connemaugh River, and the Connemaugh River that          flowed through the town became narrower for different reasons. Personal          and industrial waste was deposited in them and officials of the Pennsylvania          Railroad and the Cambria Iron Company who wanted more space for their          operations filled parts of them.         Nevertheless, the ""Great Johnstown Flood"" differed from others          there and elsewhere in that on May 31, 1889, twenty million tons of water          that formed a wall thirty-six feet high traveled fourteen miles going          approximately forty miles per hour struck the town. The water came from          Lake Connemaugh, 450 feet above Johnstown, when the earthen dam that had          held it gave way. Known initially as the Western Reservoir or the South          Fork Dam, its original purpose was to provide water for the Pennsylvania          Canal, which was part of the state transportation system that carried          passengers and freight between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Completed          in 1852, it was thought to be the largest dam of its type forming the          most extensive reservoir in the United States. The dam was seventy-two          feet high, 931 feet long and formed a lake over sixty feet deep that covered          an area two miles long.         After 1854, when the Pennsylvania Railroad built the Horseshoe Curve,          facilitating continuous rail service across the state, traffic on the          canal declined, and the reservoir was no longer necessary. By 1880, it          had become the property of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Among          its sixty or so members were such nationally prominent industrialists,          bankers, and attorneys as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W.          Mellon, and Philander Knox. They built ""cottages,"" stables,          and boat houses; partied in the clubhouse; fished and held regattas on          the lake; hunted on the grounds; and neglected to maintain the dam. The          discharge pipes had been removed, and screens were placed across the spillway          to keep the fish from escaping. This meant that it would be difficult,          if not impossible, to control the lake's level. The center of the dam          sagged because of inadequate repairs after a previous break. Warnings          from a few perceptive individuals fell on indifferent ears of the club's          officials. As for the vast majority of Johnstown's residents, the heavy          rains of May 1889, the storms of the month's last few days, and the rising          water in the streets, seemed not to alarm them. They had experienced previous          floods that had spawned rumors that the dam would break. Little did they          know what awaited them on the afternoon of May 31.         At 3:15, the dam gave way, releasing the huge amount of water that raged          downstream as if Niagara Falls had collapsed. Within a half to three-quarters          of an hour, the entire lake emptied. The wall of water that seemed more          like a ""rolling ball"" struck first the towns of South Fork,          Mineral Point, East Connemaugh, and Woodvale, wiping out most of them.          It hit Johnstown at 4:07, destroying four square miles of the city in          about ten minutes. Approximately 1600 homes and 280 businesses, including          much of the Cambria Iron Company, were leveled. Railroad cars and even          locomotives were lifted, over-turned, and carried by the water; their          tracks uprooted and twisted. The value of the property damaged or destroyed          was placed at $17 million, or more than $300 million today.         More tragic was the loss of life. Over 2,000 people were killed and 900          were listed as missing; ""99 entire families were lost""; and          nearly 400 children under ten were killed. Many victims drowned when their          homes were swept away. Others were burned to death when they were thrust          into the debris that was held by the stone bridge at the juncture of the          Stony Creek and the Little Connemaugh River, and the tangled mass caught          fire.         By the next morning, Saturday, June 1, the waters had gone down, and          the clean- up began. An outbreak of typhoid fever hindered the recovery          and added forty more to the death toll. Rescue workers placed sick and          injured survivors in emergency hospitals. The dead who could be found          were placed in morgues where relatives and friends tried to identify them.          One out of three bodies never were identified. Some corpses simply floated          away, and were located months later in distant locations, one as far away          as Cincinnati. Others that could not be found were listed among the missing.          The stereoview presented here depicts not only the devastation to the          city in the background, but the anguish and despair of its citizenry as          well.          News of the disaster spread rapidly, appearing in some newspapers on          Saturday morning. By mid-day, help began to arrive. Nearby farmers brought          food and clothing. On Sunday, a ""relief train"" from Pittsburgh          brought more of the same, as well as a boxcar of coffins. During the following          days and weeks, supplies continued to arrive. Inmates of the Western Penitentiary          provided 1,000 loaves of bread. Cincinnati's residents sent 20,000 pounds          of ham. Residents of Detroit sent twenty-five dozen chairs. The people          of Savanna shipped groceries, fish, cigars, disinfectants, whiskey, and          other useful items. Contributions of provisions amounted to over 1,400          carloads that weighed seventeen million pounds. Financial contributions          amounting to almost $4 million arrived from Pittsburgh businessmen, some          of whom belonged to the South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club; New York          policemen; a Baptist Church in Georgia; baseball players in Sedalia, Missouri;          the Sultan of Turkey; and others. England's Queen Victoria sent her condolences          to President Benjamin Harrison. Carnegie promised a new library. In addition,          volunteers, including 1,000 workmen from Pittsburgh, police officers,          and doctors arrived to assist in the relief and recovery. Clara Barton          brought her workers to provide homes and infirmaries called ""Red          Cross Hotels"" for the destitute, the first of which was completed          on July 27. At first, prominent residents of Johnstown coordinated the          efforts; however, state officials ordered Adjutant General Daniel Hastings          and 500 national guard troops to control the city from June 8 to July          12, an assignment that helped to propel Hastings to Pennsylvania's governorship          in 1895. The Western Union Telegram shown here is typical of many sent          to him from concerned family members anxious for news of loved ones during          the days following the flood. During the next few years, the survivors          rebuilt their shattered lives and city.         In the aftermath of the ""Great Johnstown Flood,"" emerged the          question of responsibility for the disaster. According to a Pittsburgh          newspaper, some clergy and others claimed that God had vented His wrath          upon the city's sinful people, most of whom had to work ten or twelve          hours a day, six or seven days a week, and had little time for sinning.          Others more reasonably blamed human failures. For example, a few people          observed that the banks of narrow mountain streams were not safe locations          for towns. Floods there were inevitable and frequent. The consensus, however,          was that the officials of the South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club were          responsible because of their failure to keep the South Fork Dam in a safe          condition. Hastings charged them with ""criminal negligence.""          The headline of a Chicago newspaper editorial on the flood was entitled          ""Manslaughter or Murder?"" It is certain that if the club's dam          had not given way, the heavy rains would have caused just another incident          of water in the city's streets; the tragedy would not have occurred. Despite          public accusations, conclusions of coroners, juries, and numerous lawsuits,          the club never was forced to take the blame, nor did it voluntarily accept          responsibility. Only a few of its members assisted the victims of the          flood that its officials had created by their irresponsibility.

For one week, the whole                      city is Scottish with dancing, games, and authentic Scottish                      food. The town was chartered in 1898, and took its name from                      the original Gaelic designation for Edinburgh. Early in Dunedin's                      history, Dunedin became one of the state's chief seaport and                      trading centers, and, at one time, it had the largest fleet                      of sailing vessels in Florida.                      Many                      Scottish settlers in America brought their traditions and                      lore with them. Soon Highland Games were being staged all                      over the United States. Dunedin joined the ranks of this prestigious                      group in 1966. Today the festival has grown to include the                      Florida Open Dance Championship, the Hiram Walker Florida                      Pipe Band Championship, and the U.S. National Masters Athletic                      Competition attracting athletes from all over the United States.                                           The                      Dunedin festival feature competitions in piping, dancing,                      drumming, and in ""tests of strength"" games, which include                      caber tossing, weight throwing, hammer throwing, and shot                      putting. Winners go on to compete at state, regional, national                      and international games. World championships are held in Scotland.                      A military tatoo, which includes several pipe bands from the                      local schools, is also part of the festivities, as well as                      Scottish storytelling and sheepdog demonstrations.

No, it's not an overweight ballplayer; it's someone who takes part in traditional Scottish games. The Highland Games in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, offer plenty of heavy athletes the opportunity to compete in events like tree-throwing. How would you like to throw a tree? By the time of the Revolutionary War, it was estimated that one out of every three people living in western Pennsylvania was of Scottish ancestry. Today, the people of Ligonier celebrate their Scottish heritage by holding the Ligonier Highland Games. The most popular games are called ""heavy athletics."" These games are a test of strength and skill for those who compete. Ancient Scottish leaders, chieftains, originally used Highland games to select the best men to go into battle. But in Ligonier the games are just for fun! Heavy athletes do things like throw big stones or even hammers to see who can throw the farthest. They also compete in a game called the caber toss.  Caber  is Gaelic (the traditional language of Scotland) for tree. The caber used in the Ligonier Highland Games is a tree trunk more than 14 feet long!                             page 1 of 1                           About Local Legacies ¬†¬†      ¬†¬†                                         Home    ¬†>¬†  Explore the States  ¬†>¬†  Pennsylvania  ¬†>¬†  Highland Games       Site Map"

(Courtesy Bureau of the Census)      Of the decennial population census schedules, perhaps none might have been more  critical to studies of immigration, industrialization, westward migration, and  characteristics of the general population than the Eleventh Census of the United  States, taken in June 1890. United States residents completed millions of detailed  questionnaires, yet only a fragment of the general population schedules and an  incomplete set of special schedules enumerating Union veterans and widows are  available today. Reference sources routinely dismiss the 1890 census records as  ""destroyed by fire"" in 1921. Examination of the records of the Bureau  of Census and other federal agencies, however, reveals a far more complex tale.  This is a genuine tragedy of records--played out before Congress fully established  a National Archives--and eternally anguishing to researchers.        As there was not a permanent Census Bureau until 1902, the Department of the Interior administered the Eleventh Census. Political patronage was ""the most common order for appointment"" of the nearly 47,000 enumerators; no examination was required. British journalist Robert Porter initially supervised the staff for the Eleventh Census, and statistician Carroll Wright later replaced him.(1) This was the first U.S. census to use Herman Hollerith's electrical tabulation system, a method by which data representing certain population characteristics were punched into cards and tabulated. The censuses of 1790 through 1880 required all or part of schedules to be filed in county clerks' offices. Ironically, this was not required in 1890, and the original (and presumably only) copies of the schedules were forwarded to Washington.(2)       June 1, 1890, was the official census date, and all responses were to reflect the status of the household on that date. The 1890 census law allowed enumerators to distribute schedules in advance and later gather them up (as was done in England), supposedly giving individuals adequate time to accurately provide information. Evidently this method was very little used. As in other censuses, if an individual was absent, the enumerator was authorized to obtain information from the person living nearest the family.(3)       The 1890 census schedules differed from previous ones in several ways. For the first time, enumerators prepared a separate schedule for each family. The schedule contained expanded inquiries relating to race (white, black, mulatto, quadroon, octoroon, Chinese, Japanese, or Indian), home ownership, ability to speak English, immigration, and naturalization. Enumerators asked married women for the number of children born and the number living at the time of the census to determine fecundity. The 1890 schedules also included a question relating to Civil War service.(4)       Enumerators generally completed their counting by July 1 of 1890, and the U.S. population was returned at nearly 63 million (62,979,766). Complaints about accuracy and undercounting poured into the census office, as did demands for recounts. The 1890 census seemed mired in fraud and political intrigue. New York State officials were accused of bolstering census numbers, and the intense business competition between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, resulted in no fewer than nineteen indictments against Minneapolis businessmen for allegedly adding more than 1,100 phony names to the census. Perhaps not surprisingly, the St. Paul businessmen brought the federal court complaint against the Minneapolis businessmen.(5)       In March 1896, before final publication of all general statistics volumes, the original 1890 special schedules for mortality, crime, pauperism and benevolence, special classes ( e.g.,  deaf, dumb, blind, insane), and portions of the transportation and insurance schedules were badly damaged by fire and destroyed by Department of the Interior order.(6) No damage to the general population schedules was reported at that time. In fact, a 1903 census clerk found them to be in ""fairly good condition.""(7) Despite repeated ongoing requests by the secretary of commerce and others for an archives building where all census schedules could be safely stored, by January 10, 1921, the schedules could be found piled in an orderly manner on closely placed pine shelves in an unlocked file room in the basement of the Commerce Building.        At about five o'clock on that afternoon, building fireman James Foster noticed smoke coming through openings around pipes that ran from the boiler room into the file room. Foster saw no fire but immediately reported the smoke to the desk watchman, who called the fire department.(8) Minutes later, on the fifth floor, a watchman noticed smoke in the men's bathroom, took the elevator to the basement, was forced back by the dense smoke, and went to the watchman's desk. By then, the fire department had arrived, the house alarm was pulled (reportedly at 5:30), and a dozen employees still working on upper floors evacuated. A total of three alarms and a general local call were turned in.(9)        After some setbacks from the intense smoke, firemen gained access to the basement.    While a crowd of ten thousand watched, they poured twenty streams of water into    the building and flooded the cellar through holes cut into the concrete floor.    The fire did not go above the basement, seemingly thanks to a fireproofed floor.    By 9:45 p.m. the fire was extinguished, but firemen poured water into the burned    area past 10:30 p.m. Disaster planning and recovery were almost unknown in 1921.    With the blaze extinguished, despite the obvious damage and need for immediate    salvage efforts, the chief clerk opened windows to let out the smoke, and except    for watchmen on patrol, everyone went home.(10)               Newspaper photographs captured the scene after the devastating fire and pointed out the need for safe storage of national records.       The morning after was an archivist's nightmare, with ankle-deep water covering  records in many areas. Although the basement vault was considered fireproof and  watertight, water seeped through a broken wired-glass panel in the door and under  the floor, damaging some earlier and later census schedules on the lower tiers.  The 1890 census, however, was stacked outside the vault and was, according to  one source, ""first in the path of the firemen.""(11) That morning, Census  Director Sam Rogers reported the extensive damage to the 1890 schedules, estimating  25 percent destroyed, with 50 percent of the remainder damaged by water, smoke,  and fire.(12) Salvage of the watersoaked and charred documents might be possible,  reported the bureau, but saving even a small part would take a month, and it would  take two to three years to copy off and save all the records damaged in the fire.  The preliminary assessment of Census Bureau Clerk T. J. Fitzgerald was far more  sobering. Fitzgerald told reporters that the priceless 1890 records were ""certain  to be absolutely ruined. There is no method of restoring the legibility of a water-soaked  volume.""(13)        Four days later, Sam Rogers complained they had not and would not be permitted any further work on the schedules until the insurance companies completed their examination. Rogers issued a state-by-state report of the number of volumes damaged by water in the basement vault, including volumes from the 1830, 1840, 1880, 1900, and 1910 censuses. The total number of damaged vault volumes numbered 8,919, of which 7,957 were from the 1910 census. Rogers estimated that 10 percent of these vault schedules would have to be ""opened and dried, and some of them recopied."" Thankfully, the census schedules of 1790-1820 and 1850-1870 were on the fifth floor of the Commerce Building and reportedly not damaged. The new 1920 census was housed in a temporary building at Sixth and B Streets, SW, except for some of the nonpopulation schedules being used on the fourth floor.(14)       Speculation and rumors about the cause of the blaze ran rampant. Some newspapers claimed, and many suspected, it was caused by a cigarette or a lighted match. Employees were keenly questioned about their smoking habits. Others believed the fire started among shavings in the carpenter shop or was the result of spontaneous combustion. At least one woman from Ohio felt certain the fire was part of a conspiracy to defraud her family of their rightful estate by destroying every vestige of evidence proving heirship.(15) Most seemed to agree that the fire could not have been burning long and had made quick and intense headway; shavings and debris in the carpenter shop, wooden shelving, and the paper records would have made for a fierce blaze. After all, a watchman and engineers had been in the basement as late as 4:35 and not detected any smoke.(16) Others, however, believed the fire had been burning for hours, considering its stubbornness. Although, once the firemen were finished, it was difficult to tell if one spot in the files had burned longer than any other, the fire's point of origin was determined to have been in the northeastern portion of the file room (also known as the storage room) under the stock and mail room.(17) Despite every investigative effort, Chief Census Clerk E. M. Libbey reported, no conclusion as to the cause was reached. He pointed to the strict rules against smoking, intactness of electrical wires, and noted that no rats had been found in the building for two months. He further reasoned that spontaneous combustion in bales of waste paper was unlikely, as they were burned on the outside and not totally consumed.(18) In the end, even experts from the Bureau of Standards brought in to investigate the blaze could not determine the cause.(19)       The disaster spurred renewed cries and support for a National Archives, notably from congressmen, census officials, and longtime archives advocate J. Franklin Jameson.(20) It also gave rise to proposals for better records protection in current storage spaces. Utah's Senator Reed Smoot, convinced a cigarette caused the fire, prepared a bill disallowing smoking in some government buildings. The  Washington Post  expressed outrage that the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were in danger even at the moment, being stored at the Department of State in wooden cabinets.(21)       Meanwhile, the still soggy, ""charred about the edges"" original and only copies of the 1890 schedules remained in ruins. At the end of January, the records damaged in the fire were moved for temporary storage. Over the next few months, rumors spread that salvage attempts would not be made and that Census Director Sam Rogers had recommended that Congress authorize destruction of the 1890 census. Prominent historians, attorneys, and genealogical organizations wrote to new Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the Librarian of Congress, and other government officials in protest. The National Genealogical Society (NGS) and Daughters of the American Revolution formally petitioned Hoover and Congress, and the editor of the  NGS Quarterly  warned that a nationwide movement would begin among state societies and the press if Congress seriously considered destruction.(22) The content of replies to the groups was invariably the same; denial of any planned destruction and calls for Congress to provide for an archives building. Herbert Hoover wrote ""the actual cost of providing a watchman and extra fire service [to protect records] probably amounts to more, if we take the government as a whole, than it would cost to put up a proper fire-proof archive building.""(23)       Still no appropriation for an archives was forthcoming. By May of 1921 the records were still piled in a large warehouse where, complained new census director William Steuart, they could not be consulted and would probably gradually deteriorate. Steuart arranged for their transfer back to the census building, to be bound where possible, but at least put in some order for reference.(24)        The extant record is scanty on storage and possible use of the 1890 schedules    between 1922 and 1932 and seemingly silent on what precipitated the following    chain of events. In December 1932, in accordance with federal records procedures    at the time, the Chief Clerk of the Bureau of Census sent the Librarian of Congress    a list of papers no longer necessary for current business and scheduled for    destruction. He asked the Librarian to report back to him any documents that    should be retained for their historical interest. Item 22 on the list for Bureau    of the Census read ""Schedules, Population . . . 1890, Original."" The    Librarian identified no records as permanent, the list was sent forward, and    Congress authorized destruction on February 21, 1933. At least one report states    the 1890 census papers were finally destroyed in 1935, and a small scribbled    note found in a Census Bureau file states ""remaining schedules destroyed    by Department of Commerce in 1934 (not approved by the Geographer).""(25)    Further study is necessary to determine, if possible, what happened to the fervent    and vigilant voices that championed these schedules in 1921. How were these    records overlooked by Library of Congress staff? Who in the Census Bureau determined    the schedules were useless, why, and when? Ironically, just one day before Congress    authorized destruction of the 1890 census papers, President Herbert Hoover laid    the cornerstone for the National Archives Building               Even after the outcry in 1921, thirteen years later the Census Bureau destroyed the remaining 1890 schedules.       In 1942 the National Archives accessioned a damaged bundle of surviving Illinois  schedules as part of a shipment of records found during a Census Bureau move.  At the time, they were believed to be the only surviving fragments.(26) In 1953,  however, the Archives accessioned an additional set of fragments. These sets of  extant fragments are from Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New  York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and the District of Columbia  and have been microfilmed as National Archives Microfilm Publication M407 (3 rolls).  A corresponding index is available as National Archives Microfilm Publication  M496 (2 rolls). Both microfilm series can be viewed at the National Archives,  the regional archives, and several other repositories. Before disregarding this  census, researchers should always verify that the schedules they seek did not  survive. There are no fewer than 6,160 names indexed on the surviving 1890 population  schedules. These are someone's ancestors.

GX010-46-11786513	"Colleagues, community honor Mark McLaughlin at memorial service       By Gary Larson, Senior Editor  Transportation Community Relations    Emotions ran deep and wide Tuesday as colleagues and the community mourned the death of slain Metro bus driver Mark McLaughlin, celebrated his life, and honored his professionalism and that of other transit operators.   ""As the bus moved along, I'd look out the window and see people with teary eyes,"" said Ryerson Base operator Harold Davis, one of perhaps thousands who rode in the 80-vehicle procession before the memorial service for Mark. ""Seeing people weeping was moving. Looking at people along the way, watching them watch us made tears bubble in my eyes, made my heart cry.   ""I had never known something like this to happen for a bus driver,"" said Davis, a 17-year transit operator now detailed to the Public Safety Partnership program. ""I had only seen it done for police officers and firefighters. It was an emotional event for me, to have the privilege to be a member of the procession.""   Besides Metro buses and vans, transit vehicles joined the procession from other Pacific Northwest transit agencies, including Grays Harbor, Island County, Kitsap County, Pierce Transit and Community Transit in Washington; Salem, Ore.; and Vancouver, B.C. Seattle firefighters stood by their fire engines in solemn salute to all transit operators as the procession passed by.   And at the memorial service in KeyArena, Davis' emotions ran the gamut, as they did for the estimated 5,000 members of the audience from Metro, other King County divisions, other transit agencies and the community Mark served.   ""The bagpipes were very moving to me, especially when they played 'Amazing Grace,'"" Davis said. ""I applied it to when I was going to church, where it was sung every time someone had passed on. I got flashbacks of that."" The Greater Seattle Pipe Band performed at both the beginning and end of the service.   ""Gunnar's musical tribute to Mark with the Jimi Hendrix song, 'Wind Cries Mary,' meant a lot,"" said Davis, a fellow musician. ""It's a somber song, very emotional, but Gunnar's humor changed the atmosphere and helped us rejoice.""    Former transit operator Gunnar Goerlitz, now working on Metro's SmartCard project, performed the song in recognition of Mark's long-time fan worship for the Seattle-born guitar virtuoso. And an employee group, Men Without Kilts & Lasses Fair, sang an old Welsh song, ""All Through the Night.""   ""I also liked Patty Murray's speech, the family theme she spoke of,"" Davis said. ""And I liked it when Mary Collins talked about the different tidbits that Mark had done  the bubble gum, the Halloween lips, candy canes at Christmas for kids -- as a giving, thoughtful-type of person.""    ""The entire community knows him now and is saddened by his loss,"" said U.S. Sen. Murray. ""Mark McLaughlin reminds each of us that we need to take time out in our lives to say, 'thank you.'""   Collins, who worked with Mark as his North Base chief, said she wanted to believe he was thinking of others, as he always did, even while trying to control the bus after the shooting  ""as a hero whose memory leaves me with a smile.""   County Executive Ron Sims implored the crowd to celebrate Mark's life: ""There should be no dirges or Requiems. This is a person who loved life!"" And the aroused audience followed Sims' dramatic lead when he coaxed them, ""I want you to give a shout for Mark McLaughlin so he can hear it from heaven.""   Other speakers included Transit General Manager Rick Walsh, who praised Mark's commitment to customer service, and Stan Green -- a fellow transit operator, basketball player and good friend -- who said, ""Mark did the best he could at a very tough job.""   In addition, County Council Chair Louise Miller read a signed proclamation paying homage to Mark. Barry Samet and Glen Travis, president and vice president of Local 587 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, guided the service their union sponsored and organized.    ""We are a family,"" Samet said. ""When we are on the job, we are truly brothers and sisters.""   And Mark's brother, Mike, gave humorous, touching insights into the sibling, son and father only he knows.   ""I didn't know Mark, but I have seen him around,"" said Harold Davis after the service, ""like when I went to North Base for union matters, or when I passed him on the street and we'd wave.""   But he was moved to tears again as the service ended, when the King County Sheriff's Honor Guard presented American flags to Mark's family  and again after the playing of ""Taps,"" when the Metro Control Center said loudly over the KeyArena public address system: ""Operator 2106  Operator 2106  Operator 2106 is now out of service.""

GX028-70-11085704	"Dr. Thomas Young     by   Stefan Bielinski          Dr. Thomas Young  (1732-99) of the Hudson Valley, New England, and Philadelphia, lived in Albany during the mid-1760s. In 1766, his was the first signature on the  constitution  of the Albany Sons of Liberty. He was the older brother of Albany physician  Dr. Joseph Young .     Thomas Young was born in New Windsor (then Ulster County) in February 1732. He was the oldest son of Scots-Irish immigrants John and Mary Crawford Young. The precocious child was apprenticed to a local physician and then began his own medical practice in Amenia, Dutchess County in 1753. Shortly thereafter, he married Mary P. Winegar of Connecticut. The marriage would produce two sons and four daughters. He was the Connecticut friend and mentor of Ethan Allen. He was a well-known Deist, a poet and writer, and liked to play the violin.    In 1760, he invested in a real estate venture in eastern New York promulgated by  John Henry Lydius . Frustrated by the failure of that project, in 1764 he published an essay supporting Lydius's attempt to disseminate land more widely. Later, in October, he removed to Albany to further pursue that initiative and and establish a new medical practice. While in Albany, his son Rasman was baptized at the  Lutheran Church .   Profoundly affected by the Stamp Act controversy, Young quit Albany and relocated to Boston in 1766. His ascent as a Revolutionary ideologue is well-documented in historical scholarship! In 1770, a correspondant of  Sir William Johnson  called him, ""formerly of Albany . . . now the great hero for liberty.""    Sick in Philadelphia, Dr. Thomas Young died on June 24, 1777. Following his death, his mother and widow removed to Albany to live with his  brother , a politically active physician himself!                 notes       Sources:  The life of Thomas Young is CAP  biography number  6972. This profile is derived chiefly from  family  and  community-based resources . The most interesting article on him is David Freeman Hawke, ""Dr. Thomas Young - Eternal Fisher in Troubled Waters: Notes for a Biography,""  New-York Historical Society Quarterly  64:1 (January 1970), pp.7-29, and the sources cited therin.

GX008-20-0246657	"McCullough     A Visit with Historian David McCullough                           Last year, David McCullough and NEH Chairman Bruce Cole talked about the humanities and the role they play in a democracy. This article is adapted from that conversation.      Bruce Cole : In many ways, you're the ideal historian because you bring first-rate scholarship to a wide audience in a way that is both literary and accessible.    David McCullough : Well, thank you. It's what I try very hard to do. My shorthand answer is that I try to write the kind of book that I would like to read. If I can make it clear and interesting and compelling to me, then I hope maybe it will be for the reader.     I just thank my father and mother, my lucky stars, that I had the advantage of an education in the humanities. Being an English major at Yale in the 1950s was a privilege.  People like John O'Hara, John Hersey, Brendan Gill, and Thornton Wilder were around on the campus. There were days when I sat down at the communal lunch table beside Thornton Wilder. There was the daily themes course, which was taught by Robert Penn Warren. Their presence was a reminder of how very far one had to go beyond Yale.     After Yale I served a valuable apprenticeship, first at  Time  and  Life , then at the U.S. Information Agency, then at  American Heritage , trying to learn how to do this. Once I discovered the endless fascination of doing the research and of doing the writing, I knew I had found what I wanted to do in my life.      Every book is a new journey. I never felt I was an expert on a subject as I embarked on a project. Mary Lee Settle, who is a writer whose work I greatly admire, said, ""I write to find out."" That says it perfectly.      With a book like  John Adams , I've spent six glorious years in the eighteenth century. To go into that time, it is necessary not to just read what they wrote--""they"" meaning John and Abigail Adams and others in their circle--but to try and read what they read. To go back and read Swift and Defoe and Samuel Johnson and Smollett and Pope--all those people we had to read in college English courses--to read them now is to have one of the infinite pleasures in life.     To me history ought to be a source of pleasure. It isn't just part of our civic responsibility. To me it's an enlargement of the experience of being alive, just the way literature or art or music is.  I have certain people that I try to keep in mind as an example.    Cole : Do you think about them while you're writing?    McCullough : Yes, very often. The more I go back and reread Francis Parkman, the more admiration I have for him. I paint, too, and--maybe it's true in all the arts--it's an antidote to hubris. You are reminded again and again of how far you have to go compared to what other people have done. You stand in front of one of those great paintings or you pick up Samuel Johnson's essays or Francis Parkman's works on the French and Indian War, and it's humbling. But it also is affirming in the sense that you realize that you're working in a great tradition.    Cole : Absolutely. Were I a painter standing in front of Rembrandt's  Late Self-portrait  in the Frick, I'd have given up. But it is inspiring. It does show you what can be done.    McCullough : The first time I saw Botticelli's  The Birth of Venus  in the Uffizi Gallery, it was as if I'd been struck. First of all, it was so much bigger than I ever had any idea it would be. And it's so glorious. It not only puts your own abilities in perspective, it certainly dashes any arrogance we might have about how far we've progressed over the centuries. Who in the world could do that today? Nobody. I would have flown all the way to Italy, taken the train up from Rome and back, and then home again, just to have seen that painting.     Cole : One of the things you never get from photographs is a sense of the physicality of the painting or of its scale.    When you teach art history you show slides. They are exactly the same size, and your students only have a vague approximation. When you actually see the thing it comes as a revelation.   To return for a moment to this question of history for a larger audience, aside from Parkman who are your heroes?    McCullough : There are certain books that I like very much.  Reveille in Washington . I love Barbara Tuchman's work, particularly  The Proud Tower . Paul Horgan's biography of Archbishop Lamy is a masterpiece. Wallace Stegner's book on John Wesley Powell I'm fond of.      I like some of the present-day people: Robert Caro's first volume on Lyndon Johnson was brilliant. I care for some of the best of the Civil War writing: Shelby Foote, for example, and Bruce Catton's  The Stillness at Appomattox .  It was Catton's  Stillness at Appomattox  that started me reading about the Civil War, and then on to people like Tuchman and others. There is a wonderful book called  The Reason Why , about the Charge of the Light Brigade--and biographies--Henri Troyat's  Tolstoy , for example.    I work very hard on the writing, writing and rewriting and trying to weed out the lumber. I'm very aware how many distractions the reader has in life today, how many good reasons there are to put the book down. To hold the reader's attention, you have to bring the person who's reading the book inside the experience of the time: What was it like to have been alive then? What were these people like as human beings?     When I did  Truman , I had no idea what woods I was venturing into. Had I known it was going to take me ten years, I never would have done it. In retrospect, I'm delighted now that I didn't know.     I love all sides of the work but that doesn't mean it isn't hard. There have been times when a book was taking year after year--not with this one so much, but with  The Path Between the Seas --when I'd come down to Washington to do research in the National Archives, hoping I wouldn't find anything new because it could set me back another year or two.     By the same token, to open up a box of the death certificates kept by the French at the hospital in Ancon, at Panama City and to read the personal details of those who died--their names, their age, where they came from, height, color of eyes--was a connection with the reality of them, the mortal tale of that undertaking, that one can never find by doing the conventional kind of research with microfilm or Xeroxed copies.    Cole : Do you find the research or the writing harder? I think writing is just an agony that we're all addicted to.    McCullough : To me it's very hard. There are days when you just can't get it right. But I love both. There's an awful temptation to just keep on researching. There comes a point where you just have to stop, and start writing. When I began, I thought that the way one should work was to do all the research and then write the book. In time I began to understand that it's when you start writing that you really find out what you don't know and need to know.    Cole : I feel that way myself. It's a clarifying process. It really shows you where you have to fill in the gaps.    McCullough : You can target your efforts much more clearly. I love to go to the places where things happen. I like to walk the walk and see how the light falls and what winter feels like.    Cole : Have you done this for every book?    McCullough : Every book, yes.     Cole :At what stage during your writing do you do that?     McCullough : I've done it two ways: With the  Truman  book, I wrote the entire account of his experiences in World War I before going over to Europe to follow his tracks in the war. When I got there, there was a certain satisfaction in finding I had it right--it does look like that. But there were also many things that were quite different from what I had pictured.     And I like to get a sense of scale--whether it's a battlefield or a room or a house. The house that the Adamses lived in in London--our first embassy there--still stands. It's the only eighteenth-century house left on Grosvenor Square, and it's tiny. I find that eloquent that it's so small.     It's like Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia. That's a beautiful little Georgian red brick structure, about fifty by fifty. It has all the ideals of the eighteenth century: balance and light. You go in there and you think: This is where the first Continental Congress met? One of the greatest beginnings in all of history began in this little room?     Cole : I was amazed about the populations of New York and Boston--how small they were and how big the British army was. That does help put it into perspective.    McCullough : When I read that the British army had landed thirty-two thousand troops--and I had realized, not very long before, that Philadelphia only had thirty thousand people in it--it practically lifted me out of my chair. They landed an army bigger than the entire population of the largest city in the country.    Cole : That's an amazing fact. It would be wonderful if there were more historians working in the way that you do. It seems to me that many academic historians are writing more and more for specialized audiences. It's always seemed to me that if you're passionate about something, you want to communicate that to the widest possible audience.     McCullough : I feel I'm working in a tradition that goes all the way back to Thucydides or Gibbon, if you want. They weren't academic historians either.    I can fairly be called an amateur because I do what I do, in the original sense of the word--for love, because I love it. On the other hand, I think that those of us who make our living writing history can also be called true professionals.    Cole : Absolutely.    McCullough : I don't feel that there is a great divide between the work that I and others do and those in the academic world. There are superb writers who are academic historians: Bernard Bailyn, William Leuchtenburg, Kenneth Jackson. And there are people who are trying to write history for the general reader who can be quite tedious. That said, I do feel in my heart of hearts that if history isn't well written, it isn't going to be read, and if it isn't read it's going to die.    Cole : I agree.    McCullough : I feel that what I do is a calling. I would pay to do what I do if I had to. I will never live long enough to do the work I want to do: the books I would like to write, the ideas I would like to explore. I have to have the form in mind before I can write the book.     Cole : You find the architecture. Then when you get into it, do you find all sorts of surprises?    McCullough : Absolutely. It's why everybody should be able to go into the stacks. You find the books you didn't know you were looking for.    Cole : One of my mentors said, ""Never use the card catalog. Get into the stacks and you'll make wonderful discoveries."" I took that advice, much to the chagrin of librarians.    McCullough : I could not do what I do without the kindness, consideration, resourcefulness and work of librarians, particularly in public libraries.     It happens all the time. I have librarians that will call up and say: ""You remember that thing you were looking for a year, two years ago, and we didn't know where it was? Well, we found it.""     What started me writing history happened because of some curiosity that I had about some photographs I'd seen in the Library of Congress.     Cole : What were they?    McCullough : They were photographs taken of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after the flood. A Pittsburgh photographer had somehow gotten his heavy glass plates and all that paraphernalia over the mountains into the city.    My wife and I--it was a Saturday--had gone to the Library of Congress to look up some things in the old prints and photographs department. There was a marvelous man there named Milton Kaplan, a specialist on prints and photographs. He took me to a table where they had just spread out these photographs they had acquired. We stopped to look. I was astounded by the violence of what had happened and the drama of it. I grew up in that part of Pennsylvania and I had heard about the Johnstown flood all my life. I knew that a dam had broken, but beyond that I didn't know anything, and I was curious. I took a book out of the library, and it wasn't very good. I took another book out and it was, if anything, even less satisfactory.     I remembered a line from an interview that Thornton Wilder had given to the  Paris Review  about how he came up with the ideas for the novels and the plays he wrote. He'd said, ""I imagine a story I'd like to read in a book or see performed on the stage and if I find nobody has written it, I write it so I can read it in a book or perform it on the stage."" I thought, well, why don't you try and write a book about the Johnstown flood that you wished you could read?     Cole : It was just this chance encounter with these photographs.    McCullough : Yes. Once I started doing the research I realized there were survivors of the flood still alive that I could interview--and I just knew I'd found what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I had been writing for about twelve years. I knew pretty well how you could find things out, but I had never been trained in an academic way how to go about the research.     Cole : An amateur in the true sense of the word.    McCullough : People are so helpful. People will stop what they're doing to show you something, to walk with you through a section of the town, or explain how a suspension bridge really works.     Cole : They sense your enthusiasm.    McCullough : I do get enthusiastic. I have this urge to say, ""Come on over here. Look at this. This is really worth your time.""     Cole : That comes through in your books.    McCullough : All you are trying to do is to make it as interesting and as human as it really was. You don't have to gussy it up. The pull, the attraction of history, is in our human nature. What makes us tick? Why do we do what we do? How much is luck the deciding factor? I'm drawn particularly to stories that evolve out of the character of the protagonist.    Cole : It seems to me that so much of history is about vast, impersonal forces which act on people. Your books are not about that. Your books are about people, their strengths, their flaws, their heroism. I think that's one of the reasons that people are so drawn to your books.     McCullough : Well, Barbara Tuchman said, ""There's no trick to interesting people in history or children in history."" She said, ""You can explain it in two words: Tell stories.""   People ask, ""Are you working on a book?"" I say, ""Yes."" But I really want to say, ""No, I'm working in a book. I'm inside it."" I want to be inside the time.     First of all, you can make the argument that there's no such thing as the past. Nobody lived in the past.      Cole : That's right. They didn't know how it was all going to work out.    McCullough : They lived in the present. It is their present, not our present, and they don't know how it's going to come out.  They weren't just like we are because they lived in that very different time. You can't understand them if you don't understand how they perceived reality and you don't understand that unless you understand the culture. I wish we had a less fancy word than ""culture,"" because it sounds too pretentious.     Cole : And vague.    McCullough : Yes. What did they read? What poetry moved them? What music did they listen to? What did they eat? What were they afraid of? What was it like to travel from one place to another then?    Cole : One of the most vivid experiences I've had in that way was taking a couple of years to read all of Pepys's diaries.    McCullough : Wow. That's no small undertaking.    Cole : It took me years. It was bedtime reading. But that is exactly what I found so riveting: the sense of night without any illumination, no telephones, the communication, the hygiene, and the like told in this marvelous prose. It does transport you.     McCullough : That's one of the reasons I began  John Adams  as I did, with these two lone men on horseback riding through a bleak, cold winter landscape. For all intents and purposes, they're anonymous. They are coming through that winter scene, the snow and the wind, and they're going to ride nearly four hundred miles in that kind of weather, on horseback, to get to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.     These were tough people. We see the men in their frilled shirts and their satin pants and the powdered hair and they look like fops. They look like softies. Nothing doing. They were tough. And life was tough.     And yet, of course, they were not gods. Particularly talking to college audiences, I say, never, never think of them as gods. They're human beings with all the failings, flaws, and weaknesses that are part of the human condition. They were imperfect. Life was short and they knew it could end almost at any time.     I've gotten so fascinated with the eighteenth century, I'm going to stay there. I once told my wife, ""I may never come back."" My next book is also set in the eighteenth century. It's about the Revolution, with the focus on the year 1776. It's about Washington and the army and the war. It's the nadir, the low point of the United States of America.    Cole : Do you have a title?    McCullough : No. The title always comes last. What I really work hard on is the beginning. Where do you begin? In what tone do you begin? I almost have to have a scene in my mind.     Cole : Does your training in painting help you?    McCullough : I expect so, or maybe it's just we've all been so conditioned by movies. I love Dickens. I love the way he sets a scene. He said, in his great admonition to writers, ""Make me see."" I try to make you see what's happening and smell it and hear it. I want to know what they had for dinner. I want to know how long it took to walk from where to where.     Cole : That's what makes it human.    McCullough : Yes. You get into it almost the way an actor gets into a part. I want to get into this material. You scratch the supposedly dead past anywhere and what you find is life.    Cole : That's wonderful.    McCullough : There are innumerable writing problems in an extended work. This book on Adams took a little more than six years. You, the writer, change in six years. The life around you changes. Your family changes. They grow up. They move away. The world is changing. You're also learning more about the subject. By the time you're writing the last chapters of the book, you know much more than you did when you started at the beginning.    Cole : What do you do with those early chapters?    McCullough : The voice has to stay the same. So you go back and work on them, in a way, as a painter will work all over the whole canvas. I work on the front and the back and the middle all at once.   I think it's best to pick a biographical subject who lives to a ripe old age. Older people tend to relax and speak their minds. They're dropping some of the masks that they've been wearing. There's a candor.     With Adams, for example, I had a character who was in motion virtually all of his life up until he left the White House in 1801. He was going to go back to Braintree, Massachusetts, and never leave there for twenty-five years, holding no office, having no influence.  How in the world was I going to sustain that?     As it turned out, that's when the inward journey begins for John Adams, and that to me, in many ways, was the most interesting part of the book. He begins to realize that many of the things that he has thought or held to for so long he doesn't see as he did before.     The concept, for example, of the Enlightenment, that if one applied the combined intellectual efforts of a good society, there was no answer that couldn't be found. Well, he decided that really wasn't so, that inevitably there were unsolvable mysteries about life and that it was best that way.    Many of his reflections on his friends and what events in his life had mattered most went through transitions.     Cole : What promised to be an uneventful passage turned out to be quite an interesting segment of Adams's life, didn't it?    McCullough :  Indeed.    Cole : You mentioned that your new book is about the American Revolution.  That brings to mind a study done not too long ago that surveyed fifty top colleges and universities. The students were asked questions taken from a high school curriculum, and the lack of historical knowledge was really appalling.    This strikes me as something that the tragedy of 9/11 brings home. That is, our country has been attacked. Not only the World Trade Center but really the idea of our country, the ideas generated by the founders. How are we going to defend this if we really don't know much about it?     McCullough : I have been lecturing at colleges and universities continuously for twenty-five years or more. From my experience I don't think there's any question whatsoever that the students in our institutions of higher learning have less grasp of American history than ever before. We are raising a generation of young Americans who are, to a very large degree, historically illiterate.  It's not their faults. There's no problem about enlisting their interest in history. None. The problem is the teachers so often have no history in their background. Very often they were education majors and graduated knowing no subject. It's the same, I'm told, in biology or English literature or whatever.     If we think back through our own lives, the subjects that you liked best in school almost certainly were taught by the teachers you liked best. And the teacher you liked best was the teacher who cared about the subject she taught.     There was a noted professor of child psychology at the University of Pittsburgh named Margaret McFarland, whose most influential disciple is Fred Rogers, who has taught more children than any human being who ever lived. Fred Rogers likes to say that all he's done with his programs is based on the teachings of Margaret McFarland.     What she taught in essence is that attitudes aren't taught, they're caught. If the attitude of the teacher toward the material is positive, enthusiastic, committed and excited, the students get that. If the teacher is bored, students get that and they get bored, quickly, instinctively.    In my view, we have to rethink how we're teaching our teachers. There's very good work in this field being done by the National Council for History Education, which conducts summer seminars or clinics primarily for grade school teachers from all over the country. People like Ted Rabb, who is at Princeton, and Ken Jackson, who is at Columbia, are real American heroes. They are the ones that got this going.      Cole : Ted Rabb has worked closely with the NEH over the years.    McCullough : It's not just something that we should be sad about, or worried about, that these young people don't know any history. We should be angry. They are being cheated and they are being handicapped, and our way of life could very well be in jeopardy because of this.     Since September 11, it seems to me that never in our lifetime, except possibly in the early stages of World War II, has it been clearer that we have as a source of strength, a source of direction, a source of inspiration--our story. Yes, this is a dangerous time. Yes, this is a time full of shadows and fear. But we have been through worse before and we have faced more difficult days before. We have shown courage and determination, and skillful and inventive and courageous and committed responses to crisis before. We should draw on our story, we should draw on our history as we've never drawn before.    Cole : Our strength comes from our story.    McCullough : Absolutely. If we don't know who we are, if we don't know how we became what we are, we're going to start suffering from all the obvious detrimental effects of amnesia.    Cole : Collective amnesia.    McCullough : Furthermore, we face an enemy who believes in enforced ignorance. And it's what all that we stand for . . . is the open mind--    Cole : Right. Tolerance.    McCullough : --the generous spirit, the ideal of tolerance, freedom, education, opportunity. All that is in the paragraph that John Adams included in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is the oldest written constitution still in use in the world today. It predates our national constitution by ten years. ""Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of the people being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties""--you have to have wisdom and knowledge as well as virtue to preserve your rights and liberties--""and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in various parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people""--in other words, everybody--""it shall be the duty""--the duty--""of legislators and magistrates in all future periods of this commonwealth to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them. . .""     Then he goes on to say what he means by education. And what he means by education clearly is everything. No boundaries. It's all important. "". . . to encourage . . . for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, and a natural history of the country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings, sincerity, good humor""--there will be good humor--""and all social affections""--    Cole : That's wonderful.    McCullough : --""and generous sentiments among the people.""    There had never been any such statement in any proclamation or constitution ever in the history of the world.  This was radical in its day. It's saying not just that it would be a good idea to educate people, it's saying it's the duty of the government.    The pursuit of happiness. What did they mean by ""the pursuit of happiness""? They did not mean material wealth. They did not mean ease, luxury.    Cole : Happiness in our sense.    McCullough : As near as I can tell, they meant the life of the mind and the life of the spirit.     Adams wrote a letter to his boy, John Quincy, concerned that the boy not just be studying Greek and Latin, but that he be reading the great works in his own mother tongue, and particularly the English poets.      He says, ""Read somewhat in the English poets every day. You will find them elegant, entertaining and constructive companions through your whole life.""     Then he says, ""In all the disquisitions you have heard concerning the happiness of life, has it ever been recommended to you to read poetry?"" That's when he says this famous line, ""You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket.""    Cole : That's wonderful.    McCullough : Even more to the point  is a very well known paragraph where he says, ""I must study politics and war, so that my""--    Cole :  ""So the next generation""--    McCullough : --""can study art, music""--    Cole :  That's one of my favorites.    McCullough : Absolutely right. At the very end of Adams's life, Adams's doctor wrote a letter to John Quincy to say, ""I've just been to see him. But as weak as was his material frame, his mind was still enthroned.""    Cole : That's wonderful.    McCullough : Yes. One of the regrets of my life is that I did not study Latin. I'm absolutely convinced, the more I understand these eighteenth-century people, that it was that grounding in Greek and Latin that gave them their sense of the classic virtues: the classic ideals of honor, virtue, the good society, and their historic examples of what they could try to live up to.    Cole : Yes. We have a new initiative at the NEH called ""We the People,"" which is a response to 9/11. It is aimed at getting people in all walks of life thinking about what it means to be an American--our liberties, all those things we were attacked for. After 9/11, it seems to me that this is something essential. That's why it is so alarming that you have this kind of historical amnesia.     McCullough :  There is a notable rise in popular interest in history as measured by the success, for example, of The History Channel on television. There are other measures: the long run that  The American Experience  has had on PBS, the success of the presidential series that C-SPAN ran, the reading audience for books like mine and Edmund Morris's  Theodore Rex  and others. The level of knowledge of those we're educating seems on the decline while the general interest seems to be on the rise.    Cole : That's the paradox. I think of The History Channel and  The American Experience  as a kind of public university.    McCullough : Maybe because so many people didn't learn these things in college, they're curious to find out. But we need to get them young. Little children can learn anything, just as they can learn a foreign language. The mind is so absorbent then. There ought to be a real program to educate teachers who want to teach grade school children about history.      Another good classroom program has the children act a part. In my granddaughter's fifth-grade class, two sections are doing the American presidents. Each child is a president and/or a first lady. I was astounded by how much they know. The child who is Dolley Madison or James K. Polk--they're never going to forget that.   I'm absolutely positive it's in our human nature to want to know about the past. The two most popular movies of all time, while not historically accurate, are about core historic events: Gone With the Wind and Titanic. There is a human longing to go back to other times. We all know how when we were children we asked our parents, ""What was it like when you were a kid?"" I think it probably has something to do with our survival as a species. For nine-tenths of the time that human beings have been on earth, knowledge that was essential to survival was transmitted from one generation to the next by the vehicle of story.     My strong feeling is that we must learn more about how we learn. I'm convinced that we learn by struggling to find the solution to a problem on our own--with some guidance, but getting in and getting our hands dirty and working it.    Cole : So we really understand it. When we do it that way, we really know it. It's not superimposed.    McCullough : If you had to take that typewriter or that automobile engine apart and put it back together, you'd never forget it.    Cole : That's right.    McCullough : I opened a closet in the attic of the old library at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute one beautiful fall afternoon, and there were all the records and the private correspondence and the scrapbooks and the photographs and the drawings of the Brooklyn Bridge, just stashed in that closet, no catalog, no index--nobody really knew what all was there--bundles of letters tied up with shoestrings the way it had been when the Roebling family turned it over.     I spent three years trying to untangle all that, trying to understand it. It's been thirty years, and I'm sure I could sit down now and take a test and do extremely well on that subject. I'll never ever forget it.    Cole : You put that engine together.    McCullough : We've all crammed for exams, maybe did very well on the exams, and three weeks later--    Cole : It's gone.    McCullough : --it's gone. So I think we have got to bring the lab technique to the teaching of the humanities to a far greater degree than we have. There are ways that can be done. And they're exciting.     I am adamant that we must not cut back on funding of the teaching of the arts in the schools: music, painting, theater, dance, all of it. The great thing about the arts is that the only way you learn how to do it is by doing it. If a child learns nothing but that as a guide to life, that's invaluable. You can't learn to play the piano without playing the piano, you can't learn to write without writing, and, in many ways, you can't learn to think without thinking. Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.    Cole : That's right. I don't think you know what you know until you write it.    McCullough : Exactly. We all know the old expression, ""I'll work my thoughts out on paper."" There's something about the pen that focuses the brain in a way that nothing else does. That is why we must have more writing in the schools, more writing in all subjects, not just in English classes.     The talent, including the talent for history--and I do think there are people who just have a talent for it, the way you have a talent for public speaking or music or whatever--it shouldn't be allowed to lie dormant. It should be brought alive.    Cole : Terrific. Thank you for taking the time to talk about the making of history--and the writing of it.    McCullough : I've enjoyed it.                                                 Humanities , May/June 2003"

Five different concerts will take place June 26, 27, 28 and July 3 and 5 as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. All concerts will be held from 6:00 - 9:00 pm at the Harmony Stage on the Mall. Other fine musicians will join the Heritage Fellows in this celebration of music from the mountains and valleys of Appalachia. A detailed concert schedule and National Heritage Fellow biographies are attached.      When the National Endowment for the Arts initiated the National Heritage Fellows program in 1982, two of that first year's recipients were fiddler Tommy Jarrell from Mt. Airy, North Carolina, who played string band music, and mandolin player and composer Bill Monroe from Rosine, Kentucky, considered to be the father of bluegrass.      Since that inaugural year, 272 fellowships have been awarded, of which, 41 went to artists in the five-state Appalachian region of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The musical traditions, country, bluegrass, old-time string band, gospel, and folk, are an integral part of our nation's artistic heritage and musical present.      As part of its efforts to honor and preserve our nation's diverse cultural heritage, the National Endowment for the Arts annually awards National Heritage Fellowships for master folk and traditional artists. These fellowships are intended to recognize the recipients' artistic excellence and support their continuing contributions to our nation's traditional arts heritage. The selection criteria are authenticity, excellence, and significance within the particular artistic tradition. Fellowships originate with nominations from the public. The fellowship award is $20,000. The NEA National Heritage Fellows of Appalachia concert series is presented in collaboration with the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance. This year's festival is the 37th annual folk gathering on the National Mall produced by the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage and co-sponsored by the National Park Service. The Birthplace of Country Music Alliance is located in Bristol, Tennessee and is dedicated to calling attention to the crucial role played by artists from East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and the southern Appalachian region in country, bluegrass, and other musical avenues that have been nurtured by this region.

He became a member of the Southern Ramblers at the age of 14, regularly appearing on an early morning radio show on WOPI, the ""Voice of Appalachia."" He continued to perform until 1955, when he gave up music to take a job with Tennessee Eastman to support his family. In 1980, he retired from the plant and once again took up fiddling, forming the New Southern Ramblers with members of the Green Grass Cloggers. He continues to perform, in addition to teaching and giving workshops, throughout the country. [See  extended profile of  Ralph Blizard  on the web site.]       JOHN CEPHAS (1989 FELLOW)  Piedmont Blues Guitarist/Singer  Woodford, VA      John Cephas is a master of the Piedmont style of finger-picking, named for the region where the style of guitar playing originated. The Piedmont style involves alternating thumb- and finger-picking while keeping a constant bass line with the thumb. Cephas learned guitar by listening to old 78 rpm recordings of the blues, and was especially influenced by Blind Boy Fuller, Reverend Gary Davis, and Blind Lemon Jefferson. In the 1970s, he met harmonica player Phil Wiggins at a party in Washington, DC, and the pair have continued playing together nationally and internationally ever since.        CLYDE DAVENPORT (1992 FELLOW)  Appalachian Fiddler  Jamestown, TN      Clyde Davenport took an interest in music when he was just nine years old, making his own fiddle out of barn boards, with mule hair for bowstrings. The greatest musical influence on Davenport was the fiddle and banjo duo of Blind Dick Burnett and Leonard Rutherford, particularly Rutherford's long-bowing fiddle technique. Davenport's solo playing is in the traditional style of the Appalachian region, although he also includes quick-tempo breakdowns and blues in his repertoire. He knows more than 200 fiddle tunes, many of which are rare, that he learned from his father, grandfather, and older neighbors. In addition to playing, Davenport is also a renowned instrument maker and repairman.       HAZEL DICKENS (2001 FELLOW)  Appalachian Singer/Songwriter  Washington, DC      Hazel Dickens grew up in the coal-mining country of West Virginia, and the harsh conditions in which her family lived and worked deeply affected her and her art. In the 1960s, Dickens teamed up with another singer, Alice Gerrard, and together they brought a strong feminist viewpoint to traditional music. In the 1970s, Dickens pursued a solo career, where she acted as an advocate for the plight of coal miners. Her distinctive sound brings together the socially conscious songwriting abilities of Woody Guthrie, the singing skills of Kitty Wells, and the unadorned style of Baptist hymns she learned from her father.          WAYNE HENDERSON (1995 FELLOW)  Appalachian Luthier/Musician  Mouth of Wilson, VA      Growing up in a remote area of the Blue Ridge Mountains, household items were hard to come by, so Wayne Henderson and his family often made what they needed themselves. This started Henderson on the way to becoming a master luthier, or maker of stringed instruments. Because of the high quality of his work, there are waiting lists of more than two years to obtain one of Henderson's beautiful, handcrafted guitars. Henderson is also an accomplished guitarist who has been featured on the ""Masters of the Steel String Guitar"" tour and has traveled internationally with the United States Information Agency.        JOHN DEE HOLEMAN (1988 FELLOW)  Piedmont Blues Guitarist/Singer/Dancer  Durham, NC      John Dee Holeman began picking guitar when he was 14, quickly learning the Piedmont-style blues songs he heard his uncle and cousin play. He also learned the tradition of ""patting juba,"" the use of complex hand rhythms to provide timing for dancers, and the ""buckdance,"" one of the dances performed to the juba rhythm. Holeman teamed up with Fris Holloway, an experienced ""patter"" and blues piano player, and the two performed together for years, including a U.S. Department of State tour of Southeast Asia. Although never pursuing music as a full-time profession, Holeman continues to perform music and dance at concerts and festivals around the country, as well as in Europe and Africa.         WILL KEYS (1996 FELLOW)  Appalachian Banjo Player  Gray, TN      Will Keys was born into a large musical family, the tenth of eleven children, and began learning the banjo at eight years old. He learned the two-finger style, as opposed to the popular three-finger or claw-hammer styles, and played with his brothers in weekend jam sessions. In 1978, he won the old-time banjo contest at the prestigious Galax Fiddler's Convention. Despite his musical ability, he worked a full-time job at the Eastman Chemical Company for 42 years. After his retirement in 1984, Keys began performing more regularly, playing at folk festivals, and teaching workshops. Using his fingers rather than a pick to pluck the strings gives his banjo playing a distinctive sound with a bell-like tone.         JESSE McREYNOLDS (1997 FELLOW)  Bluegrass Musician  Gallatin, TN      Jesse McReynolds and his brother Jim began playing together in the early 1940s and stayed together for more than 50 years, until Jim's death in December 2002. The McReynolds brothers had continued the musical tradition that their grandfather started when he played on the original Bristol Sessions of 1927. With Jesse on mandolin and Jim on guitar, their distinctive harmony singing-learned from their mother-set them apart from other Appalachian bands of the era. In the early 1950s, Jesse developed a mandolin cross-picking technique, creating a banjo-like syncopation effect, that was soon widely imitated by his peers. He continues to perform the bluegrass music that has been such an important part of his life.           JEAN RITCHIE (2002 BESS LOMAX HAWES AWARD)  Appalachian Musician/Songwriter  Port Washington, NY      Jean Ritchie was the youngest of 14 children, growing up in the Cumberland Mountains of eastern Kentucky. After graduating from college, she moved to New York City, where she worked at the Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side, teaching children folk songs, ballads, and singing games. During this time, noted folklorist Alan Lomax recorded her playing the lap dulcimer for the Library of Congress and arranged her first formal concert at Columbia University. Besides writing such classics as ""The L&N Don't Stop Here Anymore,"" Ritchie has also written books about folk music, including the highly regarded  Singing Family of the Cumberlands .         RALPH STANLEY (1984 FELLOW)  Bluegrass Banjo Player  Coeburn, VA      Ralph Stanley was born in Virginia's Clinch Mountains, which have inspired much of his music. He and his brother Carter learned ballad singing and claw-hammer-style banjo playing from their mother, and they began performing together in the 1940s, gathering a following from their broadcasts on WCYB in Bristol, Virginia. In 1966, Carter died, and after much consideration, Ralph continued his musical career and formed a new band. He helped bring about a revival of a cappella singing in contemporary bluegrass, continuing the tradition he learned from his mother. There has been a resurgent interest in Stanley's music after some of his performances were used on the soundtrack to  O Brother, Where Art Thou? , released in 2000.        JOSEPH WILSON (2001 BESS LOMAX HAWES AWARD)  Folklorist/Presenter  Takoma Park, MD      Joseph Wilson has had a lifelong interest in music, producing records by musicians in his hometown of Trade, Tennessee before joining the National Council for the Traditional Arts - then called the National Folk Festival Association - in 1976. As executive director of the nonprofit organization, a title he still holds, he directs its activities, such as producing the internationally renowned National Folk Festival; conducting research in folklore, ethnography, and related areas; assisting the National Park Service with planning and interpretation; and producing films, recordings, museum exhibits, and publications. He is also a founding member of the Fund for Folk Culture, and has served as a panelist for the National Endowment for the Arts and on the grants panels of four state arts agencies.

GX018-59-6547051	Spring 1999:  More Presidential Pets                 President Calvin Coolidge                 Our 30th President, Calvin Coolidge, and his wife, Grace, were so well known for         their devotion to animals that people all over the world shipped animals to         them.¬†¬† Among the many animals given to them by friends, foreign leaders,         and the general public were cats, dogs, birds, a raccoon, a baby bear, a wallaby,         a pair of lion cubs, an antelope, a large white goose, a donkey, a pigmy hippo,         and a bobcat.¬†¬† President Coolidge's favorite pet was a raccoon named         Rebecca;¬†¬† he built a special house for her, visited her every day, and         walked her around the White House on a leash.¬†¬† When the White House was         being repaired and President Coolidge and his family moved temporarily, the         President worried that Rebecca might get lonely, so he sent a limousine to bring         her from the White House to stay with them.                        President Franklin Delano Roosevelt takes time during his busy day to visit with a young friend and Fala.One of the most famous Presidential pets was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's constant         companion, Fala.¬†¬† Fala, a Scottish terrier, was given to President         Roosevelt by his cousin, Margaret Suckley, who thought that the pup would ease         some of the President's stress during the difficult days of World War         II.¬†¬† Fala's full name was Murray of Fala Hill after a famous Roosevelt         ancestor.¬†¬† Fala almost never left the President's side.¬†¬† In         fact, when Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt signed the Atlantic Charter         in 1941 on the U.S.S.  Augusta  in the mid-Atlantic, Fala was right there with         the two world leaders.¬†¬† And at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in         Washington, D.C., a statue of Fala sits next to that of his favorite companion,         the President.                         Margaret Suckley helped to write a biography of Fala entitled  The True Story of         Fala .¬†¬† Two First Ladies have also written books related to White         House pets.¬†¬† First Lady Barbara Bush helped her springer spaniel,         Millie, to write  Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush , which is a         dog's-eye view of the White House during the Bush Administration.¬†¬† And         First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton compiled a book entitled  Dear Socks, Dear         Buddy  that includes letters from young people from all over the world who have         written to the Clinton family pets.                        John and Caroline Kennedy show their new pony, Macaroni, to their father, President John F. Kennedy.        No discussion of America's First Pets would be complete without mentioning those         of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his family.¬†¬† President Kennedy brought         to the White House a collection of animals that continued to expand while he was         in office.¬†¬† First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy designed a special play area         for the children by the West Wing, complete with living quarters for their dogs,         rabbits, guinea pigs, and ponies.¬†¬† The most famous of these was Caroline         Kennedy's pony, Macaroni, given to her by then-Vice President Lyndon         Johnson.¬†¬† Macaroni received many letters from children all over the         world and proudly pulled the two Kennedy children in a sleigh around the South Lawn         when the ground was covered with snow.

GX007-64-15703560	David McCullough                        History teaches and reinforces what we believe in, what we stand for, and what we ought to be willing to stand up for, David McCullough writes. History is about life--human nature and the human condition and all its trials and failings and noblest achievements.   For nearly half a century McCullough has been creating portraits of memorable figures in American history. He writes about a Civil War veteran whose fierce determination builds a bridge to Brooklyn; he writes about a man who endures long absences from the wife he loves for what may be a greater love of country; he writes about a World War I artillery officer who discovers he could lead men and liked that better than anything he had done before.   The man, Captain Harry of Battery D, became thirty-third president of the United States and is the subject of McCulloughs book,  Truman , which won the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1993. McCullough received a second Pulitzer in 2002 for his book on another American president,  John Adams . The honors continue: two National Book Awards, two Francis Parkman Prizes, and honorary doctorates from thirty-five universities.   McCullough is this years Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities, the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished achievement in the humanities. It is his second recognition from the Endowment. In 1995 he received the Charles Frankel Prize, now called the National Humanities Medal, for his contributions to public understanding of the humanities through his books, and his work on television as the voice of  American Experience  and documentaries such as Ken Burnss  The Civil War .   If nations appointed historians laureate, book critic Edwin M. Yoder Jr. once wrote, David McCullough would surely be ours.   McCullough, who was born in Pittsburgh and was graduated from Yale, lives in West Tisbury, Massachusetts. He and his wife Rosalee have five children and sixteen grandchildren. His avocation, he tells Endowment Chairman Bruce Cole, is painting. As a young man he was interested in becoming an artist, but decided he would not make a living that way and shifted careers. The change has suited him.   To me, history ought to be a source of pleasure, McCullough has said. It isnt just part of our civic responsibility. To me its an enlargement of the experience of being alive, just the way literature or art or music is.   His study of America and its past has taken him from a natural disaster in a mining town in Pennsylvania to the pleasure of pony rides with the Roosevelts at Oyster Bay. At the moment he is working on another defining scene in the American canvas, a book about 1776 and the testing of George Washington at Valley Forge--a time that McCullough describes as the nadir of the American Revolution.   The choice of subject should not be unexpected. When McCullough received an honorary degree from Yale in 2000, the citation read, As an historian, he paints with words, giving us pictures of the American people that live, breathe, and above all, confront the fundamental issues of courage, achievement, and moral character.   Finally, in this issue of  Humanities  we leave the early days of our democracy to travel half a world away to the anything-but-democratic intrigues of czarist Russia. This year marks the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of St. Petersburg, the city that would become the emblem of a young aristocrat with colossal ambitions. His schemes were on a grand scale and some may have remained unrealized, but the citys cultural inheritance endures.   --Mary Lou Beatty                               Humanities , May/June 2003
GX028-67-0815792	"Dr. William Mc Clelland     by   Stefan Bielinski          According to his obituary,  William Mc Clelland  was born in Galloway, Scotland in 1768. He was educated at ""Endinburgh"" and came to America at an early age!     After 1796, he married the young widow Annatie Hoffman Ten Eyck. He was a member and trustee of the First  Presbyterian  church where their child, ""Genet,"" was baptized in November 1798.    He was a  physician  and was active in Albany medical circles. He was a member of the Albany County and New York State Medical Societies. He was president of the Albany St. Andrew's Society. He taught several physicians and was associated with a number of area physicians. He was called ""a practical Scot.""    In 1799, his  first ward  property appeared on the city assessment roll. In 1800, his household included four children under ten, two males and three females (perhaps including his wife) 16-24, no women older than that, and three slaves. By 1810, the  census  identified three free persons of color instead of slaves in his household.      Crippled by sickness, Dr. William Mc Clelland died in January 1812 at the age of forty-three. He was  buried  in the Presbyterian cemetery plot. The  city directory  for 1813 listed his widow across town at 16  Van Tromp  Street.                notes       Sources:  The life of Dr. William Mc Clelland has not been assigned a CAP  biography number .

But this one is special. This story involves 1,000 and (1) children       from  Jack Jackter Elementary       School  in a small, cozy, friendly town in  Colchester ,       Connecticut.         Today was our third day of working with       children from Kindergarten through 3rd grade to help them with their       contribution to the Longest Children's Mural in the World. We believe we       have stumbled onto a Utopia of sorts‚Ä¶.with every child beautiful and       smiling, and with hardly a frazzled teacher in sight. (Maybe a substitute       here and there!)         More importantly, we have come to know some       pretty incredible parents. And there aren't any words to describe       the Multicultural Coordinator and Lynn, our friend who took this project       on with a passion and went to the maximum to make it a maximum experience.       Even the Art Teachers gave up their room and taught Art on a Cart!         But the real story is about a little       two-year old girl named Jenna who watched from her little stroller today       as 12 classes of 21-22 children from 2nd and 1st grade came trooping in       every 40 minutes. Jenna was the real super star. She sat there with her       smock (her Dad's shirt), twisting and turning it‚Ä¶covering her head,       acting shy, but all the while watching the school kids come and go through       this totally structured routine of drawing and painting on the murals. She       saw them crawl on the floor, raising their hands asking for help, spilling       their little mini-cups of water, and smudging paint on their smocks‚Ä¶elbows,       bellies, and other places only their Moms and Dads will know about in       tomorrow's wash!           In between the classes, her Mom would set       her free from the stroller and she would dance happily around the room,       looking at the growing numbers of colorful butterflies, flowers, fish and       bumblebees. And she would find a way to ""help"" by picking up the       very heavy rolls of industrial school type rough brown paper towels and       setting them where she thought they were needed. I finally figured out she       was moving them to where she saw the spills happen last!         She was really joyful‚Ä¶laughing and       running, but always careful and respectful not to step on paint palettes       or to tip over the cups of water all over the room. She even allowed her       photo to be taken! She did manage to take a break at one point and eat a       cookie that was freshly baked by her 92 year old Nana. And this she did       ceremoniously, quietly, and thoughtfully, as if her Nana were there       watching. And then, as she heard the sound of the children approaching       down the halls, she would run to her stroller and sit in it, waiting to       repeat her little game of being shy with the newest batch of young mural       painters, and waiting and watching them again, so very patiently until       they finished.         Jenna, the pretty little black-eyed Italian       girl even knew her name and her age and behaved so well for such a long       while. I looked at her as she yawned and sighed toward the end of her day,       but she still remained charming and teasing. But what was more powerful,       is she seemed to comprehend that all these children were there for a       purpose. She remained observant and coy as she truly understood that this       extraordinary day was meant to bring children together-to see them working       in peace and harmony-to see them be creative, spontaneous, having fun,       working steadfastly, laughing together, yet incredibly, well behaved. She       watched them bring something from inside their hearts and heads and draw       and paint what came out onto the stretches of canvas. And yes, how she       marveled at the beautiful electric colors they created. Some of the       palettes with such wonderful colors looked good enough to eat! (Actually       some blue paint ended up in my California avocado and sprouts wrap and       yes, I did eat it)         Jenna got to see how hundreds of children       could work together on a common project.        Jenna got to see them work with respect and understanding, with sharing       and caring, and cooperation among them. Jenna goes to see her Mom and       others come in and work with teachers and students as if they too, were       part of her family. And that's how we felt it was at Jack Jackter       Elementary School. Jenna got to be what we all have wished for at one       point in time-- the little ""fly on the wall"".         And so tonight, Jenna, as you are sound       asleep in your bed in your room, in your house with your two older sisters       who got to paint on the mural, you will dream of all those butterflies,       and flowers, and the electric colored fish, and all the ""older""       children working like bees in a hive. And even though you weren't there       when Fox 61 TV came to film kids at work, you got to see it all. And when       this mural is completed tomorrow, your face, your help, and your spirit       will be there too with the ""Mile of Smiles"" we saw all this       week. We promise you it is because we have your photo.         And so, to Jack Jackter Elementary School,       and the thoughtfulness you all extended to us including the wonderful       ""Welcome       Fouad and Joanne"" sign on the front of the school, we thank you for       such a warm and loving experience. You are the ones that reinforce our       belief that we are doing the right thing! It is through you and your       cooperative efforts that our children just might have a chance to make       this world a better place to live.         ¬†                                     International                 Women ‚Äôs Day¬†                                                                                    by   Joanne               Tawfilis,  March 12, 2001                                                With         every new mural we have the opportunity and privilege of meeting new and         wonderful people. This mural story is about women. Women who make a         difference. Last summer, an incredible woman I had met in England named         Rachael Paulson brought a little boy into all of our lives. His name was         Alex and she had read about him in the newspaper. Alex was suffering         from Cancer. Alex had never gone to school and was desperately ill and         the local New Jersey newspapers covered a very emotional story about him         and his courageous family Rachael initiated the contact with Alex's         family for us to do a mural with him and it was a happening.           Two young high school students that         worked in our Connecticut based Children's Gallery created a beautiful         sketch inspired by Alex's story. But they had never seen Alex or picture         of him. To our surprise, the little boy they sketched onto the canvas         did resemble Alex with his large brown eyes‚Ä¶peering out a window from         his toy filled room onto the constellations and the realm of all         children's imaginations. Rachael's Global Kids joined Alex at his home         to work on the mural. It was magic. It has beautiful colors, and a big         lion, a dinosaur, twinkling stars, a wizard, and more-it has the         signatures of 110 other children that are ill and recuperating from         varying forms and stages of cancer! And Rachael and I both wanted his         family to use the mural for a fund raiser their local communities were         organizing, and as an expression of hope that came from so many         suffering from so much.           Alex's Mother, Patti was also an         incredible woman. She had discovered Alex's illness while she was         hospitalized giving birth to Alex's little sister. However, her family         was like a Gift from God to me. The devotion, loyalty, tenderness,         patience and absolute bonds of love between that family were phenomenal.         I shall never forget the feeling I got when I watched Alex's Mom care         for her son or the way his Dad came home from work while we were         painting to come joyfully to his family and a scene of semi-chaos while         the Global Kids, Rachael and myself acrylicized his backyard.           During this same time, I also met several         wonderful women counselors and outreach workers who had invited our         children's gallery to do a mural for a whole different scenario and         project. These courageous women worked with families who were Victims of         Domestic Violence at a Wellness Center in Connecticut. Among them was a         round and robust genteel woman named Elizabeth, who portrayed the         characteristic of warmth, love, and caring that, simply seeped out into         the shelter in which the women worked. We were told that she could sing         like an angel, and that each of the workers in the shelter loved her and         she them. Before we left, Elizabeth insisted on a hug. It was one of         those Earth Mother hugs‚Ä¶all encompassing and warm, lingering, and full         of sincere zest for life and those who cherish it.           Just before the Christmas holidays came,         the day came for us to bring the materials to the Center and get started         on the murals arrived. However, we noticed that Elizabeth was not there.         The Director sadly informed us that Elizabeth had been diagnosed with         pancreatic cancer and would soon start treatments. We were shocked by         the news and felt a twinge in our tummies knowing that the disease had         stricken yet another wonderful person. We kicked off the mural project         and left the materials behind for the Center to continue through the         holidays and when time permitted.           Just before International Women's Day, I         had asked Rachael if she had heard about any progress regarding Alex's         condition. She informed me that Alex was recuperating and sent me an         email that simply read ""Call Alex's Phone Number!"" I did so,         and to my delight Alex's voice was on the message‚Ä¶I screeched with         joy. The good news‚Ä¶Alex was alive and getting better all the time.         Today I received an email from his Mom, Patti and somehow I could see         her at the computer writing this message informing us of Alex's much         improved condition. Incredible Lady and I felt so much joy‚Ä¶awesome         joy.                    On International Women's Day, during this millennium year, we went to         the Wellness Center to pick up the mural that had been completed. I saw         Elizabeth's desk in the same entryway, but none of these great women         were in at the time, with the exception of one who was working upstairs         with a family. When she came down the stairs, I asked about Elizabeth.         She told us that Elizabeth had passed away in February. I was stunned. I         felt the bottom fall out of my stomach and I felt grief and denial pass         through me. Incredible grief. Awesome grief.           And so the mural painting and the Art         Miles continue, as does life. As for Rachael, she continues making         connections and doing good works with her Global Kids and others. Patti         will continue her heart and family battle to bring Alex through to         complete healing‚Ä¶and Elizabeth, I hear you up there singing your heart         out on this Millennium International Women's Day‚Ä¶and we feel your         love, your zest for life, and of course, your awesome joy!                ¬†                 ¬†      Disclaimer ¬†and  Privacy Policy .¬† Copyright @ 2003 State of Connecticut.¬†  Send mail to  ConneCT.kidspage@po.state.ct.us ."
GX024-05-9050810	Our 30th President, Calvin Coolidge, and his wife, Grace, were so well known for         their devotion to animals that people all over the world shipped animals to         them.¬†¬† Among the many animals given to them by friends, foreign leaders,         and the general public were cats, dogs, birds, a raccoon, a baby bear, a wallaby,         a pair of lion cubs, an antelope, a large white goose, a donkey, a pigmy hippo,         and a bobcat.¬†¬† President Coolidge's favorite pet was a raccoon named         Rebecca;¬†¬† he built a special house for her, visited her every day, and         walked her around the White House on a leash.¬†¬† When the White House was         being repaired and President Coolidge and his family moved temporarily, the         President worried that Rebecca might get lonely, so he sent a limousine to bring         her from the White House to stay with them.                                     One of the most famous Presidential pets was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's constant         companion, Fala.¬†¬† Fala, a Scottish terrier, was given to President         Roosevelt by his cousin, Margaret Suckley, who thought that the pup would ease         some of the President's stress during the difficult days of World War         II.¬†¬† Fala's full name was Murray of Fala Hill after a famous Roosevelt         ancestor.¬†¬† Fala almost never left the President's side.¬†¬† In         fact, when Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt signed the Atlantic Charter         in 1941 on the U.S.S.  Augusta  in the mid-Atlantic, Fala was right there with         the two world leaders.¬†¬† And at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in         Washington, D.C., a statue of Fala sits next to that of his favorite companion,         the President.                            Margaret Suckley helped to write a biography of Fala entitled  The True Story of         Fala .¬†¬† Two First Ladies have also written books related to White         House pets.¬†¬† First Lady Barbara Bush helped her springer spaniel,         Millie, to write  Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush , which is a         dog's-eye view of the White House during the Bush Administration.¬†¬† And         First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton compiled a book entitled  Dear Socks, Dear         Buddy  that includes letters from young people from all over the world who have         written to the Clinton family pets.                                     No discussion of America's First Pets would be complete without mentioning those         of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his family.¬†¬† President Kennedy brought         to the White House a collection of animals that continued to expand while he was         in office.¬†¬† First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy designed a special play area         for the children by the West Wing, complete with living quarters for their dogs,         rabbits, guinea pigs, and ponies.¬†¬† The most famous of these was Caroline         Kennedy's pony, Macaroni, given to her by then-Vice President Lyndon         Johnson.¬†¬† Macaroni received many letters from children all over the         world and proudly pulled the two Kennedy children in a sleigh around the South Lawn         when the ground was covered with snow.

The work of five students from BA schools was selected last                      spring.

GX246-08-6591323	No Need to Rush: The Chinese, Placer Mining, and the Western Environment   ¬†   By Liping Zhu   ¬†   CURRICULUM   ¬†       Few places in nineteenth-century America gathered more ethnic groups than did the western mining frontier. In the twenty-six years from James W. Marshall‚Äôs discovery of gold at Sutter‚Äôs mill in California in 1848 to General George A. Custer‚Äôs finding gold in Dakota‚Äôs Black Hills in 1874, continuous gold rushes attracted hundreds of thousands of people from all parts of the world. Their coming accelerated the region‚Äôs exploitation and settlement at an unexpected speed. Among the contributors to that exploitation were the Chinese. Of all ethnic group prospectors, the Chinese were the most ubiquitous and distinguishable, often edging out other groups in what amounted to an economic contest. Their historical significance in placer mining--their ubiquity, persistence, and success--is still not wholly recognized, but the sesquicentennial of the California gold rush provides an ideal opportunity to assess and commemorate their remarkable achievements on the western mining frontier.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Marshall‚Äôs accidental discovery of gold on the south fork of California‚Äôs American River in early 1848 inaugurated the first gold rush to the American West, and among the very first gold rushers were several Chinese. Hearing of the news, a merchant named Chum Ming of San Francisco immediately joined the first wave of prospectors into the Sierra Nevada. Afterward, he wrote of his good fortune to friends and relatives in China. About the same time, the American brig Eagle arrived in San Francisco. On board were Charles V. Gillespie‚Äôs three Chinese servants--two men and a woman. As soon as they heard of the gold strike, the two men deserted their master and headed for the hills. To this day, what became of them is unknown.1       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  News of gold in California traveled quickly along the entire Pacific Rim, from Peru to Australia to Manila, and finally to China. Australia received word in June 1848, and Canton learned of the discovery in October, only a few days after the news had reached the East Coast of the United States.2 Americans and Europeans, not the Chinese themselves, helped spread the message across China. Foreseeing a profitable business in human cargo, captains of western vessels tried to capitalize on China‚Äôs misfortunes wrought by foreign and domestic wars. Launching an intensive advertising campaign with the help of local agents, clever captains distributed placards, posters, and maps, all with what one historian called ‚Äúhighly colored accounts of the golden hills of California.‚Äù3 Exaggerated circulars tempted adventurous and desperate alike; some Chinese sailed for America right away. It took only about six weeks to cross the Pacific Ocean from China compared to six months to traverse the American continent east to west. Thus, the shorter traveling time played to Chinese advantage.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† In the first three years, however, most Chinese responded to the California excitement with  characteristic caution. Of the tens of thousands of pioneers pouring into California, only 325 were forty-niners from China. The San Francisco Custom House received 450 more Chinese in 1850 and 2,716 in 1851. After returning home with handsome fortunes, some early Chinese adventurers convinced their countrymen of real golden hills in California. The Taiping Rebellion, which broke out in southern China in 1851 and spread destruction across half of China before being suppressed in 1864, encouraged many to flee the country. Indeed, in thirteen years of civil war, the rebellion‚Äôs death toll alone came to twenty million people.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  A combination of push and pull factors thus triggered a wave of Chinese immigration to America. More than 20,000 Chinese arrived in the United States in 1852, quickly augmenting the number of Chinese in California, which reached 34,933 on the eve of the Civil War. Of these Chinese, some three-fourths lived in counties where mining was the principal occupation. Most Chinese miners missed the initial rush, but they gradually took control of California placer mining. Within a decade they possessed most of the claims in the original strike region and together constituted the single largest national group of miners. Their slow start and quick dominance in California‚Äôs mines formed a distinctive pattern that would be repeated throughout the mining West.4        ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Where others led, the Chinese followed. Without participating in the series of frantic western mining stampedes, the Chinese nonetheless gradually spread to almost every corner of the West. Their extensive placer operations reached Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the 1850s; Idaho and Montana in the 1860s; and Arizona, Colorado, and Dakota in the 1870s. Obtaining claims either through purchase or preemption, the Chinese gradually made themselves the most prominent group in the industry. In the heyday of their mining activities in the early 1870s, 17,069 Chinese constituted more than 25 percent of all miners in the West. In some states and territories, the percentage was even higher: 58.5 percent in Idaho, for example; 61.2 percent in Oregon; and some 60 percent in California.5 This disproportionate representation of Chinese immigrants in western mining continued until the mid-1880s. As a result, a huge quantity of American treasure passed into the hands of Asian miners and their families. From 1855 to 1870, the Port of San Francisco alone recorded shipments of $72,581,219 in gold and silver to China.6       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Despite their success and widespread presence, Chinese miners in nineteenth-century America have received little scholarly attention and few in-depth studies. The lack of books and articles limits our ability to understand either Chinese placering or western mining generally. Why did these Asian latecomers, who possessed no legal or economic advantage, eventually outdo so many others in the placer industry? Contemporary writers and popular literature of the time often attributed Chinese success to a distinctive frugality and patience. Describing the situation at Auburn, Oregon, in 1861, one contemporary concluded: ‚ÄúThe Chinese patiently panned the gulches until there was scarcely an ounce of gold in the tailings of other days.‚Äù7       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Without further study, later generations willingly accepted such casual comments as historical truth. Summarizing the reasons for Chinese mining success, noted mining historian Rodman Paul wrote: ‚ÄúHaving been simple peasants or laborers accustomed to a limited standard of living in their overcrowded native land, the Chinese immigrants were willing to work for much smaller returns than white miners.‚Äù8 The statement became a standard interpretation of Chinese achievement in western mining. While true that the Chinese, who missed every major rush, often worked over the claims abandoned by whites and still made money, their success in a foreign, often unfriendly land required more than simple patience and frugality. In fact, a number of characteristics distinguished the Chinese from other groups.       Mining activity and the Chinese diaspora had been inseparable since the seventeenth century. Following in the Manila galleons that visited their country for trade in the late 1500s, Chinese ventured to Mexico and Peru in search of economic opportunity. As early as the 1600s, some immigrants joined the Indians in Zacatecas, Mexico, to mine silver. Elsewhere, the Netherlands, England, and France sought to defend their colonies in Southeast Asia against Spain and Portugal by inviting the Chinese to settle in Indochina, Malaya, Siam, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the Pacific islands. Gold mining joined sugar planting as a Chinese monopoly in these regions.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  As early as the 1730s and 1740s, the Chinese began working in the diamond and gold mines of Southeast Asia. To defend themselves against pirates and native gangs, they traveled more often in groups than individually. These groups became the initial mining companies. As early as 1770 there were 10,000 Chinese mining gold in Southeast Asia. A few giant companies hired several thousand employees. Because European colonists preferred to contract Chinese companies in operations, mining passed into the hands of Chinese. Some companies established sophisticated business structures, each containing a board of trustees, executives, secretaries, accountants, treasurers, superintendents, foremen, and workers. In 1812, some 30,000 Chinese worked in Borneo‚Äôs Sambas mining district alone. On the eve of the California gold rush at least 50,000 Chinese mined gold in Borneo. Chinese also mined gold in Malaya and Sarawak and silver in Burma and Vietnam. Because they dominated the industry in many places, Chinese controlled the local mintage until the late nineteenth century.9       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Before the turn of the nineteenth century, millions of Chinese labored overseas, most of them hailing from Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces. An overwhelming majority came from Guangdong. After the colonization of Macau by Portugal and the Philippines by Spain in the sixteenth century, Canton, Guangdong‚Äôs provincial capital, became the only designated Chinese port for foreign trade. Thus, the Cantonese held an exclusive avenue to foreign commerce and overseas contact. Following the trade routes, they ventured throughout Southeast Asia and, over the ensuing three centuries, developed a tradition of overseas migration.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  High population density and lack of economic opportunity also encouraged the Cantonese to seek better fortune abroad. By mid-nineteenth century, Guangdong‚Äôs population had reached 14 million. At 86,000 square miles, the province was nearly the size of Utah, yet was and is two-thirds hills and mountains, which meant its population was clustered. The ratio of land to population was 1.67 mou per person (less than a quarter of an acre). Moreover, clans rather than individuals owned a large proportion of the arable land, which exacerbated tenancy rates, while many peasants owned no land at all. Consequently, both social tradition and economic pressures sent millions of Cantonese overseas in search of self-improvement.10       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Chinese emigration to North America represented only a trickle of the centuries-long diaspora along the Pacific Rim, which totaled more than one million Chinese. In 1851, soon after the stampede to California, gold was also discovered in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Chinese quickly embarked to Australia and within a decade numbered 38,247 there, a population they maintained for the rest of the nineteenth century. An overwhelming majority of these immigrants worked in gold mines and earned reputations as excellent miners.11       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  To revive New Zealand‚Äôs local economy, the Chamber of Commerce in Otaga Province first invited Chinese to that country in 1866. In the late nineteenth century, about 15,000 Chinese ventured to New Zealand in search of gold. Everywhere they went, Chinese immigrants kept regular contact with the motherland, including a sizable return migration. According to United States Customs Office records, in some years more Chinese left the United States than entered the country. Between 1848 and 1882 government officials documented the entry of more than 300,000 Chinese into the country, over half of whom returned home.12       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Most Chinese immigrants to Southeast Asia, Australia, and America came from the same districts (Sanyi, Siyi, and Zhongshan) of Guangdong Province. How many Chinese prospectors in America had previous training from other countries is unknown, but collectively the Cantonese had acquired considerable knowledge of precious metal mining. While ‚ÄúCousin Jack‚Äù was the name specifically used to describe Cornish immigrants who had gained fame as excellent miners at home prior to immigrating to America, ‚ÄúChina John‚Äù referred to all Chinese immigrants, many of whom had developed their mining prowess in Southeast Asia.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  The nature of western placer mining appealed to Chinese economic and cultural circumstance. All placer gold originates in igneous rock. Erosion over thousands of years gradually separates the gold from the rock and sends it into streams and rivers. Reduced in size by the grinding action of debris in flowing water, gold in small particles mixes with sand and gravel and eventually settles into riverbeds. These surface deposits of gold, found either in ancient or modern streambeds, are known as placer gold, and their extraction is called placer mining. Because it was easier to gather gold from shallow streams than deep shafts, early western prospectors, including the Chinese, labored almost exclusively at placer sites. As Rossiter W. Raymond, United States commissioner of mining statistics, reported in the early 1870s, ‚ÄúSince most of the Chinese in the United States are engaged in placer-mining on their own account, it is evident that they are well adapted for success in that branch.‚Äù13       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Placer mining represented the first phase of western mining. It required less financial investment in equipment and more cooperative activity in operation. As an observer said at the time: ‚Äúthe only capital required is muscle and honest purpose.‚Äù14 Such characteristics favored the poor Chinese peasants, who had little money to invest in expensive claims, yet possessed a strong will to extract gold.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  By their nature, surface placers do not last. When they play out, lode mining (also known as quartz or hard-rock mining) often becomes dominant. Hard-rock mining, with its deep diggings, demands large capital and sophisticated machinery, which most individual Chinese in the nineteenth-century West did not have. In addition, lode mining required different skills and special training, including the ability to study various rocks. The transition from predominantly placer to lode operations came during the 1880s, a critical time for the Chinese. The Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882, at about the same time several violent anti-Chinese riots erupted across the West. Coming together as they did, these events made Chinese immigrants uncertain about their future in this country. Even the few relatively wealthy Chinese grew unwilling to invest in hard-rock mines. Ultimately, industrial mining pushed many individual miners, including the Chinese, out of the business.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  In placer mining, however, cooperation, not individualism, was the key to success. It took several persons to operate a cradle, for example, and thus forced together people who might have preferred to work alone. Such economic alliances constituted the first gold companies. When mining became more sophisticated, dam and ditch construction demanded more labor and joint effort. Because one group‚Äôs water project might flood a neighboring property or divert all the water of another, fierce competition forced miners to band together to compete effectively for gold.15       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  For sheer cohesion, the Chinese outdistanced other groups. They always migrated, worked, and returned home in groups. Compared to that of other ethnic groups, Chinese immigration to the American West was the best organized. Their clan associations, usually known as the Chinese Six Companies, kept a complete record of all Chinese immigrants in the United States throughout the nineteenth century. Moreover, the transfer of kinship to America made the Chinese more competitive. Imbued with strong family values and social traditions, members of the same family, village, or district often ventured together and depended on each other for protection and aid.16 In mining camps, twelve to fifteen people might form a company, pooling their resources, wisdom, and muscle in search of gold. Even in hostile places, the Chinese thrived without the help of others.17 A marriage between business partners and social kinship significantly strengthened Chinese power in economic competition because few other ethnic groups shared their kind of personal bonding. The clannish culture and cooperative tradition of Asia, strange to many European immigrants, provided a team spirit essential in placer mining.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  The first challenge to the Chinese, as to anyone living in a foreign land, was to remain healthy. The Chinese fared well by adjusting to frontier conditions, and their eating habits contributed to a better physical condition. Intense physical labor in mining camps required that everyone have a hearty, high-protein diet. Because of limited meat supplies in China, Chinese people for centuries had learned to rely on fish and beans (poor man‚Äôs ‚Äúmeats‚Äù) for sufficient protein. An abundance of cattle in the American West often made beef one of the cheapest foods in mining camps. Taking advantage of this natural gift, Chinese settlers embraced beef with great enthusiasm. Meanwhile, pigs and chickens from backyard pens and ranches provided the community with additional fare, and some Chinese drove Washington hogs and Oregon cattle to Idaho mines. As a result, Chinese miners consumed an unusually large amount of meat per capita--on average, one pound daily per person--which gave them greater physical strength. This compared to Euramerican consumption of between a half and one pound of meat per capita per day.18       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Combined with their high-protein diet, the Chinese ate a lot of vitamin-rich vegetables. Altogether, they consumed a healthy combination of rice, bread, beef, pork, chicken, cabbage, potatoes, beans, onions, squash, carrots, beets, turnips, tomatoes, melons, cucumbers, sugar, and tea. It was a balanced menu that contrasted sharply with the eating habits of most white miners, who ate a monotonous diet of bread, bacon, butter, beans, beef, sugar, coffee, and dried fruits. At first, white miners often puzzled over the Chinese habit of eating ‚Äúgreen gourds and green pumpkins and green squash,‚Äù which they discovered helped the Chinese avoid scurvy. Lacking the vitamin nutrition of fresh vegetables, early white miners were susceptible to scurvy--cases were frequently reported--and they tried to avoid vitamin C deficiencies by eating green onions and potatoes soaked in vinegar or lime juice.19       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Fresh vegetables constituted the dearest of commodities in early mining camps. Despite high prices the Chinese considered them an important part of their diet and solved the problem of scarcity by growing their own. By the early 1850s Chinese gardens had sprung up near every mining or urban center, providing the local community with fresh vegetables. The Virginia City, Nevada, Territorial Enterprise reflected a situation typical of most mining camps when it reported that ‚Äúevery patch of ground cultivated by them [Chinese] is a model of neatness, and they pay such strict attention to the rotation of crops that something is constructively growing in every bed and plot.‚Äù20       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Although Chinese peasants knew how to grow vegetables, natural barriers in the American West posed challenges to agriculture. In the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Sacramento Valley, for example, Chinese gardeners had to learn to grow crops in a land of summer drought and moderate winter rains, while in the northern Rocky Mountains they had to overcome the short June-to-early-September growing season. Guangdong Province, China, in contrast, had a twelve-month growing season and plenty of moisture. Nevertheless, the Chinese adjusted to each new environment accordingly. Using terraced gardens, effective manure, copious irrigation, and careful tending, they harvested vegetables under California‚Äôs semiarid conditions and raised six crops in Idaho‚Äôs short season. On the mining frontier, the Chinese earned a reputation as ‚Äúthe most thorough gardeners in the world.‚Äù Indeed, the term ‚ÄúChinese garden‚Äù became synonymous with freshness and quality. The ‚ÄúGreen Gold‚Äù that Sucheng Chan identified as vegetable gardening gave Chinese miners extra financial power as well as greater physical strength.21       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Proper medical care also sustained Chinese health. Although willing to call on American doctors in emergencies, Chinese miners generally depended on their own physicians for medical care. Traditional Chinese medical practice, based on use of herbal medicines derived from plant, mineral, and animal substances, was far more effective in dealing with chronic disease. Prior to the scientific and pharmaceutical revolutions of the twentieth century, Euramerican medicine shared strong similarity with Chinese medicine in its use of herbs in drugs. But Chinese medicine was more sophisticated. The Chinese, for example, had used molds to cure infection long before the invention of penicillin, and thus saved many lives, particularly in mining areas where injuries and traumas occurred almost daily. Similarly, a compound of whiskey and opium was used to relieve influenza and diarrhea, and Chinese physicians discovered how to use common baking soda to treat a skin infection caused by poison ivy.22       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  The Chinese commercial network regularly distributed imported herbal medicines to distant communities, and every major mining camp had at least one or two resident Chinese doctors, who practiced their native medicine in town and traveled to remote areas to do so as well. Nevada‚Äôs Hop Lock and Idaho‚Äôs Ah Fong were local legends who treated various ailments ‚Äúwithout the use of poisonous medicines.‚Äù Hop Lock‚Äôs newspaper advertisement even boasted that he could ‚Äúcure all diseases on this coast.‚Äù Their success with herbal medicines as well as acupuncture convinced many whites to visit Chinese doctors in search of necessary, not alternative, medical treatment.23       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Together, advanced medical care and a balanced diet contributed to better health and lower mortality rates among the Chinese. Available census data show much lower mortality rates for the Chinese than among whites in almost all western states and territories. In both 1870 and 1880, Chinese mortality rates were only half those for whites in such major mining states and territories as California, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Far more Chinese deaths resulted from accidents or violence than disease, and in 1880, no Chinese deaths at all were reported in Colorado, New Mexico, or Utah, all of which had sizable Chinese populations. Often accused of possessing unsanitary habits and spreading deadly diseases, Chinese in the American West were, on the contrary, much more likely to survive than their white counterparts because of healthier life-styles.24       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  As good as the Chinese were at surviving in a foreign environment, their most exquisite placer mining skills were in aquatic management. For thousands of years China made herself known as a hydraulic society by constructing great water projects. People in China‚Äôs arid north constantly strived to get water onto the land even as people in south China battled seasonal floods. ‚ÄúThe Chinese people,‚Äù declares British historian Joseph Needham, ‚Äúhave been outstanding among the nations of the world in their control and use of water.‚Äù Most of the Chinese came to America from the southeast coast, a tropical area where rice terraces dominated the landscape. Rice growing required water on and of the land at specific times. Thus, Cantonese peasants had acquired a great deal of knowledge about collecting and diverting water before migrating to the New World. As another historian put it, ‚ÄúWater became in China the profoundest symbol for understanding nature, human affairs, and the right principles for governing both.‚Äù In the American West, Chinese immigrants ingeniously converted their agricultural aquatic knowledge and methods to mining.25        ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Chinese sophistication and effectiveness in extracting gold have impressed both contemporary rivals and modern observers. Along rivers and streams, Chinese miners discovered ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù of gold deposits by reading the flow of the eddies. Because many gold deposits in ancient alluvial channels were located on ‚Äúhigh terraces‚Äù above what was then the current water course, miners had to either pump water to higher ground or truck ‚Äúpay dirt‚Äù down to the stream. Chinese miners introduced the Chinese pump, a wooden trough with a chain-pallet system for draining and irrigating rice fields, which could deliver large quantities of water to sluices on higher ground. The Chinese pump soon became a popular device in western mining. At other times, the Chinese simply used wheelbarrows to carry gold-bearing soil down to the river banks, but they never wasted water. Indeed, they knew how to conserve one natural resource to exploit another. In Stevens County, Washington, for example, Chinese miners collected precious water from farmers‚Äô waste ditches and conveyed it to their claims.26       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Numerous contemporary observers noted how Chinese mining sites were usually well organized. Stones and boulders were neatly stacked, and operations were systematic and tidy in appearance. As one observer noted, ‚ÄúThe Chinese excelled at saving gold, especially fine gold, under difficult conditions.‚Äù Chinese miners sometimes installed an iron grate in the sluice to catch round boulders suitable for pavement, thus turning waste material into extra pro√ût.27 Contemporary Americans well acknowledged this Chinese talent, and often hired Chinese to work on water projects in many mining areas. In 1856, John Reese, a Latter-day Saint who planned to erect a settlement in Nevada, recruited about fifty Chinese from California to build a ditch to bring water from the Carson River to Gold Canyon, thus initiating Chinese entry to the territory.28 Even Mormons, with their reputation for developing superb irrigation systems, admired Chinese skill in water management.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Randall Rohe‚Äôs study of Chinese river mining captures the essence of their water management.29 California‚Äôs distinctive annual summer drought prevented prospectors from tapping the region‚Äôs rich gold deposits. River mining provided the answer. To nineteenth-century standards, river mining was usually a huge operation, requiring the construction of a system of dams, flumes, canals, tunnels, derricks, and pumps. Riverbeds had to be drained each season. A big site could cover an entire valley or basin for many miles. Chinese waterwheels turned pumps to either drain the sites efficiently or lift water to higher ground quickly. Water-powered derricks could hoist rocks weighing more than twenty tons. When Euramerican companies sustained heavy losses in the early years due to uncooperative weather, Chinese miners realized greater success because of their superior water projects. A State Journal correspondent from Weaverville, California, said of the Chinese-built flumes ‚Äúin point of workmanship, durability and fitness for the purpose intended, [they are] better than any ever before placed in the river.‚Äù Another writer praised the Chinese water project near Orleans Bar for exhibiting ‚Äúgreat ingenuity as well as labor and strength.‚Äù30       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  By the mid-1850s the Chinese dominated California river mining, and by the 1880s they achieved perfection. Some of their successes were astonishing. Mining near Honolulu on the Klamath River, a group of twelve to eighteen Chinese were said to have extracted $5,000 to $10,000 worth of gold a day, and a total of $140,000 in 1890-1891. Masterful in aquatic technology and adept at river mining, the Chinese often succeeded where others failed.31       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Many western mining areas depended on the presence of Chinese miners and their exclusive skills for their longevity. No place illustrates this better than the 200-square-mile area known as Boise Basin, Idaho. After the discovery of gold there in 1862 and the stampede in 1863, the population of Boise Basin, located forty miles northeast of Boise, exploded to 14,910 on nine thousand claims. Bannock (later Idaho City) with 6,275 residents surpassed Portland to become the largest city in the Pacific Northwest.32 From the beginning of the rush, Boise Basin struggled to meet the population‚Äôs demand for water. A contemporary reporter thought the local water supply could accommodate only four thousand miners, allowing for only ten weeks of mining each year.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  By 1864, only the second season of mining, the flight of white miners had begun, and the bust, often endemic to such places, seemed close at hand. Hoping to revive the local economy, Boise County civic leaders sent an agent to California to recruit Chinese. From 1865 to 1869, the depletion of the white population combined with the influx of Chinese immigrants resulted in an unusual demographic shift. In 1870, of Boise Basin‚Äôs 3,528 residents, 1,740, 49 percent of the population, were Chinese. Ninety-two percent of them worked on mining claims, compared to about 60 percent of the white populace. The presence of Chinese had created a new mining boom, one that lasted for three decades.33       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Because they missed the initial rush of 1862√ê1863 and found little ‚Äúfree ground,‚Äù early Chinese pioneers to Boise Basin had to purchase mining claims from white owners, who worked out the initial gold, sold the claim, and left for new diggings. Often presenting themselves at the right place at the right time, Chinese miners took advantage of low prices. More important was the Chinese buyers‚Äô insistence on acquiring water rights with their mining claims. Most transactions specified water rights. An 1872 deed recorded that Wang Yet, Ah Lang, Wan Hay & Co. paid John Carrol and James Norton $1,800 for ‚Äúfour ditches and water rights taking all of the water of Sugar Creek and tributaries, on northwest side of Grimes Creek with two reservoirs.‚Äù34 The Chinese soon demonstrated their expertise in constructing water ditches, flumes, and reservoirs in the basin, and built several hundred miles of water ditches and flumes during their years in the basin.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Because they had good water systems, the Chinese companies could begin mining earlier in the season. In early April 1874, for example, when others still awaited the spring runoff, the Silver City, Idaho, Owyhee Avalanche reported enviously, ‚Äúthe Buena Vista Bar Company have got water through a portion of their ditches this week, and some companies of Chinese on the Bar have commenced work.‚Äù35 Careful management of limited water resources enabled the Chinese to extend the mining season and thus enhance their profits. Chinese miners commonly mined from early April to late October, and in 1877 a Chinese company reportedly started washing in mid-February.36       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  With unique methods and water skills, the Chinese often made significant profits from claims no longer attractive to others. In 1876, the Idaho World reported that ‚Äúa party of Chinamen, mining on North Elk, a short distance above town, the other day cleaned up six thousand dollars, after a run of only twenty-four days.‚Äù The same year, the Idaho Statesman reported that on Ophir Creek, ‚Äúa large Chinese company own a claim for which they paid $8,000 three years ago. The same property could not now be bought for $20,000.‚Äù37 How did a mining claim increase its value after two years of extensive extraction? The answer was that the claim‚Äôs Chinese owners had brought water to the property, thus making it possible to gather more gold from it. Because of their skills in aquatic management, the Chinese often turned dry claims into rich grounds. In 1863, with a population of 14,910 and no Chinese miners, Boise Basin yielded 150,000 ounces of gold, an average of 10 ounces per person. By 1870, when the Chinese dominated basin placer mining, 3,528 residents produced 135,000 ounces of gold, or about 38.3 ounces per person. Such statistics underscore Chinese efficiency.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Unlike many western boom-and-bust camps that survived only a few seasons, Boise Basin continued as a gold mining center for nearly one hundred years--to the middle of the twentieth century. The Chinese stayed for several decades but left in the early 1900s. The shift from placer to lode mining, the second phase of gold production, began in the 1880s and had direct effects on the local Chinese. As noted, lode mining required substantial capital for heavy equipment and stamp mills, but it did not depend on large supplies of water nor on Chinese aquatic expertise. Moreover, rock shafts were more expensive than water ditches, and as large corporations invaded the basin, industrial mining forced individual miners out of business.38       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Faced with this transition, the Chinese had to decide whether to invest in lode mining. Most of those not wanting to stay in the United States permanently left the area quietly, some later settling in such urban areas as Boise, Seattle, and San Francisco. By 1910 only a handful of Chinese elders still mined along basin streams, but their presence lengthened the life span of placer mining in Boise Basin.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Although most Chinese did not embrace lode mining, they were highly adaptive in other ways, including dwelling construction in frontier environments, a skill that provided them an advantage. The diversity of Chinese habitations at various mining areas indicated their flexibility. Abundance of timber in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevadas offered the Chinese a natural gift they were not accustomed to in the overcrowded motherland. In China timber was scarce, but in timber-rich southwestern Idaho the Chinese built log cabins and saltbox structures that were wholly unfamiliar to them previously. No Oriental-style structure such as rice- or hay-stalk shanties ever appears to have been built in any of the region‚Äôs mining camps.39       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  In timber-scarce areas such as the lower Salmon River in central Idaho, the Chinese built shelters in a variety of ways to meet their needs. Because most of the canyon region was covered by grass and basalt, rock shelters were popular. Rock walls were often built above a rectangular pit, and dirt piled against the outside of the walls for support and insulation. If basalt was not available, the Chinese simply constructed mud houses or dugouts. Techniques associated with earth construction, common in many parts of China due to the scarcity of timber, greatly enhanced the Chinese pioneers‚Äô chance of surviving in treeless areas. Built to last, some of the rock shelters and mud houses were reoccupied by white residents as late as the twentieth century. Archaeological studies show a variety of Chinese dwellings in the nineteenth-century American West. In the Southwest, they preferred to live in either adobe houses or dugouts. In Virginia City, Nevada, where in early years the price of brick and wood was exorbitant, the Chinese filled oil cans with stones and dirt and stacked them up as walls, creating buildings that were both fireproof and bulletproof. Some Chinese simply dug caves into the hillsides for new homes.40       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  In addition to mining, the Chinese exploited other natural resources by logging, fishing, and hunting and thus further maximized economic gains. In forested areas during the idle season of mining--the cold of winter or the dry summers--many Chinese cut trees to provide the local community with firewood or building material. In fall 1881, for example, the Idaho Statesman reported that a group of Chinese near Silverman‚Äôs ranch ‚Äúhad cleaned up their sluices for the season and were now engaged in chopping a thousand cords of wood for parties in Boise. It will be floated down and caught in a boom at the city whenever the streams begin to rise.‚Äù In another instance, twenty Chinese were observed trying to float four thousand cords of timber from Boise Basin to Boise City, a distance of forty miles. During winter the Chinese in Virginia City, Nevada, dominated the wood retail business after displacing Paiute Indian woodcutters.41       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Winter hunting also could help offset the cost of living. In late 1870, while many whites were leaving Loon Creek in northeastern Idaho for the winter, seventy-five Chinese and a few others went into the nearby mountains and hunted mountain sheep for fresh meat. One traveler saw ‚Äú750 pounds of the meat brought into town by one party.‚Äù42 In the Warren Mining District in central Idaho and along the Salmon River and its tributaries, the Chinese fished extensively, often catching salmon, steelhead, trout, and whitefish, and supplying the local community and themselves with freshwater fish. In a more efficient and destructive fishing method, the Chinese often set off explosives in streams or ponds. Once, ‚Äúa Chinese had both hands blown off, trying to kill salmon with giant powder at Camas on the South Fork of the Salmon River.‚Äù43 As in placer mining, the Chinese searched every gulch and hill for their economic improvement. Exploitation of local resources maximized profits for energetic miners and helped marginal prospectors survive in an otherwise unstable industry.       The more adaptable the Chinese were to their environment, the more efficient Chinese placer mining was, but it also heightened environmental destruction. Placer mining typically caused violent reconfiguration of the landscape, including large-scale deforestation and soil erosion. In Tuscarora, Nevada, where timber was scarce, the Chinese cut sagebrush on the desert and hauled it by wagon to the local mines. By 1881, the Tuscarora area, scoured fifteen to twenty miles distant for fuel wood, was cleared of sagebrush completely.44       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Hydraulic and river mining, the more intense techniques of placer mining, literally moved hills and rivers. After operations ceased, waste tailings covered huge areas, and revegetation took years. In 1897, after more than three decades of heavy mining, the United States Geological Survey team documented the environmental impact of mining in Boise Basin. The Mores Creek, it said, ‚Äúis filled with coarse gravel, largely made up of tailings brought down from the Idaho [Boise] Basin by the winter freshets. The maximum depth of these tailings is 20 feet. The gravels in the present stream have been and are still extensively washed, mostly by Chinese using the ordinary appliances for river mining--dams, Chinese pumps, and derricks.‚Äù45 In 1906, J. P. Hutchins, a mining consultant and engineer, said land in the West had already been ruined by previous mining, mostly by Chinese. Its racist overtone notwithstanding, the statement contains truth.46 Even today, the numerous, large-scale tailings remain visible scars on the western landscape.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  The story of nineteenth-century western mining has justifiably increased our interest in the relationship among the Chinese settler, placer mining, and western environment. Chinese society has traditionally been viewed as subscribing to the harmony of mankind and nature. The Chinese spent more than two thousand years pursuing such a harmony and developed a consciousness of nature‚Äôs beauty much earlier than Europeans. Even with a strong appreciation of natural beauty, however, Chinese miners in the West could not resist the temptation of economic gain and personal profit. In nineteenth-century America, Chinese immigrants in the remote wilderness and under harsh conditions made persistent efforts to survive in a strange land and to increase personal wealth. Their ability to adapt quickly to local conditions and live efficiently off the land became an invaluable asset in competing with others for survival. As historian Xi Wang notes, ‚ÄúUnlike European immigrants, who migrated to America not only to pursue their fortunes but also for religious freedom, cultural identity, and political refuge, the Chinese came to the United States for the single purpose of seeking better economic opportunities.‚Äù47 Assuming their stay in a foreign country was temporary, they worried little about the future of the place and mercilessly exploited the West‚Äôs natural resources. The Chinese proved extremely successful at it. Hardly the pitiful victims depicted so often, they acted as destroyers, exploiters, and conquerors of the American West much like Anglos and other miners.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Western mining provides a useful means for considering Chinese relations with the American environment. The Chinese are acknowledged for helping change the western landscape. They are congratulated for making positive or at least nonnegative contributions such as reclamation of a million acres in California and the introduction of plant species to America. In fact, hundreds of thousands of Asian immigrants also helped deface the western landscape. Their particular skills in mining allowed them to maximize exploitation. As historian Patricia Nelson Limerick asked: ‚ÄúIf environmental history has now redefined much of this rearranging of the American landscape as disruption and injury, how do we appraise the Chinese 'contribution‚Äô to that disruption?‚Äù48 Certainly, further investigation is needed, but the historical irony is that people with a strong environmental consciousness can sometimes cause greater environmental damage. For the Chinese at least, greater efficiency meant greater destruction.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  As a story of economic mobility and self-improvement, the Chinese experience on the western mining frontier was a success. To be sure, the Chinese had many disadvantages. They possessed little starting capital, they had staked no initial claims, they faced legal discrimination, and they encountered racial violence. But these disadvantages were often compensated for by advantages, including mining experience, cooperative culture, a healthy life-style, skill at aquatic management, and environmental adaptability, all of which ensured Chinese competitiveness in the American West. In 1870, several Chinese companies in Montana were listed among the territory‚Äôs most profitable. For six months Chang-Ling Company with seven persons cleared $13,000 in gold. According to one 1871 account, Chinese miners took out $500,000 in gold from the Tuscarora region in Nevada. Between 1855 and 1870 more than 10 percent of the gold and silver exports through the Port of San Francisco went to China, an amount ($72,581,219) equivalent to more than $1 billion today.49       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  Because of their collective success in placer mining, some Chinese became rags-to-riches legends. For example, after four decades of hard work, Loke Kee of Boise Basin accumulated a fortune estimated between $60,000 and $90,000. Many people, including whites, envied his personal wealth. In fall 1857 a Chinese merchant without hesitation offered $200,000 for a mining claim near Oroville, California. The Sacramento Union claimed, ‚ÄúSome of these Chinamen are immensely wealthy and are very fond of making big speculations, but generally wait to see a pretty 'dead thing‚Äô before investing their money.‚Äù50 Although the Chinese missed all the major gold rushes and excitements, they eventually had a monopoly in placer mining and enjoyed success in the American West. It is a phenomenon worthy of further investigation. The relationship of the Chinese to western mining contains hidden treasures, but at present no phrase depicts the theme of this great but little acclaimed frontier drama more properly than does ‚Äúno need to rush.‚Äù  ¬†         LIPING ZHU is assistant professor of history, Eastern Washington University, Cheney, and a member of the editorial board for the Western Historical Quarterly.

GX079-39-3383923	For Immediate Release   ¬†   Contact:¬† John B. Townsend II, Communications Director       February 06, 2003     (202) 225-8885     ¬†       Floor Statement     ¬†                   A TRIBUTE TO BOOKER T. WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL           ¬†     ¬†               By U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas)      Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring an educational success story within the Dallas Independent School District. The Booker T. Washington High School was built in 1922 as the first African American high school in Dallas. For the past 81 years, Booker T. Washington High School has provided hundreds of central city youngsters with an academic foundation that has allowed them to reach their potential.   ¬†   The school's story began in 1922 with the dream of an African-American-owned school emphasizing the basics through creative instructional programs, coupled with a strong multicultural development. The school's success story can be attributed to incredible commitment on the part of the school's parents, administrators, and teachers because of their love for kids and crafts.   ¬†   The Booker T. Washington High School, after gallery space and studios were added in 1976, was designated as the arts ``magnet'' high school. Since its inception, Booker T. Washington High School has received national acclaim as a prototype for subsequent magnet schools throughout the United States and Canada.   ¬†   The Booker T. Washington High School community has pulled together for the children of Dallas's central city. The school currently serves over 700 students from 66 different zip codes in grades 9 through 12. All students are selected through auditions, interviews, portfolios, or other demonstration of artistic and academic aptitudes.   ¬†   Booker T. Washington High School students distinguish themselves by receiving a variety of prestigious awards and honors including thirteen Presidential Scholar Awards--the nation's highest accolade for excellence in arts and academics.   ¬†   On average, 163 graduating seniors boast $5 million in college scholarship offers both in arts and academic majors. Noted graduates include Grammy winners such as R & B vocalist Erykah Badu, jazz trumpeter Roy Hargove, singer Norah Jones, dancer Jay Franke, cellist John Koen, visual artists Christian Schumann and Chris Arnold, drummer Aaron Comess, Edie Brickell of the New Bohemians, and members of the gospel group God's Property.   ¬†   Booker T. Washington High School, a pride of our community, has been a success story because of its distinguished faculty. The instructional staff consists of 60 full time teachers and 24 part-time teachers and consultants. Approximately 83 percent of the faculty has advance degrees and 88 percent have more than 10 years of teaching experience.    ¬†   Booker T.

GX021-40-2350095	"Theres always something new in the past.   The historical record differs depending on who looks back and what questions they ask.  All scholars limit their gaze; those who concentrate on medical history are interested in how healers have cared for the wounded and sick at various times.  These medical historians talk about the practices of healers from the past, in part just to ""know"" and also to inspire contemporary doctors to be humane and compassionate; their writings, teachings, and research can influence and shape politics.  This article is based on an exhibit about medical historians that is on display at the National Library of Medicine (1).   In the nineteenth century, warring groups of medical practitioners vied with each other to attract patients, promoted different types of therapies, and glorified their own practices.  They often ridiculed the practices of the others, pointing out their shortcomings.     ""Hydropaths"" advocated ""Water Cures"" and ""Rain Baths."" Their philosophy was that water was crucial for purifying and invigorating the body.  ""Thomsonians,"" named for their founder Samuel Thomson, emphasized the natural capacity of the body to heal itself. They recommended that patients use herbal or ""vegetable"" medicines extracted from common plants. ""Homeopaths"" believed that ""like cures like."" They gave their patients tiny amounts of drugs that produced the same symptoms that the illness itself produced.  ""Allopaths"" treated patients with remedies that counteracted the symptoms for which they were prescribed, much as doctors do today.         By the turn of the century, the allopaths had largely triumphed in the war among the camps.  They used advanced scientific methods, which gave them credibility that the other groups lacked.  And they had a strong organization, the American Medical Association, which they founded in 1847.   But some doctors worried that, with this new emphasis on science, the humanistic side of medicine would be lost.     Sir William Osler, for example, a doctor and professor at Johns Hopkins University, tried to meld the new scientific approach with the older concern for humanity.  Osler was known for his ""careful observation of the sick person, who saw him as a friend even while being the subject of a most intense scrutiny (2).""     Another doctor who brought the lessons of history into his practice and teachings was Henry Sigerist.  Sigerist was a doctor and historian at Johns Hopkins University from 1932 to 1947.  He gave speeches all over North America, emphasizing that ""we study the history of science...because we need a broad scientist who is not a mere technician but is prepared to take an active part in the general life of the community....Science alone is useless as long as it is not integrated into the pattern of our social and economic life (3).""        Sigerist questioned the traditional organization of private medical practice and offered proposals for ""socialized medicine"" that would make medical care equal and available for everybody.  He was dynamic and influential and even appeared in 1939 on the cover of Time magazine -- an honor no other medical historian has received so far.   Sigerists position on the importance of medical history to medicine was that ""medical history teaches us where we come from, where we stand in medicine at the present time, and in what direction we are marching.  It is the compass that guides us into the future (4).""    Medical historian Theodore  Brown says that, since the 1960s, many historians of medicine have been ""resurrecting the spirit of Sigerist.""  They have been trying to make history ""relevant to the people and to pressing contemporary social issues and problems.""   For example, in 1981, historian James Jones published the book  Bad Blood .  It documented how, from 1932 to 1972, doctors in the U.S. Public Health Service conducted unethical experiments on African-American men in Tuskegee, Alabama who had syphilis. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, newspaper and magazine articles and television documentaries popularized the story that Jones recounted in  Bad Blood .  Dr. Vanessa Gamble, a physician and historian at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, led a campaign during this time to pressure the government to apologize to the men who had been in the Tuskegee syphilis study and their families.  Finally, on May 16, 1997, President Clinton apologized on behalf of the U.S. government.   Two other books by medical historians --  Deadly Dust  and  Dying for Work  -- prompted the federal government to pass laws in the 1990s to protect workers from job-related hazards.  The books by David Rosner and Gerald Markowitz directed public attention to problems that confront sand blasters.  Sand blast workers breathe dust from sand particles that are emitted in the blasting process.  They can develop silicosis, a disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease, and they were not routinely warned of their risk.  As a result of these books, the sand blast industry is now required by law to warn workers fully about health hazards they may encounter at the workplace.   Early in the twentieth century, a medical historian wrote that  ""if a distinct place were assigned to medical history in the medical curriculum it could...form one of the most useful and inspiring features in the whole scheme of medical education (5).""  Now, late in the century, many medical schools have added historical study to their curriculums, acknowledging that history has much to contribute to the contemporary medical scene.        1. The exhibit, ""So, whats new in the past?:  The Multiple Meanings of Medical History,"" is on display at the National Library of Medicine on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland through September 30, 1997.   2.
