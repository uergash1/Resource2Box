In this article, the author states that environmentalists are attacking Starbucks because it is a successful capitalist company. The first argument against Starbucks is that it buys “Not Fair Trade Coffee”. It means that it pays a very low price for its coffee that makes plantation workers to live in a poor condition. The second argument environmentalists used, is that Starbucks uses not organic milk for its latte. According to them the processed milk is related with cancer and is unhealthy. The third reason why greens attack Starbucks is that it uses genetically engineered products. However, the author thinks that Starbucks managers commit a mistake accepting the environmentalists’ demands because they are supported by inexact information and lies. I think that environmentalists are looking for a healthier life and enterprises that accept their requirements show their interest in human wealth. In this Starbucks example, the manager introduced some changes in their products because they were compatible with company’s values. Hence, the improvements they made should be accepted for their clients. However, I don’t agree with environmentalists to pressure an enterprise to sale only not genetically engineered products, because is the customer who should decide what does he want to buy and at what price.

After that, they decided to bring a good quality of coffee, because in the past the U.S. had awful coffee. They went to Europe to buy dark coffee which was very different from American coffee. They have began to open coffee shops in Seattle. Finally, Starbucks became very a popular coffee shop in the world and it now has 5,689 outlets in 28 countries. In my opinion, life has a lot of chances, but some people do not get them and some people get them like the Starbucks' owners. It was very a good idea to start a business with friends and to share with them information and experience. Also, any businesses now need money to start and they handle this problem by making business with three friends. Now, Starbucks has delicious coffee, and high quality coffee. Finally they have nice service and a popular coffee shop.

clueweb09-en0003-05-05751	"                    State 29         Keeping Track Of All Those Iowa Scandals While Remaining Insightfully Vulgar                         Saturday, June 21, 2008         Million Dollar Ripoff         From the Des Moines Register : A grocery industry group says a program that allows welfare recipients to shop at Iowa farmers markets with food stamps has cost taxpayers nearly $1 million over three years for less than $60,000 worth of fresh food. State officials acknowledge the numbers, but they say the cost also reflects indirect efforts to promote the entire food stamp program used by more than 255,000 people statewide. The issue about the farmers market costs arose from a disagreement over the state's effort to end a separate 7-cent subsidy grocers receive each time an electronic food stamp card is used. Iowa Department of Human Services officials have said the grocer subsidy, worth about $1 million per year, could be better spent. Right.  The Iowa Department of Human Services clearly wants to take that million dollars is pays to grocery stores for processing food stamps on their behalf and instead burn  even more money  ""marketing"" farmer's markets to people on food stamps. What a waste. State government in Iowa needs to be weeded.  No, it needs to be  destroyed .  Get the Roundup and start spraying.  Start with DHS.

Some men do not have birth locations listed because they registered on  the final draft registration day in 1918 when this information was not  recorded. Almost 24 million men registered for the draft -- not always  in the county of residence.

When our hair looks good, we feel good about ourselves. We spend a lot of time and money on our hair in order for it to look the way we want it to. Unfortunately for many of us that means spending a lot more time and money on our hair then others because it isn't naturally thick. I myself have thin hair and because of that I have to keep my hair short or else it looks thin and raggedy. There are some great products like  nioxin  that can help with this though. Nioxin is a great product that thickens your hair and nourishes your hair and scalp making it look and feel a lot more thicker. You can find Nioxin and other great products from Hello-Gorgeous.net. This is a great website for women. They carry a wide variety of wonderful haircare products, skincare products, make-up, bath products as well as  many other wonderful products. They have really good prices and the top products out there. Hello-Gorgeous.net will definitely help to you look and feel more gorgeous and isn't that what every women wants.

I'm exhausted! I went to bed early last night, or at least I tried to, but my little guy kept waking up in the night crying. It took a while to get him back to sleep so I didn't get much sleep last night. When I got up this morning I spilled my coffee on my computer desk when I sat in my computer chair because evidently it broke last night when my daughter was using the computer, but forgot to tell me. Sigh, I am so going to be lots of coffee today. So anyone know where the best place to buy  office furniture   is because I need a new computer chair now.

OOPS -- NEVER MIND.                    ....                      POLITICAL HUMOR       SONG PARODIES      FOOD & DRINK HUMOR      LEGAL HUMOR        It's hard to follow the news lately without reading some scientific red alert about an everyday food.   Not long ago, for instance, The Center for Science in the Public Interest announced that pastries are bad for you.  All I can say is: Exactly -- that's why we eat them.   Actually, I lied; I have much more to say.  For one thing, I'd like to know whether scientists think we're altogether stupid.  Do they really suppose that anyone believes butter-packed, nut-filled, sugar-loaded dessert items are good for us?  Or that anybody has ever plucked a cheese-oozing, sugar-coated bonbon of a pastry off the bakery counter while saying, ""Yum, this looks low-cal.  I'll bet if I eat three of them right now, my cholesterol count will plunge 60 points by tomorrow.""   I'm operating under a handicap here -- I personally have never conducted a scientific survey.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to say with utter confidence, that 99.999999999999 percent of the population (give or take a 5 percent margin of error) is well aware of pastries' artery-clogging proclivities.  This is a direct corollary to the ""Tasty No-No"" rule: Anything that tastes good will kill you.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but, well, you've got the picture.   We've all digested more than enough goodies ... and studies, to be aware of the danger of desserts.  And we're aggravated quite enough, thank you very much.  So scientists can stop alarming us now and move on to something useful.  How about developing a scrumptious dessert that   won't   kill us?   When researchers aren't telling us stuff we already know, they're touting the result of some study that contradicts a study from the previous month.  Why do scientists get to say ""never mind"" whenever they feel like it?   When lawyers are wrong, they're sued for malpractice.  When writers are wrong, they're sued for libel.  When politicians are wrong, they ... um ... well ... bad example.     So tell me; Which study is right?  Are beta carotene/vitamin E/alcohol good for you or bad?   What about sugar and fat substitutes, margarine versus butter, oat bran versus wheat? What weight, cholesterol level, exercise amount and type is right for whom, and how come the rules change every other day?   Most of us paid attention to scientists at first.  We replaced our Paba-less sun-screen when they cautioned only Paba would do.   We didn't even complain when they reversed themselves; instead, we searched for labels bragging ""Paba-free!""   We were just as compliant with coffee, switching from caff to decaf, only to learn that the decaffing chemicals may be (or may not be) even worse for our health.   So we switched once more to water processed, only to find out caffeine fights depression. Frankly, that depressed me.   I think it's time for a health advisory hiatus.  Scientists can study wine or butter or bran for a bit.  After that, they can study it again and again  ... and again.  Then, when they're absolutely certain, they have my permission to scare us to death.   From now on when a headline proclaims the outcome of some study, I will close my eyes and turn the page.  And tonight, to celebrate my decision, I'm going to dine on one of those dangerous Italian/Chinese/Mexican meals.  I may even top it off with movie popcorn and a pecan pastry.     I'm feeling better already.        © Madeleine Begun Kane.

Then Willow offered to interview anyone who left 'interview' in their comment. Being shy and retiring, I did. In fact that may have been my comment. She sent me the following questions to answer .. 1.  If you called me on the phone, could I immediately recognize your New York accent?   I do not have a NewYawk accent.  I am not from Brooklyn, Queens or Longuyland.  I grew up in da Bronx but have lived more of my life in Manhattan.  So, no you would not recognize my 'accent' but you'd know it was me by caller ID or just my fashionable attitude.       2.  Your photos are wonderful.  Thank you.   How did you get your start in photography and what kind of camera do you use?   I started taking photos was because I couldn't paint what I saw the way I saw it.   I wanted my paintings to be perfect replicas of what I was seeing but I was not talented enough.  At some point I realized I was able to do that with a camera and so I do.  I use an Olympus Stylus 720SW .. which BTW I thought I lost last night .. I am happy to report I found it in my desk at the office although I have no idea how it got there (it likely fell out of my bag into the drawer).       3.  It's intriguing that you are a vegetarian, and yet don't cook much.  I don't cook at all if I can help it.  I did cook, a lot, when we were first married.  I cooked, I baked, I was  such  a wife . Do you eat a lot of takeout?   I do.  I often bring home something from the office cafeteria or stop to pick up something on the way home from the office.  I am lucky that we live between Zabars and Fairway . What is your favorite?    Zabar's tuna salad on their amazing seeded rye bread.         4.  What is your greatest regret?  Ah .. well .. there are a few ... but I think the biggest is - this is a hard question, Willow - okay.  I am sorry that I wasnt there when my dad died .       5.  What is your motto?   Umm ...  be prepared           Here's the directions:       1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""  2. I will respond by emailing you five questions. (I get to pick the    questions).   3. You will update your blog with the answers to the questions.   4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview    someone else in the same post.   5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.             26 Bus Stops        Labels:  comments ,  fun. ,  interview ,  questions ,  willow                                         my sky             condominiums.  more like condo maximums in this joint O'Neill Building  - Sixth Avenue in the Twenties for more skies, visit Sandy Carlson, IMac, Klaus, Wren, Ivar & Fishing Guy at  Sky Command  Center!             27 Bus Stops        Labels:  gold dome. ,  my sky ,  Sixth Avenue at 23 St. ,  sky watch friday                                         things i have done             Saw this over at Akelamaku's blog   Everything and Nothing.

We are witnessing history at this moment. Enough said. Date: Thu, 3 Jan 2008 22:25:58 -0500 From:  Me To: Me Subject: Primary Results - My thoughts I haven't sent out one of my voting emails in a while. But, tonight, it feels appropriate I am thinking about my grandmother and what she would think if she were alive today. When she died, my mom went through a lot of her papers and found some voting slips from the 40's and 50's. See, my grandmother voted in a time when Black people weren't supposed to. She wasn't highly educated or upper class. She was a maid, she caught the bus to the River Oaks area every day and worked in a white woman's kitchen. Voting was important enough to her that she was willing to PAY to exercise her right to vote. Poll taxes were 2.50 and she earned about 5.50 a day at the time. It is because of her that I will never take my right to vote for granted. I think she's get a kick out of tonight's results. So, I don't care which candidate or party you support... please, support something. Be a part of the political process!

She kept a list of all the books she read in 2007 and shared the list with us. The Original Old Girl has an ecletic list. A little mystery, sci-fi, Christian lit, contemporary fiction... some good stuff. That posted made me pause. I read a LOT, but I have never taken the time to review what I've read in any given period. So while I compose my own list, what do you think? What did you read last year? Last month even. Check back this weekend for BlackLiterature's Great Book List 2007.

I know. This blog doesn't get updated that often. That doesn't mean I've stopped reading. Lately, I've been wondering what's happened to some of my favorite authors. I thought I would throw the question out to the group. If you know, please share. BarbaraNeely:  The Blanche White series.  All I need to say is that I love this woman.  Blanche is Black, sassy and determined. By the looks of her website, BarbaraNeely has a LOT of fans who would love to catch up with Blanche White. Check out  BarbaraNeely's  website for more info.  Gar Anthony Haywood:  Author of the Aaron Gunner series and the Loudermilk mysteries. The Loudermilks are retirees cruising the country in their recreational vehice. Joe and Dottie always get their man. Gunner is a LA private eye in an urban, gritty sense. Valerie Wilson Wesley:   Tamara Haye was The female super sleuth in the mid-nineties. Smart, feminine, cool. It's good to see that she is still around. I would like to know what's happened to Penny Mickelbury, Pamela Thomas-Graham and Eleanor Taylor Bland.

This book of poetry is broken into sections Evil and Love, Haiku, Thinking, Sistahs, and Poetry for Poets.  This is not your typical coffeehouse spoken word poetry. Enjoy! Product Description Writing poems and keeping journal since 1991, Jill Scott now shares her personal poetry collection in The Moments, the Minutes, the Hours. Praised for her earthy, honestly erotic, soulful and very real lyrics, Jill Scott explores all the flavors of life, love, and self.  Of her music, Jill offers: ""It's music. It's experiences. It's vulnerability. It's honesty. It's being a woman---an African American woman. Being a daughter, a sister, a grandchild and a Godmother. It's life. It's deeper than what I know. It's bigger than what I can see. I guess it's a dive into the human spirit."" And the same will come forth in this never- before-seen collection of her poetry.

For Josephine Evans, home was on the stages of the world where she spent thirty years establishing herself as one of the finest actresses of her generation. She had a perfect life and enough sense to live it to the hilt, but then a war she didn’t fully understand turned everything upside down, thrusting her into a role she never wanted and was not prepared to play. Suddenly the target of angry protests aimed at the country she had never really felt was her own, Josephine is forced to return to America to see if she can create a new definition of home. Josephine struggles to reclaim her old life even as she scrambles to shape her new one. Hoping her friend Howard Denmond is as good as his word when he promises to engineer her triumphant return to the European stage, Josephine sets out to increase her nest egg by selling the house her mother willed her, only to find the long-neglected property has become home to squatters who have no intention of leaving. But an unexpected reunion with an old friend offers Josephine a chance to set things right. As unscrupulous land developer gets serious about her plan to tear the community apart, Josephine finds herself playing the most important role of her life, showing her neighbors what courage really is and learning the true meaning of coming home.

PLEASE go take a photo of two of that place before you go out tonight. Please go have at least one beer for a nostalgic turd.  I'm stuck in Iowa until I go back to Savannah for New Year's, and the news makes me truly sad this morning.  I know it's been a chach bar in recent years, and the shows have turned terrible, but that place holds so many valuable memories for me, it just breaks my heart to think that it won't be there.  Bob Dylan slept in the apartments upstairs during a stopover in Columbus in the old days. They have a dusty dead bowling alley hidden in the basement. They still have a hidden drawer in the middle booths that was used for drug drops in the 60's. The most beautiful, wonderful girls that I have loved (and lost) in my young adult life spent hours listening to me talk, bitch, and swill there. So much of my life has blossomed from those rotten green walls, surviving the ocean of smoke clinging to wood scarred with the names of previous survivors. I totally scored pot over-the-table from a member of Tree of Snakes there once, and remember walking out thinking ""What just happened? I love this bar."" Countless in-store performances at Used Kids were adjoined by a token pilgrimage to Larry's, especially running over to catch Cavs playoff scores. I once saw Fern race Russ Fink in the back parking lot, and smoke my guitar player with legs that spun with cartoon fury. A blur of Stapler shows. Discovering Terribly Empty Pockets, despite the dog-shit P.A. So many memories, turned into  tacos .  ALSO: I will give $100 to anybody who steals that drug drawer for me, or confiscates it in the name of Chateau Awesome.

So, yeah, big thank yous to Lou, Dusty (and the rest of the Summit staff), James Wagner, the sponsors, the players, and everyone of you who packed that place with happy faces even though it was super cold and slippery outside.  Inside it was another magical night of cookies, chilis, beers, hot riffage, cool melodies and community spirit - which I know some of you may find cheesy, but those who get it, get it and those who dont, thats cool, too.  We raised a very nice chunk of money for EROC -  checkem out here  and dont be afraid to message them if you want to help and/or get involved.  Next year will be year five for the Rock Potluck and we already have some big, fun ideas in mind for taking it to the next level.  So, until then, thanks again to everyone who played a part in making this years Rock Potluck a resounding success - this event never fails to make me proud of all the awesome people and talented individuals who call Columbus home. Oh, and if you feel like sharing any pictures or videos you might have taken on Saturday night, please PM me and well get them posted to the website.

I liked the pickleknifeydonkey.com    Oh and RaisuUzarachi, if you want ""good art"" go and read your hentai manga, white ninja is the best of the modern ""HUH?!"" time comics, were the humour comes from the lack of any sense or logic to whats going on. Posted on 9/10/2008 1:34:29 AM Onodera Kingmonkey: I concur. Wallsy is never saticified. I see him as a cronic whiner. What the Republicans call, and American. He must be some sort of comedy great or a director of great comedy videos. Posted on 9/9/2008 7:33:14 AM gormster kcornwell, you are a gentleman and a scholar.

One day he came round and asked her to come closer! As she sat by him her husbands eyes full of tears whispered: You′ve been with me through the bad times. When I got tired you supported me. When my business failed you were  there for me. When we lost the house you still stayed. When my health started to fail you were still by my side.  Do you know what! - What, my dear she gently replied smiling as her heart began to fill with warmth.    I think you′re bad luck the husband replied, why don′t you just get lost!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A man gets blind drunk one night and is sick all down his shirt. On no he says, my wife is going to kill me.  Don′t worry his mate replies. Just stick a 20 note in your pocket and tell her someone threw up all over you and  slipped a 20 in your pocket for the dry cleaning bill.    So the men carry on drinking and get even drunker. Eventually, the first man gets home and his wife starts to nag.  You reek of alcohol and you′ve been sick all over yourself. Speaking very carefully, so as not to slur, the man says  I can explain everything dear. This drunken bloke vomited all over me and gave me a slipped a 20 note to cover the  cleaning bill.     His wife looks in his shirt pocket, but there are two notes here that′s 40? Yeah the man replied he peed in my pants too?    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A drunk telephones the Police to report that thieves have broken into his car.     They′ve stolen the dashboard, steering wheel, brake pedal, and even the accelerator he cries.      So the Police send an officer to the scene.    Oh it′s OK the drunk says with a hiccup when the policeman arrives. I got in the back by mistake.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A wife said to her husband, What do you mean by coming home half drunk!    He replied, it′s not my fault I ran out of Money!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Joe′s Dad picked him up from school. Knowing all the parts for the school play were chosen that day! He asked his  son if he got a role! Joe announced he indeed had, I play a man who has been married for twenty years.    Thats great son, says his Father, next time they might give you a speaking part!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    What is a Young Man′s most embarrasing moment!    When he walks into a wall (with an erection) and breaks his nose!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A small fellow walked into a bar and slipped on a pile of dog crap! He got up cleaned himself then walks to the bar  and orders a drink.    A giant of a man then comes into the bar, same thing happens, he too slips on the pile of dog crap! He also in turn gets up and cleans himself down, then moves to the bar and also orders a drink.    The small fellow nods to him and comments, Oh I just did that my friend!  The giant of a man then beat the small fellow!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    As the health inspector made his way around the bakery, he saw an employee pressing the pie edges down using his thumbs! Hey you he calls out, don′t you have a tool for doing that! Yes sure replies the young employee, but I use  that for putting the holes in the doughnuts!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    What is the definition of trust!    Two cannibals having oral sex!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A young girl runs out to the garden, to her Dad, she asks him, whats sex!    At first the father is shocked, but upon thought, thinks it best to be honest! He explains with a deep breath all  about the birds and the bees! By the time he is finished, the daughter is wide eyed indeed!     Why did you want to know this asks the Dad!    Because Mum said to tell you dinner would be ready in a couple of secs she replied!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    In England they have round mint sweets called polo mints. These mints have holes through the middle of them. Loose  ladies of the night, are nic named polo as it′s said, they make a mint out of their holes!     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    She was only the Fish Mongers Daughter, but she could lay in her Plaice and say Fillet!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    She was only the Post Masters Daughter. But she got plenty Male through her Box!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    I was chatted up by a young lady the other day. She had me all a fluster, she must have been a third my age! She managed to talk me into going with her into the local country fields! The excitement of it all was way to much and I got all confused. Next thing I know I was arrested for streaking! The police would not beleive my  story and were in fits of laughter!    I kept telling them how she got me to strip, as naked as she had then been, but then she told me to go to town!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    I went to the doctors, he sent me to see a Head Shrink. Problem was I kept getting an urge, to put my manhood into the bacon slicer where I worked! The head shrink failed to help me. I could not resist and gave in to temptation!    Now she is six month expectant!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Two elderly ladies have been friends for decades. Over the years they′ve shared all kinds of adventures.  But all lately, their activities have been limited to meeting a few times to play cards. One day, while  they′re playing. One looks at the other and says, now don′t get annoyed with me. I know we′ve been friends  for a long time but I just can′t remember your name. I′ve thought and thought, but I can′t remember, your name,  please tell me what it is. Her friend ponders over this for a good five minutes. Finally, she replies, how soon do you  need to know?    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Upon hearing her elderly Grandfather had passed away, young Julie rushes to her Grandmothers to offer comfort.  When she asks how her Grandfather died, her grandmother explained that he had a heart attack from making love on  Sunday mornings. Horrified Julie tells her that two people aged nearly 100 years, having sex would surely bring on  a heart attack. On no my dear her Grandmother replied, many years ago we realising our advancing age, we figured out  the best time to do it was when the church bells started ringing It was just the right rhythm. Nothing to strenuous  in with the ding out on the dong. She paused and wiped away a tear then continued. And if it had not been for that damn  ice cream van that came along, your granddad would still be alive.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    A penguin driving through Arizona on a hot summer′s day when he realises his car is leaking oil. So he finds a service  station and asks the mechanic to check his car over. He′s asked to leave it an hour and call back. Meanwhile the Penguin  went for a walk and had a large ice cream. His short little arms ensure the ice cream is all over his face. Returning to  the Garage ice cream all over his face, he asks what was wring with the car. The mechanic replied, looks like you′ve blown  a seal. No, no says the penguin it′s just ice cream.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    English man Oh I kiss my wife′s neck, when making love, she rises off the floor two inches or more?  French man, I kiss my Wife′s feet when making love, she rises a foot of the bed?  Italian man I kiss my Wife′s naval when making love, and she simply floats   Irish man, I wipe myself on the bed clothes after sex, my Wife hits the fuc*ing roof?    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    Daddy knocks a small deer over with his car and kills it out right?  No sign of injury so he reasons good meat waste not want not.  He takes it home and gets his wife to cook this.  He′s terrified to tell the kids what sort of meat it really is in case of upset?  Little Daughter says this is nice meat daddy what′s it called?  Oh say′s daddy, it′s what mum calls me quite often?  Older son throws cutlery down spits food out  He screams to young sister, don′t eat it, it′s a fuc*ing arsehole?        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                   Billions of Jokes via any of below   WWW Top Laughter   -   The Funny Sites.Com   Rate Us @ Humor Links   -   toplistcity Humor   Ecards Addict   -   Greetings100.com   Top Listed Sites Vote!   -   Humor Top.Com   StartEasy.com: Top Humor   -   StartEasy.com: Top Greetings                 View all our Categories      Birthday Cards      Anniversary Cards      Wedding Cards      New Baby Cards      Thank You Cards      Sorry Cards      Get Well Cards      Thank You Cards      Sorry Cards      Valentine Cards       Saint Patrick's Day Cards       Easter Cards      Mothers Day Cards      Wife Mothers Day Cards      Fathers Day Cards      Husband Fathers Day Cards      Independence Day Cards      Halloween Cards      Thanksgiving Day Cards      Christmas Cards      New Year Cards       Friendship Poems        Mother Poems        Father Poems        Sister Poems        Brother Poems        Love Poems      Angry Break Up Poems      Chat Up Lines      Funny Postcards      Insults      Luvis      Love Hugs      Love and Marriage Poems      Horror Poems      Funny Geordie Poems      Funny Poems       Shockwave Flash Cards       April Fools Day      Star Signs      Face Readings      Love Spells      Trick EXE Files       Wavs           How to Email Web Pages       Watch the latest videos on YouTube.com

clueweb09-enwp01-97-12012	"                     Toilet papering          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (July 2008)              A toilet papered house       Toilet papering  (also called  TP'ing  or  Yard Rolling ) is the act of covering an object (usually a tree, house, or other structure of similar size) with  toilet paper . This is typically done by throwing numerous toilet paper rolls in such a way that they unroll in mid-air and thus fall on the targeted object in multiple streams. Toilet papering is not uncommon in the  United States  and frequently takes place after the completion of a school's  homecoming  football game and graduation, as well as on  Halloween . [ citation needed ]   In some states in the United States, such as Texas and Virginia, toilet papering is considered an act of  mischief  or  vandalism  and may cause one to pay a  fine  or even go to  jail [ 1 ] . Many incidents of toilet papering, however, undoubtedly go unreported to police. Other activities that often accompany toilet papering, such as  egging  and  creaming , can cause serious property damage. As a result, toilet papering itself has been labeled in recent years as a dangerous activity [ citation needed ] , and many communities are tightening restrictions on it, sometimes ordering that stores not sell toilet paper to adolescents starting a week or so before the homecoming game, and making sure that police are actively scanning the streets on homecoming night to find potential toilet paperers. [ citation needed ]   Toilet papering can be done as an initiation, joke, or as a somewhat malicious (yet generally harmless) prank. Teachers, friends, school buildings, and other figures are popular targets for toilet-paperers. [ citation needed ]   Ring of Honor  wrestler  Jimmy Rave  has fans who throw toilet paper whenever he makes an entrance.

clueweb09-en0003-75-33191	"                 The White Trash Republican          Striving to achieve the biggest dang Carbon Footprint in the Ozarks!                           Friday, January 19, 2007                                            Live from the County Library: Apocalypse Now                                      Now where was I?... Oh yeah, that's right.  I'M STILL FRIGGIN' OFFLINE!!! Ah, but the good news is, folks, at least I have a line to be off of. The world just to the north of here wasn't so lucky. I'm sure you've seen all the vid clips that have been running all week on the network news shows. Almost all of those clips come from the Springfield area. OK, so there's a few from the Oklahoma area...but they are using primarily Ozark footage. So that gives you some idea of how devastating the destruction is. It's apocalyptic, it's armedgeddon...it's, dare I say?...Katrina-esque. I was here for the Big Ice of '87 and this is making that look like a small cola slurpee. It is jawdropping. Only a mere 20 miles kept us from abject chaos. We were just enough south that all we got was a buttload of rain and some flooding. So I was able to watch the mutha of all ice storms unfold on TV from the cozy comfort of my propane heated and electrically lighted home. I have to hand it to channel 3 one of the few Springfield stations that did manage to stay up and running for the whole event-their coverage was excellent and made for great TV. And they acted just as a media outlet should in a catastrophe. ""Just the facts, ma'am."" Very informative and professional. Even after a week of misery up there, folks are hanging tough. I have yet to see footage of disgruntled masses demanding some sort of help or rescue. No scenes of anarchy or widespread looting.  Wolf Blitzer is dismayed. Nope, despite shortages, long lines in the bitter cold and no telling when everyone will have power restored, us dumbass hillbillies are just doing what comes natural...taking care of our own. FEMA? We don't need no steenkin' FEMA! Although the FEMA boys are on the scene, no doubt, but assisting on the local government level. We got chains saws, we got pick ups, we got places to go for a warm meal and to take the chill off. We got our National Guard boys helping out. We got folks checking up on the farms and outlying areas and helping those folks out. Yep, we'll be alright.  That's just how ya do it around here. The contrast twixt here and Nawlins is startling. There has been so much going on I can't possibly comment, but I have been enjoying reading what all y'all have been writing. On a personal note, the 'puter is still crapped up. The geek nephew had his confidence pulled out from under him by his somewhat bullying father. I know the kid could fix it, but dad railed on the boy about it so bad, he gracefully bowed out from the project. So now I'm back to square one...facing a massive repair bill if the weather will ever cooperate long enough for me to make the 100 mile 'round trip to a competant repair shop. I vow to be back here from my own computer by Ground Hog Day! Of course, now the next ice storm may hit just a dab south of Springfield...so that would be us! So, I'm in town today replenshing the ""Oh Shit"" pantry, just in case. Y'all be cool, now, Ya hear?                                 posted by white trash republican at  Friday, January 19, 2007                    2 comments          links to this post                                                      Tuesday, January 02, 2007                                            Still MIA                                      Folks, I'm still down...quickly typing this from the local library. I was finally able to recall all my login info, so I could get on here and post. No telling how long I will be down. I'm at the mercy of a slacker savant to repair my rig and must abide by his somewhat loose but nevertheless seemingly ""busy"" schedule. I'll admit it may not be the most optimum method, but he works cheap, is a total genius when it comes to all things computerly, and besides-he's kin. The experts were trying to tell me I would basically need an all new rig-built by them, of course for a king's ransom and my hard drive would have to be slaved to the new one. I'm no pro from Dover, but that sounded lame as all get out. Computer techs are the new car repairmen of the 21st century...they are counting on your ignorance to weasel you outta some cash. I have a very low opinion of them, at least the yutzes around here. My resident savant says :  Bullshit...all you need is a new CPU. Yeah...that's what I was thinkin',too, Bucky. So now I wait for a new part and hopefully I will be back here sometime before the month is out. Obviously, it's pointless to email me, but at least I can still read & respond to comments on the blog, so go on ahead. Maybe I can get back into town next week and post. It's gonna be hit & miss for awhile.

Even though I sucked big time in this collection… I was trying new things in Adobe Lightroom…       You can find the rest in my  Flickr Page  and  My Gallery …   NOTE:  *   My Flickr Page will only have what I consider’em “My Favorites”… The rest of the pictures would be in My Gallery  *   If you checked My Gallery:Unsorted, you’ll see an interesting picture I took on my way to snap few shots at Plajat Street                                  This entry was posted             on Monday, January 12th, 2009 at 5:07 pm      and is filed under  Photography .

Li Wei states that these images are not computer montages and works with the help of props such as mirror, metal wires, scaffolding and acrobatics.   Source: Li Wei Art.  Link  posted by Drew.

Which is causing me to reflect on how much I take free, functioning technology for granted. I should be grateful I even get to have a blog. Thanks, Blogger. Now fix it. UPDATE:  After posting this, I decided to try one more time, and I kid you not, it worked. I'm certain Blogger's technical team reads this blog, was frightened into action by my commanding tone, and resolved the problem immediately.

clueweb09-en0008-41-00116	"            NEXT CLASS: January 5, 2009 -- Reserve your space today!                           Instructor:   DF Sweedler               Comedy Class published articles                 Readers Digest              http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/doing-stand-up-comedy/article29047.html                   New York Times - 10/18/08            http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/business/18pursuits.html                 Customer Testimonials       I would highly recommend to anyone whos ever thought        about doing standup to check out D.F.s class. Hell help turn anyones        confused musings into well-constructed jokes. The classes are set up like        workshops, where each joke is practiced and honed until its ready for the        stage. Ive already taken the class 4 times! D.F. creates an incredibly        supportive, unintimidating environment where students are encouraged to help        each other. I probably wouldnt have made it passed my first performance        without taking the class. Im now convinced that anyone can learn to be a        standup comedian.        -Marshall Stevenson                 Comic Strip Lives comedy class is the best place for        an aspiring comedian to learn their craft; the Strip has an unmatched record        of developing the most future stars of comedy. Some comedy instructors go        through the motions. But Comic Strip Lives D.F. Sweedler will help you find        the weaknesses in your writing, while giving you the tools to have a killer        set, in a fun, challenging environment. The class was instrumental in my      passing for the Comic Strip Live professional shows.       -Joe Machi               D.F. Sweedler has a quick comedic brain and is an        excellent editor, which is half the battle. Most comics use too many words.        After taking his course, I got a manager quickly and became a working        stand-up comic. If you have the ability, D.F. is the teacher to get you        there. The Comic Strip is a club known for developing new talent and        discovering hot comics. It is not just about commercialism. D.F. Sweedler        believes in teaching intelligent comedy. It is much harder to write a smart        joke than a dirty joke. He guides you to develop an act that you wont have      to rewrite if you book Leno or Letterman.       -Amanda Grumet                      ""We all know there are a lot of comedy classes and        teachers in the city. The advantage of studying with D.F. Sweedler is that        you get someone who really takes the comedians best interest at heart. Hes        honest with feedback and doesnt let you as a performer or writer take easy        way out. If a joke works he tells you. If it doesnt he wont let you slide.        Most importantly, you keep your own voice and learn how to build on your own        unique perspective. Some of the strongest talents Ive seen have gone      through his class.        -Michelle McGill               My name is Michael and I just made my 90 th  appearance at the Comic Strip. I took the course 21 months ago. If you are        serious about comedy, specifically stand-up, you have only one place to go        and one person to see; the Comic Strip and the personage of one D.F.        Sweedler. This is an 8-week course where you will write, rewrite and craft a        stand-up act. At the end, you will be on stage in one of the most famous        comedy clubs in the world, performing your stuff. Forget what your friends        say, unless they are Ray Romano, Larry David, or Jerry. Spend 8 weeks with        D.F. Sweedler, and whether you want it for a career, self-confidence or the        challenge, you will have a great new skill. Listen to me, do what I say.        Spend 8 weeks with D.F. The club will give you my number so you can call and      thank me.       -Michael Rakosi                 I would highly recommend the stand-up comedy class        held at The Word Famous Comic Strip Live. It has given me a venue and a        chance to learn, practice and perfect my materials. It has been a safe        environment where I know I have the support of my fellow classmates as well        as my experienced teacher. This class has assisted in my ability to write        quality material and through weekly opportunities to practice my work also        the confidence to be on my way to a successful career. It has also given me        a chance to perform in front of an audience at a real NYC club! This class      is a great opportunity and everyone who even thinks about it should enroll.       -Scott Rosenfeld                 I began comedy 7 years ago at the age of 50. It is        something I wanted to do 4ever but was never able to start. I then signed up        to take D.F. Sweedlers comedy course and weeks later I was finally on my        way. D.F. has patience and seems to be able to reach inside each student and      drag out what is funny for them. I highly recommend this class.       -Frank OKeefe               As Written for Swing Magazine       As funny as I Wanna Be?       & in which our writer takes a stab at stand-up comedy       By Tara McCarthy                        I was once flip and cool on the subject of        stand-up. Id watch comics and think, I could do that  no problem. But        when I called New Yorks Comic Strip Live to sign up for their 8-week        stand-up workshop, which culminates in a performance, suddenly my confidence        crumbled.    The guy at the club        was just taking down my credit card info, but I imagined him smugly nudging        someone beside him as if to say, Hey, weve got another idiot here who        thinks shes funny.       And I kind of do. But I kind of dont. And therein lies        the challenge &                       WEEK 1       Once there are about 15 people assembled in the Comic        Strip, our teacher introduces himself as D.F. Sweedler. So already Im        wondering what Ive gotten myself into. The guys got initials for a first        name, and he wont say what they stand for. Is this man with the slick hair        really going to make me funnier?       D.F. lays out the basics of stand-up form and gives us        some general advice -- Dont listen to anything your friends have to say.        They have no idea how to do this. -- then we all get up on stage to        introduce ourselves. I mention the experimental nature of this article as my        excuse to suck, which Im now confident I will. My complete lack of stage        presence is going to be a problem. The other four women are actresses.       Homework: two minutes of material  written down, not        memorized, because D.F. says its all going to change anyway. What        confidence in his pupils!       Two days later Ive settled on a topic: confusing signs        on public restrooms. I go to bed with stand-up on the brain and turn the        light on several times to jot down ideas. In the morning the only thing        thats legible and meaningful is John Grays Papaya. Last night the idea        of a hot dog joint with pictures of Mars and Venus differentiating the        bathrooms was funny. This morning its not. Do they even have Grays Papaya        outside of New York? D.F. warned against geography-specific jokes.                       WEEK 2       Felt confident on the way to class. Ive got a bunch        restroom-related jokes and I think theyre an okay start.        It took me a while to get used to these unisex        bathrooms they have more and more of these days. One time I came across one,        there was this door with hologram sticker on it and when you looked at it,        it changed from a man into a woman. So this was in a club in New York, so        Im standing there thinking, Wow, transsexuals have really come a long way,        but where am I supposed to go?       I go third-to-last and by then Im not feeling so sure        of myself. Rodney has already proven hes going to be the star pupil. Great        material, great delivery, I hate him. And Dylans got a really nice, warped,        drug-addicted pedophiliac shtick going. Ive no shtick to speak of.       D.F. annoys me when he points out all these picky        things in my material that dont make sense. He said last week that he was a        tough teacher but come on! Does this guy think anythings funny?                       WEEK 3       Ive stopped watching Make Me Laugh on Comedy Central        because its suddenly profoundly depressing. The comics almost never get the        contestant to crack up. I feel their pain.                       WEEK 4       After much revision, my bathroom materials tighter.        If I owned a bar, I wouldnt even have signs on the        bathrooms, Id cut right to the chase.    Thered be a long line of pissed-off looking women mannequins outside        the womens room so  wed  all know        where to go, and you guys wouldnt even get a room, just a fire hydrant in        the back corner.       On the downside, Im getting sick of it. I ask D.F.        whether its a function of the process that your jokes seem less funny each        week.       Some of my classmates seem to getting frustrated, too.        D.F.s crystal clear ban on jokes relating to masturbation and the like        suddenly makes sense. People are resorting to the lowest common denominator        to get laughs.                       WEEK 5       During class, I deliver two minutes of new material,        e.g.       The weather really is just getting stranger and        stranger. Like Texas this summer, where it was like 120 degrees for like 60        days. That kind of weather doesnt anybody any good, unless of course youre        in the slow-roasted chicken business.       The room is a vast laugh vacuum   bomb-a-rooney   D.F. says, Well,        that sure was a lot of stuff about the weather.    He picks apart the jokes (in as much as there were any) and offers        advice but Im discouraged.     Turns out I dont like things that dont come easily to me. I come from an        Irish-American family that prides itself on wit and whatnot. Stand-up was        supposed to be a snap, like it seems to be for Rodney. Hes just too damn        funny.                       WEEK 6       Rodney must die. No, wait. Scratch that. A line I        suggested has made it into his bit about a multi-cultural pre-school. I beam        with pride.                       WEEK 7       My brother keeps asking me if Im going to kill. I        am. Im going to kill the next person who asks me to do some of my bit for        them. I run through my whole five-minute set in class and its D.F.-approved        for the next weeks performance. There are a few jokes new to this week that        I like.       Ive been single for so long I decided I needed a new        marketing strategy, something to drum up business for my love life.    So I just had a t-shirt printed up that says I SELL BEANIE BABIES.       But Im not sure Im crazy about the rest of it. Its        like Ive created this character call Dry Girl and Im not sure I like her.        Will an audience?                       WEEK 8       An hour and a half before the show, I can no longer        function normally, so I head toward the Comic Strip and find a bar.    I know its ridiculous to be so nervous. So what if I make a fool of        myself in front of a bunch of strangers and the handful of close friends and        family I dared to invite & I do that at my local bar practically every        Friday night anyway.       As the club fills up (145 people!) and as my classmates        start to perform and be far funnier than theyve ever been in class, my        nerves only get worse.    I        confess my anxieties D.F. backstage minutes before I go on and he reassures        me he wouldnt let me  or anyone  go up if he didnt think theyd be okay        up there. Suddenly D.F. seems like the warmest, most trustworthy man in the        world, and I realize that my material wouldnt be anywhere close to        presentable without all of his damn picking, which I now see was actually        remarkably good teaching. But theres got to be something wrong with him.        Because why on earth would anyone do this for a living?       Well, because when youre up there, its completely        amazing  albeit completely weird. Youre acting as if you can actually see        people when in truth the audience is little more than shadows beyond the        faces right up front.    Once you        get your first laugh, you relax a little, then a little more with the next,        but youre preoccupied the whole time with remembering what comes next. Five        minutes feels, at once, like a blip and a lifetime.       But my God, its fun. Because, to paraphrase Sally        Fields, They liked me! Im sure this was one of the most generous stand-up        audiences ever  all family and friends of the comics  but they laughed        when they were supposed to laugh and even laughed at things I wasnt        expecting them to laugh at. I think I even pulled off some semblance of        stage presence. Sweet relief!       So Im going to do it again. And then maybe again.        Because maybe its the fact that its completely horrifying that makes it so        invigorating. As much as I hate to use the analogy, it really is like a        rollercoaster ride  only in this case its like you built the coaster        yourself. Mines admitted pretty rickety  more like Coney Islands Cyclone        than some Six Flags creation  but maybe thatll improve with time. You        really do never know until you try.

clueweb09-en0003-66-07140	"              skip to main   |        skip to sidebar               Pine Curtain Refugee         I have escaped from behind the fabled Pine Curtain of northeast Texas. I have learned much. Here is my tale...                           Wednesday, December 31, 2008         Saying goodbye to 2008 from the relative sanity of my cube at work.         I'm not working. I'm eating lunch at my desk, and then I'm leaving to go--gasp--grocery shopping. Why the gasp? Because I was just down in the godforsaken store, and it is a freakin' MADHOUSE, people. But shopping must occur because I'm preparing a vegetarian stew for Miss Lindsay's New Year's Day soiree tomorrow and, well, we just need groceries. Okay, so lots has happened since I last posted. Here's the update (stay with me): Tuesday evening (12/23) Started having very sharp chest pains unlike anything I'd ever experienced while shopping at Whole Foods. Figured they'd go away. They didn't. After over an hour of this mess, I called my insurance's ""nurse line,"" and described my symptoms and my medical history, and they were like, ""Get thee to the emergency room!"" So my darling husband drove my reluctant and beligerent ass to the ER, during which time the chest pains stopped (natch). But we went in anyway and spent 4 hours having the whole work-up done--blood tests, chest X-ray, EKG, cat scan, etc. By the time we left (around 10:30 pm), we were starving and we had no clue what had caused the chest pains. And they haven't happened again since (thank goodness). I'm really looking forward to getting the bills for that little night of fun. Wednesday (12/24) Woke up and started prepping to cook The Monochromatic Feast. First I prepared a breakfast casserole to be baked on Christmas morning. Then I prepped the squash and corn casserole and au gratin potatoes with goat cheese and chives for that evening's dinner. My mom and The Geej arrived from Horseshoe Bay, and I thought The Geej's eye's were going to bug out of her head when she saw all the new presents wrapped and placed under the tree since the last time she'd seen it. She was one excited little girl. Mom brought the smoked turkey breast and dressing, and we rounded out our dinner with a mixed green salad with bleu cheese, walnuts and pears.  Needless to say, we were all STUFFED when dinner was over. We somehow convinced The Geej that she needed to go to sleep so that Santa could come and do his thing, and then we followed pretty soon after. Thursday, 12/25 The Geej woke up at the crack of dawn to see her loot from the fat man.  She was very happy with everything she got, especially the new baby stroller to replace her old one that she'd literally worn out. I got BH a set of rowing lessons and a one-month membership to  The Rowing Dock , and he got me a gift certificate for not one, but THREE massages. We also got each other garden gnomes--Matthew and Norm--but that's a whole 'nother story.  Christmas evening, we went over to La Turista's to visit with her family and chow down on tamales. Friday, 12/26 BH fetched his boys, and we had a second round of present-opening. They each wanted--and received--kick-ass new skateboards, and the weather was great outside, so there was much skateboarding in the afternoon. BH also gave the family a 40-lb. punching bag and a bunch of boxing gloves so we can punch and hit and kick to our hearts' content. Dah went back to HSB. Saturday, 12/27 thru Monday, 12/29 Hung out. Ate. Cooked. Napped. Played with the kids. Hung out some more. Played with the kittens. Tried to keep The Geej and BH's youngest from bugging each other to death. Had dinner with BH's mom and step-dad who were visiting. Had another round of present opening during which The Geej received this ensemble:  On Monday, I went back to work. Tuesday, 12/30 Worked, and then went to happy hour with four of my favorite gals at the recently remodeled and reopened Paggi House. It was AWESOME. We sat outside (yes, it was nice enough to sit outside), drank wine, ate cheese and crackers, talked, and laughed laughed laughed. Which brings us to today. As I said, I've got to go grocery shop, then I will fill up my car, go fetch The Geej (she's been at my mom's since Sunday b/c school's closed), return home and cook, clean, and (hopefully) take down that dadgum Christmas tree/kitten magnet. So goodbye, and good riddance 2008. During this past year I landed a new husband and two step-sons, got a new car, and voted in a new president. I watched my 401(k) and Roth IRAs dwindle and the price of gas soar and plunge. I joined Facebook and didn't blog as much as I should've. I had to put the best cat of all time to sleep because he had an advanced, incurable disease, and I welcomed two new, absolutely insane kittens into our family. I watched my daughter complete her transformation from toddler to little girl. I spent my last year in my thirties. I faced very difficult and trying times at work and passed my 9 year anniversary there as well. And I celebrated my 4 year blogiversary. Thanks for coming by and reading about my silly life. Hope to see you again in '09.

I had a very similiar chest pain like thing - ended up to be a gallbladder attack.  It took them forever to figure it out (like 2 months - they found something ""suspicious"" while doing an echocardiogram.  The suspiciousness was gallstones).  I had really weird symptoms after the chest pain thing - I ended up getting my gallbladder out and it resolved quite a few of the issues I was having.  A gallbladder attack can feel like a heartattack, a pain in the shoulders or back.  And it can stop as suddenly as it starts.  *Just saying - If they didn't check it out - you might want to see if you've got any gallstones in there (can be done with an ultrasound) - they typically follow the 4Fs - Female, Fair, Forty and Fat.  I'm not saying that you're forty or fat (and neither was I. :))  But, you are certainly female and fair.  My verfication word is crabuche - LAUGH!          9:06 PM                      Post a Comment                                   Newer Post       Older Post     Home          Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)               These People Actually Admit to Reading This Thing!!

Hey everyone!  My name is Stephanie and I am one of the two people who takes the Rock Art Show on the road.  I just wanted to take this time to introduce myself and to tell you how to get yourself into our blog!  Occasionally, I will be posting photographs of people who come to the shows either while they are looking at art or with their newly purchased pieces!  If you want to be on the blog, just say ""hey Steph, post me on the blog"" and I will do my best to get you on here. Now onto business...thanks to everyone who has come out to see us at the 92 KQRS Rock Art Show in Minneapolis/St. Paul area.  So far everyone here has been really great--and we are looking forward to coming back to the twin cities.  And thank you to mother nature for cooperating--so far, NO SNOW! Alright, I guess I better get back to work.  And remember, the most important day of the year is on TUESDAY (January 24th)...my 23rd birthday!  If you have any questions, comments, concerns, wanna buy something, wanna say hi, etc. etc. etc., please feel free to contact me at any time at...  RockArtShow@aol.com .  Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you at a show soon! -Stephanie             #  posted by stephanie : 7:25 PM                             Comments:                     Stephanie -- I met you at the Philadelphia Rock Art Show this past year (WMGK 102.9).  You can't beleive how many much attention the ""Saturday Morning Beatles"" piece you helped me bring home gets in my house.  Just wanted to say thanks again.       #  posted by    Doug  : 11:09 AM                       Post a Comment                                   << Home                                           Sign Up Now!

Please send us your pictures and stories. We share your passion for windsurfing.                           Wednesday, February 15, 2006                                            Think your tough?                                      Then lets see you try to break this. In the past Euro Pin systems have had a tendency to have the pin shear off, leaving you hopefully not to far from shore trying to figure out what to do with your rig now that it isn't attached to your board. The brain cells as Chinook have taken care of that once and for all with their new pin system.  It is all cast from one solid piece of stainless steel, meaning that there is nothing threaded, screwed, or held together with locktite.  So, unless you are regulary breaking stainless steel rods, this might just be the new mast base for you.                                posted by Windsurfing Direct at  11:40 AM                                                             0 Comments:                                   Post a Comment                               << Home                                          www. flick r .com     This is a Flickr badge showing public photos from  Windsurfing Direct .

In my movie Z-team , the sabers hit alot , for about 1min:20sec ...soo now for the question How in the H3ll do yu make a light saber hit , ya know , like a flash. I tried render / photo flash , did not work ,I tries a white splch (new word I just made it) and that looked so crapy , I mean really bad. any one help me?!?!?!?!? ------------------ ~~GG~~ ~~RJ~~ http://ggi.homepage.com       NJRFilms           posted 02-29-2000 06:17 PM               Thats funny, cuz i was about to ask the same questin. Ive got a few of others saber tests and what they seem to do is have a white circle where they hit. Tell me if u figure it out.       Phil the Giant Robot           posted 02-29-2000 06:39 PM               Okay, this took me awhile to get, too. everybody elses instructions were kinda confusing, so i'm gonna make this as easy as possible. Here We Go! 1) right click the projects window and select import->file 2)choose your lightsaber footage and open it 3)drag the little icon signifying the existance of you footage into the right hand window. when you do this, you should also see it appear in the timeline window. 4) in the right hand window, move the little bar at the bottom of the window to the place where you want the flare to start. 5) select the icon signifying the existance of your footage in the TIMELINE window, causing it to get a dotted line around it. 6) right click the newly selcted footage in the timeline window and select ""effects"" 7) choose ""Lens Flare"" and click add. 8) press okay 9) when you see a little blue bar over the footage window in the timeline window, that means you gots it    10) render it! there ya go, in ten easy steps, too! funny how that works out     enjoy!

I would not think it would matter on video for one frame.  That is just my opinion though.

I'm sure you guys don't really want to hear about Trash standing in the salad, or (later in the evening) Gillian falling off the couch and me dancing in  Annie's  kitchen with Lucy Locket tucked in my back pocket do you???    Of course yesterday we had the Trash and Treasure  blog meet  here in  Ballarat  and like anyone who has ever had a  blog meet  knows - it is just so much fun to hang out with people who get it ! And boy do they get it....... Gillian Bernadette JO Rachel Kathryn Annie Emma Janette Lara Holly Trash Jan Nikki Kellie Sonya   would have to be the most interesting, funny and slightly loopy group of women I have spent a day with in a very long time. We shopped a little and talked a  LOT !   If you want to see all the photos you'll have to visit all the other blogs because I was, of course far far too busy preparing things and being a hostess and dropping salad on the ground to actually take many ...... (talking non-stop and eating cake mostly) It was a lovely day and we were all surprised to see Lucy Locket arrive. (She got a little untidy later in the evening....We told her not to mix her drinks )    and as for Trash........she is EXACTLY who you would expect if you read her blog.......only 100% more fabulously so !!!! I keep trying to explain how much fun I had and how awesome each person is and  I fear I am starting to sound a little Oprah- ish   but as I drove home  late  last night from Annies place , with Lucy Lockett tucked in her seat belt in the seat next to me, after we had been blogmeeting for about 12 hours straight, I looked over at Lucy and she was still smiling that great big Lucy grin..........  and so was I !

I made a wee quilt and I think its O.K.  I tried hand quilting for the first time. and I used  pearle  cotton , 'cause everyone raves about it. I practised my wonky french knots...... BUT My little girl has nothing to say...........any suggestions??? You know what ? I don't think having nothing to say will be a problem on  Saturday . Great people are coming and I know  Ballarat  is kinda in the middle of nowhere, but some delightful  Melbourne   bloggers  are coming along by train and by car and  Silly Gilly  (maybe that name means something ) is actually driving over from Adelaide and planning to stop at every op-shop she passes....... Come on , jump on the train, get in the car - it'll be fun and I am even going to cook a cake !!! ( I am using a  flourless  cake recipe for those of you who may be  concerned ).

Normally residing in the UK,  Trash  is originally from  Ballarat .  Of course this is too good an opportunity to miss and we local  bloggers  have been in negotiations to be included on the itinerary of her Great Trip Home for some time.   So without further ado you are all cordially invited to the  Trash and Treasure  Blogmeet When  :  Saturday January 10 th Where :  Ballarat  Patchwork  at 11 am followed by the  Eureka Park  There should be  a map  if you follow that link. Please come ! If you don't know Trash,  that's   OK  - heaps of  bloggers  will be there and we all promise to be on our best behaviour and play nicely and give everyone a turn on the swings. Here's  the plan, we all meet at  Ballarat  Patchwork at 11 am - ish  where the delightful Miss  Scrapbag  has, I believe organised door prizes. After a bit of a  looky  and a bit of a  shoppy  we can all head off to the Eureka Park. This park has tables,  BBQ's , a playground, a little lake often housing a duck or two, some canons, toilets: all the stuff required by a local park and this park is just a hop skip and jump from my house in case of those....oops we have no can-opener type moments. The park is also next to the local pool in case you want bring your bikini along and have a quick post lunch dip. ( I won't actually be joining in that part myself but thought I'd mention it anyway). The park is also home to the Eureka Centre (Historical interest) so you could always tell people you are going to  Ballarat  to visit the home of the Eureka Stockade, if saying you are going to meet a bunch of people that you ""met on the  Internet "" , is going to raise eyebrows. What to bring  : Just bring along a bit of a picnic , maybe a rug to sit on. NO hassle, no stress, no competition for the worlds best exotic picnic triple layered flan. OK ? Email if you have any questions or if you want my number to sort stuff out or just to let me know that you wouldn't miss it for the world!

Figuring that I had  EITTTS  on the run by now, I thought I'd give it a go. Hey presto !  Then I got to wondering how it would look if I used a photo, so I printed Seamus out on some  ink jet  printer fabric. Then I decided to make that I will actually use.......so here it is. School report circa Yr 10 (age about 16).   That last comment states ""Jodie shows little interest in computing + spends far too much time being a nuisance"" In my defence I'd like to state that I  did computing twice a week for a whole year and that man never once mentioned blogging !!!

So, unlike yesterday when I persisted in banging my head against a  selvedge  brick wall and had five attempts at something that still ended up in the bin..........today I decided to do something simple, easy and  finishable . At the end of the day I will be able to say ""I made some button brooches today , and they worked and they are pretty cute."" Which is just as well, because when you use the wrong flour in your Apricot bloody shortcake, it comes out more like Apricot  kitchensponge . ( Ummm   Annie,  I will still be over for afternoon tea and yes I will still bring along something yummy....... Maybe more of a shop-bought kind of yummy though.)

Look who came to live with me....... Fern ! Isn't she the cutest little monkey you have ever seen. She is all woolly and gorgeous and has the cutest little thumbs in the world. Thanks so much Chris. The day Fern arrived I also got a beautifully wrapped parcel from Karen of  Selvageblog   eeek ................ a teeny tiny little quilt cupboard. How clever is this? And Karen sent this to me ""just because"". Just because she is lovely -obviously. Thanks Karen, it is a hoot! You guys know that this is the only way I will ever have a cupboard full of quilts. So while the sewing room is undergoing some serious renovations ( That's  a big fat lie, it is just a  phenomenal  mess). Fern and my little cupboard are sitting on the  mantelpiece , overseeing the left-overs being eaten , the children kicking back, and me drawing and redrawing and swearing at some new projects.

Every time  I walked past I wondered who it was from, and of course what was inside. I did give it a squeeze or two so I am very glad it had no pins in it.   My  SSCS  swap partner was Deb of  The Angel and the  Pukeko  and she made me this beautiful table runner. There were also sweets (all eaten) and gorgeous  smellies  in the parcel as well. I think it must be the year of the table runner because I sent one to my  SSCS  swap partner as well. (I have to admit that the one I sent was nowhere near as complex as the one that Deb sent to me.)    Thanks so much Deb , I do really love this and we used it on Christmas Day and (insert small miracle here) no-one spilt anything on it ! Whilst I want to say a huge  thank you  to Deb for her beautiful gift I know that everyone who took part this year would also like to give a rousing cheer to  ChookyBlue  for organising this swap. So many many people from so many different countries were involved and she kept us all up-to-date and in line and on time...and lets be honest that's no mean feat. Thanks  Chooky  !

That is why I have been on guard regularly. Some have gotten away with posting spam topics on porn, viagra, and what-nots. But fear not, I come armed now. I have changed the forum’s settings in such a way that all registrations to the board must be first approved by me. So, I am sorry to say to all these no-gooders that their happy days are now over. But, let this not hinder other interested Pinay Bloggers from joining us at the forum.   Ciao for now!               News                                     Welcome Jeng!

As previously mentioned in Round 1, the subdomains are to be given on a quarterly basis. I have decided to give them out every other month instead. That is why the next draw will take place as early as end of January 2009.   For Round 2, the topic that your blog entry must revolve around on is: “ What do you love most about being a blogger? ” But as always, continue to invite your readers who are non-members of PBF to join us at the forum.   I forgot to add that all non-winning contestants from a previous raffle are automatically included in the next round. They won’t have to post any new blog entries anymore (but don’t let me stop you from posting one ha..   ), but you will have to resubmit your URLs at the appropriate forum thread if you want to participate in the draw again.     That’s it so far. I’ll be revising this post should I remember anything I may have forgotten so please regularly check on the blog for updates.   On other things… It’s already December. For those who are participating in the Christmas Gift Exchange, are you already done with your shopping? You got two more weeks left, which is not much time really, especially at this busy time of the year. Good luck, but most of all, have fun shopping!

And as promised, I drew today our winner of the first ever Pinay Bloggers’ Forum Raffle.   I previously mentioned in the forum that since there were only two contestants who qualified for this month’s raffle, I won’t be doing the draw electronically. Instead, I’ve asked my hubby J to do the honors. The little girl was supposed to do it, but she’s fallen asleep already. So, without further ado, let me announce our winner… via photos of course!      J picking out the winner   Winner of First Ever PBF Raffle   Congratulations to  Jengki !

While the name has changed, the talent certainly still remains.  This Bay Area band crafts some damn fine jams, with the A-side single ""Pushing and Shoving"" for an upcoming release features some hand-clapping, sng-alonging, and break-neck pacing.  I love how it teeters on destruction and desperation, but never seems to slip over the line.  While already posted by  more  reputable sites, I thought I'd pass this along to the loyal Macktronic readers in case you missed it. :::  Man/Miracle - Pushing and Shoving You can  pre-order the single on either vinyl 7"" or CD .  The covers are hand-screened and pretty nice, if I do say so myself.

clueweb09-en0003-32-30799	              skip to main   |        skip to sidebar               The Kyloe Experiment                                     Friday, June 27, 2008         the secret of a happy garden...        We've always known that the secret of a happy garden is a generously sized compost-heap.  And these days that is also the secret of a happy & well-supplied kitchen, and a happy & well-fed fruitarian.   Cape gooseberries everywhere, and in the shade of every mulched tree, some sort of tomato - tiny little cherries, all the way up to heavy fleshy globes.  Young papino and avo seedlings, pomegranate, guava & date - right through the household's menu - all kinds of seeds & pips now grown into generous new life. What a lovely thing to suddenly find, in a most unexpected place, something delicious which required no attention, care or investment, but has been quietly growing towards that moment when the winter sun lights the shrubby corner next to the wide, deep stoep and reveals the little papery lanterns - this year's unplanned crop of Cape gooseberries. A happy little moment, repeated all over the garden, throughout the year.  Simple pleasures which somehow weave something rather special into the texture of an already rich life.

My dear fans, I am so sorry for not having found time to write on my   blog for some time. I am using my time to construct plans for world   domination in the year of 2008. I am also using a lot of time to   further work on my merchandise which I hope to have ready to be in   stores near you soon. If not near you where you are, then near you on   the internet. I am waiting so much to get this all up and running! I   love dancing!                                posted by Pjotro at        Monday, October 29, 2007                                                                                                     Merchandising                                      After I have posted the picture of the Pjotro swimwear I have   realised that there may be many other requests for other Pjotro-  branded merchandise. Therefore I am now planning to create a range of   Pjotro merchandise. So far I have created some designs for t-shirts,   posters, bags and so on. If there is something special you would like   to have with Pjotro, please write to me and I will try to make your   dreams come true. If you like to drink coffee, maybe you like the   design for my cups?                                posted by Pjotro at        Monday, October 01, 2007                                                                                                     Another fan mail                                      Mr David Brown from London has written to me. Mr Brown writes Congratulations on such a successful piece of work and added some questions:   1. Have you considered putting dancers from other music genres into your suit?  - My suit is made for me and me only. Even though I could create different sounds to make for other genres, I would not like to have any other person in my suit with me.    2. Have you tried to map real-world instrument sounds to your suit? - The sounds that I make are from the real world. What do you mean?   3. Do the moves come about because you like a sound that's made, or do you like a sound then map it to a gesture? - I like music, and I like to dance. I would like to think that I create my moves and music in both ways. Sometimes the music makes the move, and sometimes the move makes the music.    Thank you David Brown for writing to me, and good luck with your projects! /Pjotro.                                posted by Pjotro at        Monday, September 17, 2007                                                                                                     I have enjoyed vacation                                      This summer I have also been on vacation. I went to the beach.  The weather was hot and the water was warm. I decided to go without my suit. I did not think that swimming in the suit was very good idea, because water and electronics do not mix. I devised a pair of swimming-shorts from some left over material  from my suit production. I met a man who loved my swim-shorts so much that I have given them to him. He was so happy, he even sent me a picture of himself wearing them. Hot, yes?                                posted by Pjotro at        Thursday, September 06, 2007                                                                                                     The top inventions of all time                                      Being an inventor, I have many favourite items that have been   invented. On my list of favourite inventions of all time I have   included the following items. The oscilloscope (great for viewing   signal voltages). The soldering iron (I cannot live without it). The   Nokia N95 (I am very pleased with this invention). The football   (comment not needed). My suit. I believe you must try my suit to   fully understand how intelligent it is. I hope to arrange a testing   day soon. This was my list.                                posted by Pjotro at        Wednesday, August 29, 2007                                                                                                     My dream collaborations                                      Although I am now a real music artist, I have other musical dreams and ambitions. Among many these include my dream duets and performances. Including typical artists such as Jean-Jacques Perrey, Jean-Michel Jarre, Gary Numan, and Klaus Schulze  but I also think about performing with modern musicians such as A Flock of Seagulls, Roxy Music, The Human League, or even The Moog Cookbook. If I could sing with someone, I would have to sing with Cher. She is the best.                                posted by Pjotro at        Friday, August 24, 2007                                                                                                     New dance moves                                      I have spent some time now with my new suit. The new sounds have enabled me to create new moves. I have fitted a tone-shift to the suit. With this I can now create sounds for a longer time. I consider my new sounds to have more emotion. And feeling. Perhaps I can even bend the tone-space continuum? It is amazing. I combine the movements of the head and body, my dance is now better then ever before. I hope you will enjoy!                                posted by Pjotro at        Monday, August 13, 2007                                                                                       Links                                              Pjotro vs. Dj eFFeX           Be my friend           See all of my photos           Multimedia computers           I love engineering           My N95           Another guy with a suit that can't make music            My most precious tool is a soldering iron                     Previous Posts                      My apologies.
