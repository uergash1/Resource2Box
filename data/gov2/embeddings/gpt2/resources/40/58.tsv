GX000-11-11539521	"New York State Library  |   Database Gateway     E-books Available Online    Our collection of netLibrary electronic books (e-books) contains 3,772 copyrighted  books and thousands of public domain titles. The 3,772 copyrighted e-books are  also available via our online  Catalog .                            Accessing E-books in the NYSL Catalog:  Search for online electronic books          available to  registered New York State Library borrowers and onsite          users:                           Keywords     Authors     Titles     Subjects                                     New York State Library E-book Collection      A valid  New York State Library    borrower's card  is required to access copyrighted e-books.        On your first visit to the netLibrary site, you will need to create an account    at netLibrary:         Set      up a netLibrary account.  [FOR FIRST TIME USERS] Use this link      to set up a netLibrary account via the State Library's proxy server. Please      use your  New York State Library borrower's card number  and       PIN  as your netLibrary username and password. If your PIN      is not long enough, please add two zeros to the end of your PIN number.             For best results, once you have created a netLibrary account,  log out       of netLibrary. Use the Back button on your browser to return to this page      and click on the link below to re-enter netLibrary. Use your new netLibrary      account to log in.         Use netLibrary .     If you've already set up an account with netLibrary, use this link to access    netLibrary without going through our proxy server. For more details about logging    in to netLibrary, see  How to Access E-books .   netLibrary Public Collection of E-books    netLibrary's Public Collection includes thousands of classic works of fiction,    speeches, government reports, and other texts that are in the public domain    (no longer copyrighted). All of these e-books have an electronic table of contents,    and are searchable. A list of the free e-books is located on the netLibrary    site.    Note:  You do not need to be a registered New York State Library borrower    to access the  public domain  titles at netLibrary; however,    you must still create a personal netLibrary account in order to check them out.     Tips for Using netLibrary    Searching for e-books:  When searching for a book, be sure to include synonyms or to truncate. You will get more results in free text rather than keyword searching. In a Quick Search, truncation is automatic. When doing a Command Search, use the asterisk (*) for truncation.    Viewing e-books:   There are two methods of viewing e-books online at netLibrary - BROWSE and CHECK-OUT.          BROWSE  allows you to view the book online for a short time. However,      once you actively stop turning pages, the e-book will become inactive after      15 minutes (so as to be available to others). While using BROWSE and actively      moving through the e-book, no one else can access the book.               CHECK-OUT  exclusively reserves an e-book to one Library borrower      for the length of the CHECK-OUT period. 1       When the checkout time expires, the e-book is  automatically returned       to the Library.       ( To  return the book  before then, select ""Check in E-book""      from the drop-down list on the Ebookshelf page, or click on ""Check In this      E-book"" from the Reading Room tab.)      NetLibrary has a Help section with more information about search options, reading online, printing, and other frequently asked questions.       1  Note :  - The 172  e-books in the New York State Library's own collection have a 7-day check-out  period. The 3,600 e-books shared with other libraries may be checked-out for four hours. Within both of these collections, however, any books designated as ""Reference"" can be checked out for only two hours.  If you wish to see time remaining for your check-out period, or if you wish to return your e-book, click on "" Reading Room "" on the netLibrary  site.
