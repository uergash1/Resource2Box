For other uses, see  Yahoo (disambiguation) .     Yahoo! Inc.

Inc.  ( NASDAQ :  YHOO ) is an  American   public   corporation  with headquarters in  Sunnyvale, California , (in  Silicon Valley ), and provides  Internet  services worldwide. The company is perhaps best known for its  web portal ,  search engine ,  Yahoo! Directory ,  Yahoo! Mail , news, and  social media   websites  and services. Yahoo! was founded by  Jerry Yang  and  David Filo  in January 1994 and was incorporated on  March 1 ,  1995 .   On  January 13 ,  2009 , Yahoo appointed  Carol Bartz , former executive chairman of  Autodesk , as its new chief executive officer and a member of the  board of directors . [ 4 ]   According to Web traffic analysis companies (including  Compete.com ,  comScore , [ 5 ]   Alexa Internet , [ 6 ]   Netcraft , [ 7 ]  and  Nielsen Ratings [ 8 ] ), the domain  yahoo.com  attracted at least 1.575 billion visitors annually by 2008. [ 9 ]  The global network of Yahoo! websites receives 3.4 billion page views per day on average as of October 2007 [update] . It is the second most visited website in the  U.S. , and the most visited website in the world.

In April 1994, ""Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web"" was renamed ""Yahoo!"", for which the official expansion is ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle"". [ 10 ]  Filo and Yang said they selected the name because they liked the word's general definition, which comes from  Gulliver's Travels  by  Jonathan Swift : ""rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."" Its  URL  was akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo. [ 11 ]   By the end of 1994, Yahoo! had already received one million hits. The Yahoo! domain was created on January 18, 1995. [ 12 ]  Yang and Filo realized their website had massive business potential, and on  March 1 ,  1995 , Yahoo! was  incorporated . [ 13 ]  On  April 5 ,  1995 ,  Michael Moritz  of  Sequoia Capital  provided Yahoo! with two rounds of venture capital, raising approximately $3 million. [ 14 ] [ 15 ]  On  April 12 ,  1996 , Yahoo! had its  initial public offering , raising $33.8 million, by selling 2.6 million shares at $13 each.   Like many  search engines  and  web directories , Yahoo! diversified into a  Web portal . In the late 1990s, Yahoo!,  MSN ,  Lycos ,  Excite  and other Web portals were growing rapidly. Web portal providers rushed to acquire companies to expand their range of services, in the hope of increasing the time a user stays at the portal.   On  March 8 ,  1997 , Yahoo! acquired online communications company Four11. Four11's webmail service,  Rocketmail , became  Yahoo! Mail . Yahoo! also acquired ClassicGames.com and turned it into  Yahoo! Games . Yahoo! then acquired direct marketing company Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. on October 12. On  March 8 ,  1998 , Yahoo! launched Yahoo! Pager, [ 16 ]  an instant messaging service that was renamed  Yahoo! Messenger  a year later. On  January 28 ,  1999 , Yahoo! acquired web hosting provider  GeoCities . Another company Yahoo! acquired was  eGroups , which became  Yahoo! Groups  after the acquisition on  June 28 ,  2000 .   When acquiring companies, Yahoo! often changed the relevant  terms of service . For example, they claimed  intellectual property  rights for content on their  servers , unlike the companies they acquired. As a result, many of the  acquisitions  were controversial and unpopular with users of the existing services. [ clarification needed ]          Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale         [ edit ]   Dot-com bubble (20002001)   Yahoo! stock doubled in price in the last month of 1999. [ 17 ]  On  January 3 ,  2000 , at the height of the  Dot-com boom , Yahoo! stocks closed at an all-time high of $118.75 a share. Sixteen days later, shares in  Yahoo! Japan  became the first stocks in Japanese history to trade at over 100,000,000, reaching a price of 101.4 million ($94,780 at that time). [ 18 ]   On  February 7 ,  2000 , the Yahoo! domain was brought to a halt for a few hours as it was the victim of a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ). [ 19 ]  On the next day, its shares rose about $16, or 4.5 percent as the failure was blamed on  hackers  rather than on an internal  glitch , unlike a fault with  eBay  earlier that year.   During the dot-com boom, the cable news station  CNBC  also reported that Yahoo! and  eBay  were discussing a 50/50  merger . [ 20 ]  Although the merger never materialized the two companies decided to form a marketing/advertising alliance six years later in 2006. [ 21 ]   On  June 26 ,  2000 , Yahoo! and  Google  signed an agreement which retained Google as the default world-wide-web search engine for Yahoo! following a beta trial in 1999. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Post dot-com bubble (20022009)   Yahoo! was one of the few surviving large Internet companies after the  dot-com bubble  burst. Nevertheless, on  September 26 ,  2001 , Yahoo! stocks closed at a five-year low of $4.06 (split-adjusted).   Yahoo! formed partnerships with  telecommunications  and Internet providers to create content-rich  broadband  services to compete with  AOL . On  June 3 ,  2002 ,  SBC  and Yahoo! launched a national co-branded  dial  service. [ 23 ]  In July 2003,  BT  Openworld announced an alliance with Yahoo!. [ 24 ]  On  August 23 ,  2005 , Yahoo! and  Verizon  launched an integrated  DSL  service. [ 25 ]   In late 2002, Yahoo! began to bolster its search services by acquiring other search engines. In December 2002, Yahoo! acquired  Inktomi . In February 2005, Yahoo! acquired Konfabulator and rebranded it  Yahoo! Widgets , [ 26 ]  a desktop application and in July 2003, it acquired  Overture Services, Inc.  and its subsidiaries  AltaVista  and  AlltheWeb . On  February 18 ,  2004 , Yahoo! dropped Google-powered results and returned to using its own technology to provide search results.   In 2004, in response to  Google 's release of  Gmail , Yahoo! upgraded the storage of all free Yahoo! Mail accounts from 4  MB  to 1 GB, and all Yahoo! Mail Plus accounts to 2 GB. On  July 9 ,  2004 , Yahoo! acquired e-mail provider  Oddpost  to add an  Ajax  interface to  Yahoo! Mail . [ 27 ]  On  October 13 ,  2005 , Yahoo! and Microsoft announced that  Yahoo! Messenger  and  MSN Messenger  would become interoperable. In 2007, Yahoo! took out the storage meters, thus allowing users unlimited storage.   Yahoo! continued acquiring companies to expand its range of services, particularly  Web 2.0  services. Yahoo! Launchcast became  Yahoo! Music  on  February 9 ,  2005 . On  March 20 ,  2005 , Yahoo! purchased photo sharing service  Flickr . [ 28 ]  On  March 29 ,  2005 , the company launched its blogging and social networking service  Yahoo! 360 . In June 2005, Yahoo! acquired  blo.gs , a service based on RSS feed aggregation. Yahoo! then bought online social event calendar  Upcoming.org  on  October 4 ,  2005 . Yahoo! acquired social bookmark site  del.icio.us  on  December 9 ,  2005  and then playlist sharing community  webjay  on  January 9 ,  2006 .   On  August 27 ,  2007 , Yahoo! released a new version of  Yahoo! Mail . It adds Yahoo! Messenger integration. (which includes Windows Live Messenger due to the networks'  federation ) and free text messages (not necessarily free to the receiver) to mobile phones in the  U.S. ,  Canada ,  India  and the  Philippines . [ 29 ]   On  January 29 ,  2008 , Yahoo! announced that the company was laying off 1,000 employees as the company had suffered severely in its inability to effectively compete with industry search leader  Google . The cuts represent 7 percent of the company's workforce of 14,300. Employees are being invited to apply for an unknown number of new positions that are expected to open as the company expands areas that promise faster growth. [ 30 ]   In February, 2008, Yahoo! acquired  Cambridge, Massachusetts -based Maven Networks, a supplier of internet video players and video advertising tools, for approx. $160 million.   Yahoo! announced on  November 17 ,  2008  that Yang would be stepping down as CEO. [ 31 ]   On  December 10 ,  2008 , Yahoo! began laying off 1,520 employees around the world as the company tries to deal with its financial difficulties. [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Acquisition attempt by Microsoft   Microsoft  and Yahoo! pursued  merger  discussions in 2005, 2006, and 2007, that were all ultimately unsuccessful. At the time, analysts were skeptical about the wisdom of a business combination. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]   On  February 1 ,  2008 , after its friendly takeover offer was rebuffed by Yahoo!, Microsoft made an unsolicited  takeover  bid to buy Yahoo! for US$44.6 billion in cash and stock. [ 35 ] [ 36 ]  Days later, Yahoo! considered alternatives to the merger with Microsoft, including a merger with internet giant  Google [ 37 ]  or a potential transaction with  News Corp . [ 38 ]  However, on  February 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! decided to reject Microsoft's offer as ""substantially undervaluing"" Yahoo!'s brand, audience, investments, and growth prospects. [ 39 ]  As of February 22, two Detroit based pension companies have sued Yahoo! and their board of directors for breaching their duty to shareholders by opposing Microsoft's takeover bid and pursuing ""value destructive"" third-party deals. [ 40 ] [ dead link ]  In early March, Google CEO  Eric Schmidt  went on record saying that he was concerned that a potential Microsoft-Yahoo! merger might hurt the Internet by compromising its openness. [ 41 ]  The value of Microsoft's cash and stock offer declined with Microsoft's stock price, falling to $42.2 billion by April 4. [ 42 ]  On April 5, Microsoft CEO  Steve Ballmer  sent a letter to Yahoo!'s board of directors stating that if within three weeks they had not accepted the deal, Microsoft would approach shareholders directly in hopes of a electing a new board and moving forward with merger talks. [ 43 ] [ dead link ]  In response, Yahoo! stated on April 7 that they were not against a merger, but that they wanted a better offer. In addition, they stated that Microsoft's ""aggressive"" approach was worsening their relationship and the chances of a ""friendly"" merger. [ 44 ]  Later the same day, Yahoo! stated that the original $45 billion offer was not acceptable. [ 44 ]  Following this, there has been considerable discussion of having  Time Warner 's  AOL  and Yahoo! merge, instead of the originally proposed Microsoft deal. [ 45 ]   On  May 3 ,  2008 , Microsoft withdrew their offer. During a meeting between Ballmer and Yang, Microsoft had offered to raise its offer by $5 billion to $33 per share, while Yahoo! demanded $37. One of Ballmer's lieutenants suggested that Yang would implement a  poison pill  to make the takeover as difficult as possible, saying ""They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place."" [ 46 ] [ 47 ]   Analysts say that Yahoo!'s shares, which closed at $28.67 on May 2, are likely to drop below $25 and perhaps as low as $20 on May 5, which would put significant pressure on Yang to engineer a turnaround of the company. Some suggest that institutional investors would file lawsuits against Yahoo!'s board of directors for not acting in shareholder interest by refusing Microsoft's offer. [ 48 ] [ 49 ]   On  May 5 ,  2008 , following Microsoft's withdrawal Yahoo!'s stock plunged some 13% lower to $23.02 in Monday trading and trimmed about $6 billion off of its market capitalization. [ 50 ]   After Microsoft's failed bid to acquire Yahoo!, Microsoft is rumored to be looking at acquiring LiveDoor, a leading Japanese portal and the leading blogging service in Japan, to strengthen its position against Yahoo! Japan.   On  June 12 ,  2008 , Yahoo announced that it had ended all talks with Microsoft about purchasing either part of the business (the search advertising business) or all of the company. Talks had taken place the previous weekend (June 8), during which Microsoft allegedly told Yahoo that it was no longer interested in a purchase of the entire company at the price offered earlier -- $33/share. Also on June 12, Yahoo announced a non-exclusive search advertising alliance with Google. [ 51 ]  Upon this announcement, many executives and senior employees have announced their plans to leave the company as it appears that they have lost confidence in Yahoo's strategies. According to market analysts, these pending departures are also impacting  Wall Street 's perception of the company.  [ 52 ]   On  July 7 ,  2008 , Microsoft said it would reconsider proposing another bid for Yahoo if the company's nine directors were ousted at the annual meeting scheduled to be held on  August 1 ,  2008 . Microsoft believes it would be able to better negotiate with a new board. [ 53 ]   Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , calling the current board irrational in its approach to talks with Microsoft, launched a proxy fight to replace Yahoo's board. On July 21, 2008 Yahoo settled with Carl Icahn, agreeing to appoint him and two allies to an expanded board.   On  November 30 ,  2008 , Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo's Search business for $20 billion. [ 54 ]     [ edit ]   Products and services       Main article:  List of Yahoo-owned sites and services       Yahoo! provides a wide array of internet services that cater to most online activities. It operates the web portal  http://www.yahoo.com  which provides contents including the latest news, Yahoo! Finance gives users quick access to other Yahoo! services like  Yahoo! Mail , Yahoo! Maps,  Yahoo! Groups  and  Yahoo! Messenger . The majority of the product offerings are available globally in more than 20 languages.     [ edit ]   Storing personal information   As of  December 11 ,  2007 ,  Google  and the Microsoft's  Live Search  ""store personal information for 18 months"" and Yahoo! and  AOL  ( Time Warner ) ""retain search requests for 13 months"". [ 55 ]     [ edit ]   Communication   Yahoo! provides internet communication services such as  Yahoo! Mail  and  Yahoo! Messenger , Yahoo! Mail is the largest e-mail service in the world with almost half the market share. [ 56 ]  In March, 2007, Yahoo! announced that their email service will offer unlimited storage beginning May 2007. [ 57 ]   Yahoo! Mail premium service MailPlus provides additional functionality including POP/SMTP access to Yahoo! Mail accounts, although such functionality is already provided for free by Yahoo! competitor  Gmail . Some MailPlus subscribers have reported difficulties in successfully cancelling their Mailplus (automatically renewed and paid by credit card) subscriptions. Although other areas of the Mailplus web interface appear to function correctly, a blank page appears when users select ""cancel service"" from the list of options to manage the service. It is unknown whether this error has been an accidental oversight by Yahoo! programmers, or a deliberate attempt to retain Mailplus subscription cash flows as long as possible.   Yahoo! also offers social networking services and user-generated content in products such as My Web,  Yahoo! Personals ,  Yahoo! 360 ,  Flickr  and  Yahoo! Buzz .   Yahoo! Photos was shut down on  September 20 ,  2007  in favor of Flickr. On  October 16 ,  2007 , Yahoo! announced that they will no longer provide support or perform bug fixes on Yahoo! 360 as they intend to abandon it in early 2008 in favor of a ""universal profile"" that will be similar to their Mash experimental system. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Content   Yahoo! partners with hundreds of premier content providers in products such as  Yahoo! Sports ,  Yahoo! Finance ,  Yahoo! Music ,  Yahoo! Movies ,  Yahoo! News ,  Yahoo! Answers  and  Yahoo! Games  to provide media contents and news. Yahoo! also provides a personalization service, My Yahoo!, which enables users to collect their favorite Yahoo! features, content feeds, and information into a single page.   On March 31, 2008 Yahoo! launched web portal  shine.yahoo.com  another Yahoo! property dedicated to women between the ages of 25 and 54. Yahoo! called this demographic underserved by current Yahoo! properties. With  Shine  Yahoo! will expand its offerings in parenting, sex and love, healthy living, food, career, money, entertainment, fashion, beauty home life and astrology.     [ edit ]   Co-branded Internet services   Yahoo! has developed partnerships with different broadband providers such as  AT&T  (via  BellSouth  &  SBC ),  Verizon Communications ,  Rogers Communications  and  British Telecom , offering a range of free and premium Yahoo! content and services to subscribers.     [ edit ]   Mobile   Yahoo! Mobile  includes services for on-the-go messaging, such as email, instant messaging, and  moblogging ; information, such as search and alerts; and fun and games, including ring tones, mobile games, and Yahoo! Photos for camera phones. These require software to be installed on the user's device.     [ edit ]   oneSearch   Yahoo! introduced its Internet search system, called oneSearch, developed for mobile phones on  March 20 ,  2007 . The company's officials stated that in distinction from ordinary Web searches, Yahoo!'s new service presents a list of actual information, which may include: news headlines, images from Yahoo!'s Flickr photos site, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, oneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing a certain movie, user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for Yahoo! oneSearch to start delivering local search results.   The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories. The list of results is based on calculations that Yahoo! computers make on certain information the user is seeking. [ 59 ]   Yahoo! has announced they also plan to adopt  Novarra 's mobile content transcoding service for the  oneSearch  platform. [ 60 ]     [ edit ]   Commerce   Yahoo! offers commerce services such as  Yahoo! Shopping , Yahoo! Autos,  Yahoo! Real Estate  and  Yahoo! Travel , which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. Yahoo! Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.  [ 61 ]     [ edit ]   Small business   Yahoo! provides services such as Yahoo! Domains, Yahoo! Web Hosting, Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, Yahoo! Business Email, and Yahoo! Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo!'s tools.   Yahoo! also offers HotJobs to help recruiters find the talent they seek.     [ edit ]   Advertising   Yahoo! Search Marketing  provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising, and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo! network.  Yahoo! Publisher Network  is an advertising tool for online publishers to place advertisements relevant to their content to monetize their websites. [ 62 ]   Yahoo! launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007 called  Panama . It allows  advertisers  to bid for search terms based on their popularity to display their ads on search results pages. The system takes bids, ad quality,  click-through rates  and other factors into consideration in determining how ads are ranked on search results pages. Through Panama, Yahoo! aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, as well as increase monetization -- to earn more from the ads it shows. [ 63 ]   On April 7, 2008, Yahoo! announced  Yahoo! AMP! , an online advertising management platform. [ 64 ]  The platform seeks to simplify advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service is scheduled for release in quarter 3 of 2008.     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Next   Yahoo! Next  is an incubation ground for future Yahoo! technologies currently in their beta testing phase. It contains  forums  for Yahoo! users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo! technologies.     [ edit ]   Yahoo! BOSS   Yahoo! Search BOSS is a new service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo!'s search technology. [ 65 ]  Early Partners in the program include  Hakia ,  Me.dium ,  Delver  and  Daylife . [ 66 ]     [ edit ]   Revenue model   About 88% of total revenues for the fiscal year 2006 came from marketing services. The largest segment of it comes from search advertising, where advertisers bid for search terms to display their ads on the search results, on average Yahoo! makes 2.5 cents to 3 cents from each search. With the new search advertising system ""Panama"" Yahoo! aims to increase revenue generated from search. [ 67 ]   Other forms of advertising which bring in revenue for Yahoo! include display and contextual advertising.   Working with  comScore ,  The New York Times  found that Yahoo! is able to collect far more data about Web users than its competitors from its Web sites and its advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo! had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. [ 68 ]     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy     [ edit ]   Yahoo! paid inclusion controversy   In  March 2004 , Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites are guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment. [ 69 ]  This scheme is lucrative, but has proved unpopular both with website marketers (who are reluctant to pay), and the public (who are unhappy about the paid-for listings being indistinguishable from other search results). [ 70 ]  As of  October 2006 , Paid Inclusion doesn't guarantee any commercial listing, it only helps the paid inclusion customers, by crawling their site more often and by providing some statistics on the searches that led to the page and some additional smart links (provided by customers as feeds) below the actual url.     [ edit ]   Adware and spyware   Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding  spyware  and  adware   advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor  Walnut Ventures , who had a direct partnership with  Direct Revenue , could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Work in the People's Republic of China          While technologically and financially you [Yahoo] are giants, morally you are pygmies [ 73 ]             Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (2007)         Yahoo!, along with  Google China ,  Microsoft ,  Cisco ,  AOL ,  Skype ,  Nortel  and others, has cooperated with the  Chinese government  in implementing a system of  internet censorship in mainland China .   Unlike  Google  or  Microsoft , which keep confidential records of its users outside mainland China, Yahoo! stated that the company will not protect the privacy and confidentiality of its Chinese customers from the authorities. [ 74 ]   Human rights advocates such as  Human Rights Watch  and media groups such as  Reporters Without Borders  state that it is ""ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor."" [ 75 ]     [ edit ]   Imprisonment of Chinese dissidents     [ edit ]   Shi Tao       Main article:  Shi Tao       In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story. In  April 2005 ,  Shi Tao , a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the  Changsha  Intermediate People's Court of  Hunan Province ,  China  (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia  Democracy  Forum before the anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square Incident . [ 76 ]   The  verdict as published by the Chinese government  stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the Hong Kong subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the  Hunan  newspaper that Shi Tao worked for. Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.   In  February 2006 , Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao. [ 77 ]  In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by  Hong Kong 's  Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data .   On  2 June   2006 , the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ( NUJ ) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China. [ 78 ]   In  July 2007 , evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from  February 22 ,  2004  to present."" [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ]  Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006. [ 82 ]   Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.          It's complicated. [ 73 ]            Michael Callaham, General Counsel, Yahoo!, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee (2007) [ 83 ]           [ edit ]   Li Zhi       Main article:  Li Zhi (dissident)       Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of  dissident  Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting  subversion "".     [ edit ]   Sued in US court for outing Chinese dissident Wang Xiaoning       Main article:  Wang Xiaoning       Wang Xiaoning  is a  Chinese   dissident  from  Shenyang  who was arrested by authorities of the  People's Republic of China  for publishing controversial material online.   In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in  September 2002  after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In  September 2003 , Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison. [ 84 ]   On  April 18 ,  2007 , Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in  San Francisco ,  California ,  United States . [ 85 ]  Wang Xiaoning is named as a  plaintiff  in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the  World Organization for Human Rights USA . ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said  Morton Sklar , executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested."" [ 86 ]   Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in  The Washington Post  and many media sources:     The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in  September 2002 . The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation. [ 86 ]     Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:     In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the  Alien Tort Claims Act , which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the  Founding Fathers  in 1789 for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s. [ 86 ]     On  August 28 ,  2007 , the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ( email  and  IP address ) with the  Chinese government  that caused the  arrests  of writers and  dissidents . The  suit  was filed in  San Francisco  for  journalists ,  Shi Tao , and  Wang Xiaoning . Yahoo! stated that it supported  privacy  and  free expression  for it worked with other technology companies to solve  human rights  concerns. [ 87 ]   On  November 6 ,  2007 , the US congressional panel criticized Yahoo! for not giving full details to the  House Foreign Affairs Committee  the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"". [ 88 ]     [ edit ]   Chatrooms and message boards   As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. [ 89 ]  Yahoo! News' message board section was closed  December 19 ,  2006 , due to the  trolling  phenomenon. [ 90 ]     [ edit ]   Image search   On  May 25 ,  2006 , Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on. This was discovered by a teacher who was intending to use the service with a class to search for ""www"". Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"". [ 91 ]     [ edit ]   Shark finning controversy   Yahoo! is a 40% owner of  Alibaba , which facilitates the sale of  shark-derived products . [ 92 ]  After investing in Alibaba, Yahoo! executives were asked about this issue, and responded: ""We know the sale of shark products is both legal in Asia and a centuries-old tradition. This issue is largely a cultural-practices one."" [ 93 ]  However, the ""cultural"" claim (which is pushed by the trade) [ 94 ]  has been contested.

International             It has been suggested that  Yahoo!Xtra  be  merged  into this article or section. ( Discuss )       Yahoo! is known across the world with its multi-lingual interface. The site is available in over 20 languages, including English. The official directory for all of the Yahoo! International sites is  world.yahoo.com .   Each of the international sites are wholly-owned by Yahoo!, with the exception of Yahoo! Japan 1 , in which it holds a 33% minority stake. Historically, Yahoo! entered into joint venture agreements with  Softbank  for the major European sites 2  (UK, France, Germany) and well as Korea and Japan. In November 2005, Yahoo! purchased the minority interests that Softbank owned in Europe and Korea.     [ edit ]   Yahoo! logo   Yahoo! logos come in many different colors and shapes. [ 97 ]  The first logo was used when the company was founded in 1995; it was red, and it had three icons on each side of it. Even though the official logo is purple, [ 98 ]  the logo used on the main page  yahoo.com  is red with a black outline and shadow. Sometimes the logo is abbreviated with Y!.

For the UK New Wave pop band, see  The Mobiles .             It has been suggested that  Cell phone  be  merged  into this article or section. ( Discuss )                    Several examples of non-flip mobile phones.       A  mobile phone  (also known as a  handphone , [ 1 ]   wireless phone ,  cell phone ,  cellular phone ,  cellular telephone  or  cell telephone ) is a long-range,  electronic device  used for mobile voice or data communication over a network of specialized base stations known as  cell sites . In addition to the standard voice function of a mobile phone,  telephone , current mobile phones may support many additional  services , and  accessories , such as  SMS  for  text messaging ,  email ,  packet switching  for access to the  Internet , gaming,  Bluetooth ,  infrared ,  camera  with video recorder and  MMS  for sending and receiving  photos  and  video ,  MP3 player ,  radio  and  GPS . Most current mobile phones connect to a  cellular network  of  base stations  ( cell sites ), which is in turn interconnected to the  public switched telephone network  ( PSTN ) (the exception is  satellite phones ).

Stubblefield  of  Murray, Kentucky . He applied this patent to ""cave radio"" telephones and not directly to cellular telephony as the term is currently understood. [ 2 ]  Cells for mobile phone base stations were invented in 1947 by  Bell Labs  engineers at  AT&T  and further developed by Bell Labs during the 1960s.  Radiophones  have a long and varied history going back to  Reginald Fessenden 's invention and shore-to-ship demonstration of radio telephony, through the  Second World War  with military use of radio telephony links and civil services in the 1950s, while hand-held cellular radio devices have been available since 1973. A patent for the first wireless phone as we know today was issued in  US Patent Number 3,449,750  to  George Sweigert  of Euclid, Ohio on June 10th, 1969.   In 1945, the zero generation ( 0G ) of mobile telephones was introduced. 0G mobile phones, such as  Mobile Telephone Service , were not cellular, and so did not feature "" handover "" from one base station to the next and reuse of radio frequency channels. [ citation needed ]  Like other technologies of the time, it involved a single, powerful base station covering a wide area, and each telephone would effectively monopolize a channel over that whole area while in use. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology are first described in  U.S. Patent 4,152,647   , issued May 1, 1979 to Charles A. Gladden and Martin H. Parelman, both of  Las Vegas, Nevada  and assigned by them to the United States Government.   This is the first embodiment of all the concepts that formed the basis of the next major step in mobile telephony, the Analog cellular telephone. Concepts covered in this patent (cited in at least 34 other patents) also were later extended to several satellite communication systems. Later updating of the cellular system to a digital system credits this patent.   Martin Cooper , a  Motorola  researcher and executive is widely considered to be the inventor of the first practical mobile phone for handheld use in a non-vehicle setting. Cooper is the inventor named on ""Radio telephone system"" filed on  October 17 ,  1973  with the  US Patent Office  and later issued as US Patent 3,906,166. [ 3 ]  Using a modern, if somewhat heavy portable handset, Cooper made the first call on a handheld mobile phone on April 3, 1973 to a rival, Dr.  Joel S. Engel  of  Bell Labs . [ 4 ]   The first commercial citywide cellular network was launched in Japan by  NTT  in 1979. Fully automatic cellular networks were first introduced in the early to mid 1980s (the  1G  generation). The  Nordic Mobile Telephone  (NMT) system went online in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1981. [ 5 ]   In 1983,  Motorola DynaTAC  was the first approved mobile phone by  FCC  in the United States. In 1984,  Bell Labs  developed modern commercial cellular technology (based, to a large extent, on the Gladden, Parelman Patent), which employed multiple, centrally controlled base stations (cell sites), each providing service to a small area (a cell). The cell sites would be set up such that cells partially overlapped. In a cellular system, a signal between a base station (cell site) and a terminal (phone) only need be strong enough to reach between the two, so the same channel can be used simultaneously for separate conversations in different cells.   Cellular systems required several leaps of technology, including  handover , which allowed a conversation to continue as a mobile phone traveled from cell to cell. This system included variable transmission power in both the base stations and the telephones (controlled by the base stations), which allowed range and cell size to vary. As the system expanded and neared capacity, the ability to reduce transmission power allowed new cells to be added, resulting in more, smaller cells and thus more capacity. The evidence of this growth can still be seen in the many older, tall cell site towers with no antennae on the upper parts of their towers. These sites originally created large cells, and so had their antennae mounted atop high towers; the towers were designed so that as the system expandedand cell sizes shrankthe antennae could be lowered on their original masts to reduce range.   The first ""modern"" network technology on digital 2G (second generation) cellular technology was launched by  Radiolinja  (now part of  Elisa Group ) in 1991 in  Finland  on the GSM standard which also marked the introduction of competition in mobile telecoms when Radiolinja challenged incumbent  Telecom Finland  (now part of  TeliaSonera ) who ran a 1G NMT network.   The first data services appeared on mobile phones starting with person-to-person SMS text messaging in Finland in 1993. First trial payments using a mobile phone to pay for a Coca Cola vending machine were set in Finland in 1998. The first commercial payments were mobile parking trialled in Sweden but first commercially launched in Norway in 1999. The first commercial payment system to mimick banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart. The first content sold to mobile phones was the ringing tone, first launched in 1998 in Finland. The first full internet service on mobile phones was i-Mode introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.   In 2001 the first commercial launch of 3G (Third Generation) was again in Japan by  NTT DoCoMo  on the  WCDMA  standard. [ 6 ]   Until the early 1990s, most mobile phones were too large to be carried in a jacket pocket, so they were typically installed in vehicles as  car phones . With the  miniaturization  of digital components and the development of more sophisticated batteries, mobile phones have become smaller and lighter.   With its use by Nokia as the default ringtone, The Gran Vals by Francisco Tarrega has become arguably the most recognised tune in the world.     Handsets          A Nokia phone with box.       Nokia  is currently the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, with a global device market share of approximately 40% in 2008. Other major mobile phone manufacturers (in order of market share) include  Samsung  (14%),  Motorola  (14%),  Sony Ericsson  (9%) and  LG  (7%). [ 7 ]  These manufacturers account for over 80% of all mobile phones sold and produce phones for sale in most countries.   Other manufacturers include  Apple Inc. ,  Audiovox  (now  UTStarcom ),  Benefon ,  BenQ-Siemens ,  CECT ,  High Tech Computer Corporation (HTC) ,  Fujitsu ,  Kyocera ,  Mitsubishi Electric ,  NEC ,  Neonode ,  Panasonic ,  Palm ,  Matsushita ,  Pantech Wireless Inc. ,  Philips ,  Qualcomm Inc. ,  Research in Motion Ltd.  (RIM),  Sagem ,  Sanyo ,  Sharp ,  Siemens ,  Sendo ,  Sierra Wireless ,  SK Teletech ,  Sonim Technologies , Spice ,  T&A Alcatel ,  Huawei ,  Trium  and  Toshiba . There are also specialist communication systems related to (but distinct from) mobile phones.   There are several categories of mobile phones, from basic phones to feature phones such as musicphones and cameraphones, to smartphones. The first smartphone was the  Nokia 9000 Communicator  in 1996 which incorporated PDA functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturisation and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today. Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM  BlackBerry  focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the Nokia N-Series of multimedia phones; and the Apple  iPhone  which provides full-featured web access and multimedia capabilities.     Features       Main article:  Mobile phone features       Mobile phones often have features beyond sending text messages and making voice calls, including  Internet browsing , music ( MP3 ) playback, memo recording, personal organiser functions,  e-mail , instant messaging, built-in cameras and camcorders,  ringtones , games, radio,  Push-to-Talk  (PTT),  infrared  and  Bluetooth   connectivity , call registers, ability to watch streaming video or download video for later viewing, video calling and serving as a  wireless modem  for a PC, and soon will also serve as a console of sorts to online games and other high quality games. The total value of mobile data services exceeds the value of paid services on the Internet, and was worth 31 billion dollars in 2006 (source Informa). [ citation needed ]  The largest categories of mobile services are music, picture downloads, videogaming, adult entertainment, gambling, video/TV.   Nokia  and the  University of Cambridge  are  showing off  a  bendable  cell phone called  Morph   [ 8 ] .     Applications   The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging, with 74% of all mobile phone users as active users (over 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion total subscribers at the end of 2007). SMS text messaging was worth over 100 billion dollars in annual revenues in 2007 and the worldwide average of messaging use is 2.6 SMS sent per day per person across the whole mobile phone subscriber base. (source Informa 2007). The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.   The other non-SMS data services used by mobile phones were worth 31 Billion dollars in 2007, and were led by mobile music, downloadable logos and pictures, gaming, gambling, adult entertainment and advertising (source: Informa 2007). The first downloadable mobile content was sold to a mobile phone in Finland in 1998, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) introduced the downloadable ringing tone service. In 1999 Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo introduced its mobile internet service, i-Mode, which today is the world's largest mobile internet service and roughly the same size as Google in annual revenues.   The first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000.  Mobile news  services are expanding with many organisations providing ""on-demand"" news services by SMS. Some also provide ""instant"" news pushed out by SMS. Mobile telephony also facilitates  activism  and public journalism being explored by  Reuters  and  Yahoo! [ 9 ]  and small independent news companies such as  Jasmine News  in Sri Lanka.   Companies like  Monster  are starting to offer mobile services such as job search and career advice. Consumer applications are on the rise and include everything from information guides on local activities and events to mobile coupons and discount offers one can use to save money on purchases. Even tools for creating websites for mobile phones are increasingly becoming available.   Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart. Today mobile payments ranging from  mobile banking  to mobile credit cards to mobile commerce are very widely used in Asia and Africa, and in selected European markets. For example in the Philippines it is not unusual to have one's entire paycheck paid to the mobile account. In Kenya the limit of money transfers from one  mobile banking  account to another is one million US dollars. In India paying utility bills with mobile gains a 5% discount. In Estonia the government found criminals collecting cash parking fees, so the government declared that only mobile payments via SMS were valid for parking and today all parking fees in Estonia are handled via mobile and the crime involved in the activity has vanished.   Mobile Applications are developed using the Six M's (previously Five M's) service-development theory created by the author Tomi Ahonen with Joe Barrett of Nokia and Paul Golding of Motorola. The Six M's are Movement (location), Moment (time), Me (personalization), Multi-user (community), Money (payments) and Machines (automation). The Six M's / Five M's theory is widely referenced in the telecoms applications literature and used by most major industry players. The first book to discuss the theory was  Services for UMTS  by Ahonen & Barrett in 2002.   The iPhone has revolutionized applications for mobile phones, allowing a vast array of applications that perform hundreds of different tasks to be easily downloaded and installed through the App Store, a native application on the  iPhone ,  iPhone 3G  and  iPod touch . Using a  WiFi ,  EDGE  or  3G  connection, users can purchase applications (some are free) from the App Store and download them directly to the phone. Apps can also be downloaded from the  iTunes Store  and synced with the iPhone/iPod once the device is synced with  iTunes . The App Store was developed by Apple to interface with the  AT&T  cellular network.  T-Mobile  is also developing their own version of the App Store, most likely to interface with their newest smart phone, the  T-Mobile G1 , the first phone built running the new  Google Android  cellular  firmware , which was likely built as a competitor for the iPhone.     Media   The mobile phone became a mass media channel in 1998 when the first  ringing tones  were sold to mobile phones by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon other media content appeared such as news, videogames, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. In 2006 the total value of mobile phone paid media content exceeded internet paid media content and was worth 31 Billion dollars (source Informa 2007). The value of music on phones was worth 9.3 Billion dollars in 2007 and gaming was worth over 5 billion dollars in 2007 (source Netsize Guide 2008  [ 10 ] ).   The mobile phone is often called the Fourth Screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens as the first three) or Third Screen (counting only TV and PC screens). It is also called the  Seventh of the Mass Media  (with Print, Recordings, Cinema, Radio, TV and Internet the first six). Most early content for mobile tended to be copies of legacy media, such as the banner advertisement or the TV news highlight video clip. Recently unique content for mobile has been emerging, from the ringing tones and ringback tones in music to ""mobisodes,"" video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.   The advent of media on the mobile phone has also produced the opportunity to identify and track  Alpha Users  or Hubs, the most influential members of any social community. AMF Ventures measured in 2007 the relative accuracy of three mass media, and found that audience measures on mobile were nine times more accurate than on the internet and 90 times more accurate than on TV.

(February 2009)       Mobile  phones  generally obtain power from  batteries , which can be recharged from a  USB  port, from portable batteries, from  mains power  or a  cigarette lighter   socket  in a  car  using an  adapter  (often called  battery charger  or  wall wart ) or from a  solar panel  or a  dynamo  (that can also use a USB port to plug the phone).   Formerly, the most common form of mobile phone batteries were  nickel metal-hydride , as they have a low size and weight.  Lithium-Ion  batteries are sometimes used, as they are lighter and do not have the voltage depression that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers have now switched to using  lithium-Polymer batteries  as opposed to the older  Lithium-Ion , the main advantages of this being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid. Mobile phone manufacturers have been experimenting with alternative power sources, including  solar cells .     SIM card             This section does not  cite  any  references or sources .

(February 2009)           Main article:  Subscriber Identity Module              Typical cellphone  SIM card       In addition to the battery,  GSM  cellphones require a small  microchip , called a Subscriber Identity Module or  SIM Card , to function. Approximately the size of a small  postage stamp , the SIM Card is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit, and (when properly activated) stores the phone's configuration data, and information about the phone itself, such as which calling plan the subscriber is using. When the subscriber removes the SIM Card, it can be re-inserted into another phone and used as normal.   Each SIM Card is activated by use of a unique numerical identifier; once activated, the identifier is locked down and the card is permanently locked in to the activating network. For this reason, most retailers refuse to accept the return of an activated SIM Card.   Those cell phones that do not use a SIM Card have the data programmed in to their memory. This data is accessed by using a special digit sequence to access the ""NAM"" as in ""Name"" or number programming menu. From here, one can add information such as a new number for your phone, new Service Provider numbers, new emergency numbers, change their Authentication Key or A-Key code, and update their Preferred Roaming List or PRL. However, to prevent someone from accidentally disabling their phone or removing it from the network, the Service Provider puts a lock on this data called a Master Subsidiary Lock or MSL.   The MSL also ensures that the Service Provider gets payment for the phone that was purchased or ""leased"". For example, the  Motorola  RAZR V9C costs upwards of CAD $500. You can get one for approximately $200, depending on the carrier. The difference is paid by the customer in the form of a monthly bill. If the carrier did not use a MSL, then they may lose the $300$400 difference that is paid in the monthly bill, since some customers would cancel their service and take the phone to another carrier.   The MSL applies to the SIM only so once the contract has been completed the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Providers MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the US are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers in close proximity to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independant phone vendors.   Having an unlocked phone is extremely useful for travelers due to the high cost of using the MSL Service Providers access when outside the normal coverage areas. It can cost sometimes up to 10 times as much to use a locked phone overseas as in the normal service area, even with discounted rates.   For example, in Jamaica, an AT&T subscriber might pay in excess of US$1.65 per minute for discounted international service while a B-Mobile (Jamaican) customer would pay US$0.20 per minute for the same international service. Some Service Providers focus sales on international sales while others focus on regional sales. For example, the same B-Mobile customer might pay more for local calls but less for international calls than a subscriber to the Jamaican national phone C&W (Cable & Wireless) company. These rate differences are mainly due to currency variations because SIM purchases are made in the local currency. In the US, this type of service competition does not exist because some of the major Service Providers do not offer Pay-As-You-Go services. [Needs Pay-As-You-Go references, rumored T-Mobile,Verizon provide one, AT&T does not as of 12/2008]     Terminology   Further information:  Mobile phone terms across the world     Related non-mobile-phone systems     Car phone     A type of telephone permanently mounted in a  vehicle , these often have more powerful transmitters, an external antenna and loudspeaker for handsfree use. They usually connect to the same networks as regular mobile phones.   Cordless telephone  (portable phone)    Cordless phones are telephones which use one or more radio handsets in place of a wired handset. The handsets connect wirelessly to a base station, which in turn connects to a conventional  land line  for calling. Unlike mobile phones, cordless phones use private base stations (belonging to the land-line subscriber), and which are not shared.   Professional Mobile Radio     Advanced professional mobile radio systems can be very similar to mobile phone systems. Notably, the  IDEN  standard has been used as both a private  trunked radio system  as well as the technology for several large public providers. Similar attempts have even been made to use  TETRA , the European digital PMR standard, to implement public mobile networks.   Radio phone    This is a term which covers radios which could connect into the telephone network. These phones may not be mobile; for example, they may require a  mains  power supply, they may require the assistance of a human operator to set up a  PSTN  phone call.   Satellite phone     This type of phone communicates directly with an  artificial satellite , which in turn relays calls to a base station or another satellite phone. A single satellite can provide coverage to a much greater area than terrestrial base stations. Since satellite phones are costly, their use is typically limited to people in remote areas where no mobile phone coverage exists, such as mountain climbers, mariners in the open sea, and news reporters at disaster sites.

clueweb09-enwp00-87-16083	"                     History of mobile phones          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  deal primarily with the  United States  and do not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .              Mobile phone evolution       This  history of mobile phones  chronicles the development of handheld radio telephone technology from two-way radios in vehicles to handheld cellular phones.   In the beginning, two-way radios (known as  mobile rigs ) were used in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, ambulances, and the like, but were not mobile phones because they were not normally connected to the telephone network. Users could not dial phone numbers from their mobile radios in their vehicles. A large community of mobile radio users, known as the  mobileers , popularized the technology that would eventually give way to the mobile phone. Originally, mobile phones were permanently installed in vehicles, but later versions such as the so-called transportables or ""bag phones"" were equipped with a  cigarette lighter plug  so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either mobile or as  portable  two-way radios. During the early 1940s, Motorola developed a backpacked two-way radio, the  Walkie-Talkie  and later developed a large hand-held two-way radio for the US military. This battery powered ""Handie-Talkie"" (HT) was about the size of a man's forearm.           Contents       1   Early years   2   First generation   3   Second generation   4   Third generation   5   Patents   6   See also   7   Notes   8   References   9   External links               [ edit ]   Early years          Dr. Martin Cooper of Motorola, made the first US analogue mobile phone call on a larger prototype model in 1973.       The first fully automatic mobile phone system, called  MTA  (Mobile Telephone system A), was developed by  Ericsson  and commercially released in Sweden in 1956. This was the first system that didn't require any kind of manual control, but had the disadvantage of a phone weight of 40 kg (90 lb).  MTB , an upgraded version with transistors, weighing 9 kg (20 lb), was introduced in 1965 and used  DTMF  signaling. It had 150 customers in the beginning and 600 when it shut down in 1983.   In December 1947,  Douglas H. Ring  and  W. Rae Young ,  Bell Labs  engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones. [ 1 ]  Philip T. Porter, also of Bell Labs, proposed that the cell towers be at the corners of the hexagons rather than the centers and have directional antennas that would transmit/receive in 3 directions (see picture at right) into 3 adjacent hexagon cells. [ 2 ]   [ 3 ]  The technology did not exist then and the frequencies had not yet been allocated. Cellular technology was undeveloped until the 1960s, when Richard H. Frenkiel and  Joel S. Engel  of Bell Labs developed the electronics.   In Europe, radio telephony was first used on the first-class passenger trains between Berlin and Hamburg in 1926. At the same time, radio telephony was introduced on passenger airplanes for air traffic security. Later radio telephony was introduced on a large scale in German tanks during the  Second World War . After the war German police in the British zone of occupation first used disused tank telephony equipment to run the first radio patrol cars. [ citation needed ]  In all of these cases the service was confined to specialists that were trained to use the equipment. In the early 1950s ships on the Rhine were among the first to use radio telephony with an untrained end customer as a user.   Recognizable mobile phones with direct dialing have existed at least since the  1950s . In the 1954 movie  Sabrina , the businessman Linus Larrabee (played by  Humphrey Bogart ) makes a call from the phone in the back of his limousine.   In 1957, the young radio engineer Leonid Kupriyanovich in Moscow, USSR, made the experimental model of wearable automatic mobile phone (""radiophone""), called him as LK-1, with base station. LK-1 has 3 kg weight, 20-30 km operating distance, and 20-30 hours of battery life (""Nauka i zhizn"", 8, 1957, p. 49, ""Yuniy technik"", 7, 1957, p. 43-44). Leonid Kupriyanovich patented this mobile phone in 1957 (author's certificate  115494, 1.11.1957). The base station, in accordance with author's description, could serve several customers. In 1958, Kupriyanovich made the new experimental ""pocket"" model of mobile phone. This phone has 0,5 kg weight. To serve more customers, Kupriyanovich proposed the device, named him as correllator. (""Nauka i zhizn"", 10, 1958, p.66, ""Technika-molodezhi"", 2, 1959, 18-19)   In 1958 USSR also started the developing of ""Altay"" national civil mobile phone service for cars, based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of Altay system were VNIIS (Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications)and GSPI (State Specialized Project Institute). In 1963 this service started in Moscow and in 1970 Altay service used in USSR for 30 cities. Last upgraded versions of Altay system still in use in some places of Russia as trunking system.   In 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 with base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could to serve 6 customers.   In 1967, each mobile phone had to stay within the cell area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call. This did not provide continuity of automatic telephone service to mobile phones moving through several cell areas. In 1970  Amos E. Joel, Jr. , another Bell Labs engineer, [ 4 ]  invented an automatic ""call  handoff "" system to allow mobile phones to move through several cell areas during a single conversation without loss of conversation.   In December 1971, AT&T submitted a proposal for cellular service to the  Federal Communications Commission  (FCC). After years of hearings, the FCC approved the proposal in 1982 for Advanced Mobile Phone Service ( AMPS ) and allocated frequencies in the 824-894 MHz band. [ 5 ]  Analog AMPS was superseded by  Digital AMPS  in 1990.   One of the first truly successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the  ARP  network in  Finland , launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a  zero generation  ( 0G ) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.   On  April 3 ,  1973 ,  Motorola  employee  Dr. Martin Cooper  placed a call to a rival, Dr.  Joel S. Engel , head of research at  AT&T 's  Bell Labs , while walking the streets of  New York City  talking on the first  Motorola DynaTAC  prototype in front of reporters.  Motorola has a long history of making automotive radio, especially two-way radios for  taxicabs  and police cruisers.    In  1978 , Bell Labs launched a trial of first commercial  cellular network  in Chicago using  AMPS   [1] .     [ edit ]   First generation       Main article:  1G       The first commercial launch of cellular telecoms was launched by NET in Tokyo Japan in 1979. In 1981 the NMT system was launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The first handheld mobile phone in the US market was the  Motorola_Dyna 8000X , which received approval in  1983 . Mobile phones began to proliferate through the  1980s  with the introduction of ""cellular"" phones based on  cellular networks  with multiple base stations located relatively close to each other, and protocols for the automated ""handover"" between two cells when a phone moved from one cell to the other. At this time  analog  transmission was in use in all systems. Mobile phones were somewhat larger than current ones, and at first, all were designed for permanent installation in vehicles (hence the term car phone). Soon, some of these bulky units were converted for use as ""transportable"" phones the size of a briefcase. Motorola introduced the first truly portable, hand held phone. These systems ( NIT ,  AMPS ,  SACS ,  RT MI ,  C-Net , and  Radio com 2000 ) later became known as  first generation  ( 1G ) mobile phones.     [ edit ]   Second generation       Main articles:  2G ,  2.5G , and  2.75G              A 1991 GSM mobile phone       In the 1990s, ' second generation'  ( 2G ) mobile phone systems such as  GSM ,  IS-136  ("" TDMA ""),  iDEN  and  IS-95  ("" CDMA "") began to be introduced. In  1991  the first GSM network ( Radiolinja ) opened in  Finland . 2G phone systems were characterized by digital circuit switched transmission and the introduction of advanced and fast phone to network signaling. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher though with some overlap, for example the 900 MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe and so such 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for 2G systems. In America the  IS-54  standard was deployed in the same band as  AMPS  and displaced some of the existing analog channels.   Coinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger ""brickle"" phones toward tiny 100200g hand-held devices, which soon became the norm. This change was possible through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also was largely related to the higher density of cellular sites caused by increasing usage levels which decreased the demand for high transmit powers to reach distant towers for customers to be satisfied.   The second generation introduced a new variant to communication, as  SMS  text messaging became possible, initially on GSM networks and eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK in 1991. The first person-to-person SMS text message was sent in Finland in 1993. Soon SMS became the communication method of preference for the youth. Today in many advanced markets the general public prefers sending text messages to placing voice calls.   2G also introduced the ability to consume media content on mobile phones, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) in Finland introduced the downloadable ringing tone as paid content. Finland was also the first country where advertising appeared on the mobile phone when a free daily news headline service on SMS text messaging was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.     [ edit ]   Third generation       Main article:  3G       Not long after the introduction of  2G  networks, projects began to develop third generation  (3G)  systems. Inevitably there were many different standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies. Quite differently from 2G systems, however, the meaning of 3G has been standardized in the IMT-2000 standardization processing. This process did not standardize on a technology, but rather on a set of requirements (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example). At that point, the vision of a single unified worldwide standard broke down and several different standards have been introduced.   The first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on October 1, 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the USA. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). In March the first European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by the Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further 8 commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.   During the development of  3G  systems,  2.5G  systems such as  CDMA2000 1x  and  GPRS  were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the  EDGE  system which in theory covers the requirements for  3G  system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.   By the end of 2007 there were 295 Million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these are on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over 120 Billion dollars of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation. Earlier in the decade there were doubts about whether 3G might happen, and also whether 3G might become a commercial success. By the end of 2007 it had become clear that 3G was a reality and was clearly on the path to become a profitable venture.   Live streaming of radio and television  [2]  to 3G handsets is one future direction for the industry, with companies from  RealNetworks   [3]  and  Disney   [4]  recently announcing services.

Knowing the differences between cell phone and cell phone plans will save you time and money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Types of Cell Phones:   Camera Cell Phone   PDA Cell Phone    GPS Cell Phone The cell phone itself is not an ongoing expensive. Its a one off purchase that should last in good working order until you want to upgrade. Your own personal tastes and styles should determine what cell phone you want (not the sales assistant behind the desk). Many phones on todays market have a built in camera. The camera phone is by far the most popular phone for its multifunction use. Not only can you capture that perfect photo you can also send pictures to friends and family or upload to your PC. Many of the camera phones have a zoom in/out option and a rotating lens.  Personal Digital Assistant or PDA cell phones are generally the most expensive of the range. This type of phone has specifications similar to that of the PC. The have their own processor and memory and even have the excellent TFT display. This type of phone is ideal for sales reps or people who like to work from different locations apart from the office. This phone has word processor capabilities.  Global Positioning System or GPS cell phones are proving more and more popular. The newest on the market between the different cell phone types. Many companies who issue company mobile phones especially to sales reps or drivers are diverting to the GPS cell type. The type of phone will give a precise location and whereabouts to the receiver.  Cell phone plans Cell phone plans are the most important factor when looking to purchase a cell phone for the very first time or changing from one network to another. Before you sign up on a plan you need to ask yourself the following questions:   Will the phone be used mainly for calling friends or family?    Is the phone going to be used for business?    Are you allowed your cell phone on during working hours?   Will you need your cell for international calls?    Will you be sending many SMS texts? It is important to be honest with yourself in answering the above questions, if not you will end up the long-term loser. Remember you will more than likely have to sign a one-year contract with the cell phone carrier, if you think things through now it will only save you money and stress.  Do not get taken in from carriers offering you a certain amount of free texts per month. The calls themselves are the expense.  Watch out for the roaming rates Watch out for the roaming charges. If you intend to travel from state to state or one country to another different carriers have different rates. The can vary dramatically, be warned. What about the prepaid cell phones? If you find that you intend using the phone only a minimal amount of time, you should consider a prepaid cell phone. The pre paid option is more expensive per minute during use but it has its own advantages such as:   No contract to be signed   No monthly line rental   No service fee   No credit checks    No deposit required   No penalties if you decide never to use it again as you have no contract to begin with.   Many people think that you cannot get a prepaid cell phone with built in camera. This is incorrect as many carriers are offering the prepaid phones that are camera mounted. Be careful, sending pictures by text with a prepaid cell to friends or family is much more expensive than with a bill phone. With the prepaid option you know exactly what you are spending at all times. Ideal for those who are on a tight budget. Where do I get credit for my prepaid cell phone? Its very easy. You can top up your credit in most stores. Just tell the assistant what carrier you are with and how much you need to top up for with credit. Many stores have vending machines where you operate the top up yourself. You can also call your cell phone carriers with your credit card and top up from your own home. Always choose a carrier that has a free toll number. There is nothing more annoying than a carrier charging its own customers for phone calls.

Cell phone chat screen    Sending text messages is something from the past, chat rooms are now being integrated into mobile phones or cell phones.    You can interact with people who share similar interests, enabling you to make new friends fast and easy. There are cell phone chat rooms based on different topics and everyone can get involved, everything you write will be seen by the users inside that particular room. All of the conversations are public so everyone will get a word in.   This new idea is going to grow in popularity amongst the users of cellphone chat rooms and has already been used by actors and politicians worldwide.   Johnny Hallyday has used the mobile phone chat rooms to be able to speak with some of his fans, 1000's of members were online at the time. Some politicians have also used the service before elections to come closer and answer questions from the open public.   Although this is useful for many adults it has been surveyed that 45% of people using the service are between the age of 13 and 17, many parents do not supervise their childrens discussions. Parents should learn the basics of this technology so that they can supervise their children for the reason we all know. Many chat rooms have been hunting grounds for pedophiles in the past, parents should be aware of the danger and check the chatting history of their children which can easily be done. Unlike computers the history can not be erased so all discussions that take place are recorded on the phone's memory.   Many people now wonder how safe chatting on their cell phones will be, it has been said that as a safety measure moderators will work around the clock and profanity filters will be installed which will reduce but not erase the risk for younger children.   There are approximately 10 million users that use the chat rooms on their cell phones at this time.    Many people enjoy it while others insist on saying that it is nothing but problems. Many married couples report that their relationship has been ruined because of it. People have been using it mostly for flirting and setting up sexual encounters, even going to the point of sending pictures of themselves naked to strangers.

In April 1994, ""Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web"" was renamed ""Yahoo!"", for which the official expansion is ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle"". [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  Filo and Yang said they selected the name because they liked the word's general definition, which comes from  Gulliver's Travels  by  Jonathan Swift : ""rude, unsophisticated and uncouth"". [ 12 ]  Its  URL  was akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo. [ 13 ]   By the end of 1994, Yahoo! had already received one million hits. The Yahoo! domain was created on January 18, 1995. [ 14 ]  Yang and Filo realized their website had massive business potential, and on  March 1 ,  1995 , Yahoo! was  incorporated . [ 15 ]  On  April 5 ,  1995 ,  Michael Moritz  of  Sequoia Capital  provided Yahoo! with two rounds of venture capital, raising approximately $3 million. [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  On  April 12 ,  1996 , Yahoo! had its  initial public offering , raising $33.8 million, by selling 2.6 million shares at $13 each.   Like many  search engines  and  web directories , Yahoo! diversified into a  Web portal . In the late 1990s, Yahoo!,  MSN ,  Lycos ,  Excite  and other Web portals were growing rapidly. Web portal providers rushed to acquire companies to expand their range of services, in the hope of increasing the time a user stays at the portal.   On  March 8 ,  1997 , Yahoo! acquired online communications company Four11. Four11's webmail service,  Rocketmail , became  Yahoo! Mail . Yahoo! also acquired ClassicGames.com and turned it into  Yahoo! Games . Yahoo! then acquired direct marketing company Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. on October 12. On  March 8 ,  1998 , Yahoo! launched Yahoo! Pager, [ 18 ]  an instant messaging service that was renamed  Yahoo! Messenger  a year later. On  January 28 ,  1999 , Yahoo! acquired web hosting provider  GeoCities . Another company Yahoo! acquired was  eGroups , which became  Yahoo! Groups  after the acquisition on  June 28 ,  2000 .   When acquiring companies, Yahoo! often changed the relevant  terms of service . For example, they claimed  intellectual property  rights for content on their  servers , unlike the companies they acquired. As a result, many of the  acquisitions  were controversial and unpopular with users of the existing services. [ clarification needed ]          Yahoo! headquarters in Sunnyvale         Dot-com bubble (20002001)   Yahoo! stock doubled in price in the last month of 1999. [ 19 ]  On  January 3 ,  2000 , at the height of the  Dot-com boom , Yahoo! stocks closed at an all-time high of $118.75 a share. Sixteen days later, shares in  Yahoo! Japan  became the first stocks in Japanese history to trade at over 100,000,000, reaching a price of 101.4 million ($94,780 at that time). [ 20 ]   On  February 7 ,  2000 , the Yahoo! domain was brought to a halt for a few hours as it was the victim of a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ). [ 21 ]  On the next day, its shares rose about $16, or 4.5 percent as the failure was blamed on  hackers  rather than on an internal  glitch , unlike a fault with  eBay  earlier that year.   During the dot-com boom, the cable news station  CNBC  also reported that Yahoo! and  eBay  were discussing a 50/50  merger . [ 22 ]  Although the merger never materialized the two companies decided to form a marketing/advertising alliance six years later in 2006. [ 23 ]   On  June 26 ,  2000 , Yahoo! and  Google  signed an agreement which retained Google as the default world-wide-web search engine for Yahoo! following a beta trial in 1999. [ 24 ]     Post dot-com bubble (20022009)   Yahoo! was one of the few surviving large Internet companies after the  dot-com bubble  burst. Nevertheless, on  September 26 ,  2001 , Yahoo! stocks closed at a five-year low of $4.06 (split-adjusted).   Yahoo! formed partnerships with  telecommunications  and Internet providers to create content-rich  broadband  services to compete with  AOL . On  June 3 ,  2002 ,  SBC  and Yahoo! launched a national co-branded  dial  service. [ 25 ]  In July 2003,  BT  Openworld announced an alliance with Yahoo!. [ 26 ]  On  August 23 ,  2005 , Yahoo! and  Verizon  launched an integrated  DSL  service. [ 27 ]   In late 2002, Yahoo! began to bolster its search services by acquiring other search engines. In December 2002, Yahoo! acquired  Inktomi . In February 2005, Yahoo! acquired Konfabulator and rebranded it  Yahoo! Widgets , [ 28 ]  a desktop application and in July 2003, it acquired  Overture Services, Inc.  and its subsidiaries  AltaVista  and  AlltheWeb . On  February 18 ,  2004 , Yahoo! dropped Google-powered results and returned to using its own technology to provide search results.   In 2004, in response to  Google 's release of  Gmail , Yahoo! upgraded the storage of all free Yahoo! Mail accounts from 4  MB  to 1 GB, and all Yahoo! Mail Plus accounts to 2 GB. On  July 9 ,  2004 , Yahoo! acquired e-mail provider  Oddpost  to add an  Ajax  interface to  Yahoo! Mail . [ 29 ]  On  October 13 ,  2005 , Yahoo! and Microsoft announced that  Yahoo! Messenger  and  MSN Messenger  would become interoperable. In 2007, Yahoo! took out the storage meters, thus allowing users unlimited storage.   Yahoo! continued acquiring companies to expand its range of services, particularly  Web 2.0  services. Yahoo! Launchcast became  Yahoo! Music  on  February 9 ,  2005 . On  March 20 ,  2005 , Yahoo! purchased photo sharing service  Flickr . [ 30 ]  On  March 29 ,  2005 , the company launched its blogging and social networking service  Yahoo! 360 . In June 2005, Yahoo! acquired  blo.gs , a service based on RSS feed aggregation. Yahoo! then bought online social event calendar  Upcoming.org  on  October 4 ,  2005 . Yahoo! acquired social bookmark site  del.icio.us  on  December 9 ,  2005  and then playlist sharing community  webjay  on  January 9 ,  2006 .   On  August 27 ,  2007 , Yahoo! released a new version of  Yahoo! Mail . It adds Yahoo! Messenger integration. (which includes Windows Live Messenger due to the networks'  federation ) and free text messages (not necessarily free to the receiver) to mobile phones in the  U.S. ,  Canada ,  India  and the  Philippines . [ 31 ]   On  January 29 ,  2008 , Yahoo! announced that the company was laying off 1,000 employees as the company had suffered severely in its inability to effectively compete with industry search leader  Google . The cuts represent 7 percent of the company's workforce of 14,300. Employees are being invited to apply for an unknown number of new positions that are expected to open as the company expands areas that promise faster growth. [ 32 ]   In February, 2008, Yahoo! acquired  Cambridge, Massachusetts -based Maven Networks, a supplier of internet video players and video advertising tools, for approx. $160 million.   Yahoo! announced on  November 17 ,  2008  that Yang would be stepping down as CEO. [ 33 ]   On  December 10 ,  2008 , Yahoo! began laying off 1,520 employees around the world as the company tries to deal with its financial difficulties. [ 34 ]     Acquisition attempt by Microsoft   Microsoft  and Yahoo! pursued  merger  discussions in 2005, 2006, and 2007, that were all ultimately unsuccessful. At the time, analysts were skeptical about the wisdom of a business combination. [ 35 ] [ 36 ]   On  February 1 ,  2008 , after its friendly takeover offer was rebuffed by Yahoo!, Microsoft made an unsolicited  takeover  bid to buy Yahoo! for US$44.6 billion in cash and stock. [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  Days later, Yahoo! considered alternatives to the merger with Microsoft, including a merger with internet giant  Google [ 39 ]  or a potential transaction with  News Corp . [ 40 ]  However, on  February 11 ,  2008 , Yahoo! decided to reject Microsoft's offer as ""substantially undervaluing"" Yahoo!'s brand, audience, investments, and growth prospects. [ 41 ]  As of February 22, two Detroit based pension companies have sued Yahoo! and their board of directors for breaching their duty to shareholders by opposing Microsoft's takeover bid and pursuing ""value destructive"" third-party deals. [ 42 ] [ dead link ]  In early March, Google CEO  Eric Schmidt  went on record saying that he was concerned that a potential Microsoft-Yahoo! merger might hurt the Internet by compromising its openness. [ 43 ]  The value of Microsoft's cash and stock offer declined with Microsoft's stock price, falling to $42.2 billion by April 4. [ 44 ]  On April 5, Microsoft CEO  Steve Ballmer  sent a letter to Yahoo!'s board of directors stating that if within three weeks they had not accepted the deal, Microsoft would approach shareholders directly in hopes of a electing a new board and moving forward with merger talks; this is known as a  hostile takeover . [ 45 ] [ dead link ]  In response, Yahoo! stated on April 7 that they were not against a merger, but that they wanted a better offer. In addition, they stated that Microsoft's ""aggressive"" approach was worsening their relationship and the chances of a ""friendly"" merger. [ 46 ]  Later the same day, Yahoo! stated that the original $45 billion offer was not acceptable. [ 46 ]  Following this, there has been considerable discussion of having  Time Warner 's  AOL  and Yahoo! merge, instead of the originally proposed Microsoft deal. [ 47 ]   On  May 3 ,  2008 , Microsoft withdrew their offer. During a meeting between Ballmer and Yang, Microsoft had offered to raise its offer by $5 billion to $33 per share, while Yahoo! demanded $37. One of Ballmer's lieutenants suggested that Yang would implement a  poison pill  to make the takeover as difficult as possible, saying ""They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place."" [ 48 ] [ 49 ]   Analysts say that Yahoo!'s shares, which closed at $28.67 on May 2, are likely to drop below $25 and perhaps as low as $20 on May 5, which would put significant pressure on Yang to engineer a turnaround of the company. Some suggest that institutional investors would file lawsuits against Yahoo!'s board of directors for not acting in shareholder interest by refusing Microsoft's offer. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]   On  May 5 ,  2008 , following Microsoft's withdrawal Yahoo!'s stock plunged some 13% lower to $23.02 in Monday trading and trimmed about $6 billion off of its market capitalization. [ 52 ]   After Microsoft's failed bid to acquire Yahoo!, Microsoft is rumored to be looking at acquiring LiveDoor, a leading Japanese portal and the leading blogging service in Japan, to strengthen its position against Yahoo! Japan.   On  June 12 ,  2008 , Yahoo announced that it had ended all talks with Microsoft about purchasing either part of the business (the search advertising business) or all of the company. Talks had taken place the previous weekend (June 8), during which Microsoft allegedly told Yahoo that it was no longer interested in a purchase of the entire company at the price offered earlier -- $33/share. Also on June 12, Yahoo announced a non-exclusive search advertising alliance with Google. [ 53 ]  Upon this announcement, many executives and senior employees have announced their plans to leave the company as it appears that they have lost confidence in Yahoo's strategies. According to market analysts, these pending departures are also impacting  Wall Street 's perception of the company.  [ 54 ]   On  July 7 ,  2008 , Microsoft said it would reconsider proposing another bid for Yahoo if the company's nine directors were ousted at the annual meeting scheduled to be held on  August 1 ,  2008 . Microsoft believes it would be able to better negotiate with a new board. [ 55 ]   Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , calling the current board irrational in its approach to talks with Microsoft, launched a proxy fight to replace Yahoo's board. On July 21, 2008 Yahoo settled with Carl Icahn, agreeing to appoint him and two allies to an expanded board.   On  November 30 ,  2008 , Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo's Search business for $20 billion. [ 56 ]     Products and services   Main article:  List of Yahoo-owned sites and services   Yahoo! provides a wide array of internet services that cater to most online activities. It operates the web portal  http://www.yahoo.com  which provides content including the latest news, Yahoo! Finance gives users quick access to other Yahoo! services like  Yahoo! Mail , Yahoo! Maps,  Yahoo! Groups  and  Yahoo! Messenger . The majority of the product offerings are available globally in more than 20 languages.     Storing personal information   As of  December 11 ,  2007 ,  Google  and the Microsoft's  Live Search  ""store personal information for 18 months"" and Yahoo! and  AOL  ( Time Warner ) ""retain search requests for 13 months"". [ 57 ]     Communication   Yahoo! provides internet communication services such as  Yahoo! Mail  and  Yahoo! Messenger , Yahoo! Mail is the largest e-mail service in the world with almost half the market share. [ 58 ]  In March, 2007, Yahoo! announced that their email service will offer unlimited storage beginning May 2007. [ 59 ]   Yahoo! Mail premium service MailPlus provides additional functionality including POP/SMTP access to Yahoo! Mail accounts, although such functionality is already provided for free by Yahoo! competitor  Gmail . Some MailPlus subscribers have reported difficulties in successfully cancelling their Mailplus (automatically renewed and paid by credit card) subscriptions. Although other areas of the Mailplus web interface appear to function correctly, a blank page appears when users select ""cancel service"" from the list of options to manage the service. It is unknown whether this error has been an accidental oversight by Yahoo! programmers, or a deliberate attempt to retain Mailplus subscription cash flows as long as possible.   Yahoo! also offers social networking services and user-generated content in products such as My Web,  Yahoo! Personals ,  Yahoo! 360 ,  Flickr  and  Yahoo! Buzz .   Yahoo! Photos was shut down on  September 20 ,  2007  in favor of Flickr. On  October 16 ,  2007 , Yahoo! announced that they will no longer provide support or perform bug fixes on Yahoo! 360 as they intend to abandon it in early 2008 in favor of a ""universal profile"" that will be similar to their Mash experimental system. [ 60 ]     Content   Yahoo! partners with hundreds of premier content providers in products such as  Yahoo! Sports ,  Yahoo! Finance ,  Yahoo! Music ,  Yahoo! Movies ,  Yahoo! News ,  Yahoo! Answers  and  Yahoo! Games  to provide media contents and news. Yahoo! also provides a personalization service, My Yahoo!, which enables users to collect their favorite Yahoo! features, content feeds, and information into a single page.   On March 31, 2008 Yahoo! launched web portal  shine.yahoo.com  another Yahoo! property dedicated to women between the ages of 25 and 54. Yahoo! called this demographic underserved by current Yahoo! properties. With  Shine  Yahoo! will expand its offerings in parenting, sex and love, healthy living, food, career, money, entertainment, fashion, beauty home life and astrology.     Co-branded Internet services   Yahoo! has developed partnerships with different broadband providers such as  AT&T  (via  BellSouth  &  SBC ),  Verizon Communications ,  Rogers Communications  and  British Telecom , offering a range of free and premium Yahoo! content and services to subscribers.     Mobile   Yahoo! Mobile  includes services for on-the-go messaging, such as email, instant messaging, and  moblogging ; information, such as search and alerts; and fun and games, including ring tones, mobile games, and Yahoo! Photos for camera phones. These require software to be installed on the user's device.     oneSearch   Yahoo! introduced its Internet search system, called oneSearch, developed for mobile phones on  March 20 ,  2007 . The company's officials stated that in distinction from ordinary Web searches, Yahoo!'s new service presents a list of actual information, which may include: news headlines, images from Yahoo!'s Flickr photos site, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, oneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing a certain movie, user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for Yahoo! oneSearch to start delivering local search results.   The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories. The list of results is based on calculations that Yahoo! computers make on certain information the user is seeking. [ 61 ]   Yahoo! has announced they also plan to adopt  Novarra 's mobile content transcoding service for the  oneSearch  platform. [ 62 ]     Commerce   Yahoo! offers commerce services such as  Yahoo! Shopping , Yahoo! Autos,  Yahoo! Real Estate  and  Yahoo! Travel , which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. In addition, Yahoo! offers an e-commerce platform called Yahoo! Merchant Solutions (also known as Yahoo! Store) and hosts more Top 500 internet retailers than any other hosted e-commerce solution. Yahoo! Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia.  [ 63 ]     Small business   Yahoo! provides services such as Yahoo! Domains, Yahoo! Web Hosting, Yahoo! Merchant Solutions, Yahoo! Business Email, and Yahoo! Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo!'s tools.   Yahoo! also offers HotJobs to help recruiters find the talent they seek.     Advertising   Yahoo! Search Marketing  provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising, and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo! network.  Yahoo! Publisher Network  is an advertising tool for online publishers to place advertisements relevant to their content to monetize their websites. [ 64 ]   Yahoo! launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007 called  Panama . It allows  advertisers  to bid for search terms based on their popularity to display their ads on search results pages. The system takes bids, ad quality,  click-through rates  and other factors into consideration in determining how ads are ranked on search results pages. Through Panama, Yahoo! aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, as well as increase monetization -- to earn more from the ads it shows. [ 65 ]   On April 7, 2008, Yahoo! announced  Yahoo! AMP! , an online advertising management platform. [ 66 ]  The platform seeks to simplify advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. The service is scheduled for release in quarter 3 of 2008.     Yahoo! Next   Yahoo! Next  is an incubation ground for future Yahoo! technologies currently in their beta testing phase. It contains  forums  for Yahoo! users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo! technologies.     Yahoo! BOSS   Yahoo! Search BOSS is a new service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo!'s search technology. [ 67 ]  Early Partners in the program include  Hakia ,  Me.dium ,  Delver  and  Daylife . [ 68 ]     Revenue model   About 88% of total revenues for the fiscal year 2006 came from marketing services. The largest segment of it comes from search advertising, where advertisers bid for search terms to display their ads on the search results, on average Yahoo! makes 2.5 cents to 3 cents from each search. With the new search advertising system ""Panama"" Yahoo! aims to increase revenue generated from search. [ 69 ]   Other forms of advertising which bring in revenue for Yahoo! include display and contextual advertising.   Working with  comScore ,  The New York Times  found that Yahoo! is able to collect far more data about Web users than its competitors from its Web sites and its advertising network. By one measure, on average Yahoo! had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. [ 70 ]     Criticism and controversy     Yahoo! paid inclusion controversy   In  March 2004 , Yahoo! launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites are guaranteed listings on the Yahoo! search engine after payment. [ 71 ]  This scheme is lucrative, but has proved unpopular both with website marketers (who are reluctant to pay), and the public (who are unhappy about the paid-for listings being indistinguishable from other search results). [ 72 ]  As of  October 2006 , Paid Inclusion doesn't guarantee any commercial listing, it only helps the paid inclusion customers, by crawling their site more often and by providing some statistics on the searches that led to the page and some additional smart links (provided by customers as feeds) below the actual url.     Adware and spyware   Yahoo! has also been criticized for funding  spyware  and  adware   advertising from Yahoo!'s clients often appears on-screen in pop-ups generated from adware that a user may have installed on their computer without realizing it by accepting online offers to download software to fix computer clocks or improve computer security, add browser enhancements, etc. The frequency of advertising pop-ups for spyware, generated from a partnership with advertising distributor  Walnut Ventures , who had a direct partnership with  Direct Revenue , could be increased or decreased based on Yahoo!'s immediate revenue needs, according to some former employees in Yahoo!'s sales department. [ 73 ] [ 74 ]     Work in the People's Republic of China          While technologically and financially you [Yahoo] are giants, morally you are pygmies [ 75 ]             Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (2007)         Yahoo!, along with  Google China ,  Microsoft ,  Cisco ,  AOL ,  Skype ,  Nortel  and others, has cooperated with the  Chinese government  in implementing a system of  internet censorship in mainland China .   Unlike  Google  or  Microsoft , which keep confidential records of its users outside mainland China, Yahoo! stated that the company will not protect the privacy and confidentiality of its Chinese customers from the authorities. [ 76 ]   Human rights advocates such as  Human Rights Watch  and media groups such as  Reporters Without Borders  state that it is ""ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor."" [ 77 ]     Imprisonment of Chinese dissidents     Shi Tao   Main article:  Shi Tao   In September 2005, Reporters Without Borders reported the following story. In  April 2005 ,  Shi Tao , a journalist working for a Chinese newspaper, was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the  Changsha  Intermediate People's Court of  Hunan Province ,  China  (First trial case no. 29), for ""providing state secrets to foreign entities"". The ""secrets"" were a brief list of censorship orders he sent from a Yahoo! Mail account to the Asia  Democracy  Forum before the anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square Incident . [ 78 ]   The  verdict as published by the Chinese government  stated the following. Shi Tao had sent the email through an anonymous Yahoo! account. Yahoo! Holdings (the Hong Kong subsidiary of Yahoo) told the Chinese government that the IP address used to send the email was registered by the  Hunan  newspaper that Shi Tao worked for. Police went straight to his offices and picked him up.   In  February 2006 , Yahoo! General Counsel submitted a statement to the U.S. Congress in which Yahoo! denied knowing the true nature of the case against Shi Tao. [ 79 ]  In April 2006, Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong) was investigated by  Hong Kong 's  Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data .   On  2 June   2006 , the union representing journalists in the UK and Ireland ( NUJ ) called on its 40,000 members to boycott all Yahoo! Inc. products and services to protest the Internet company's reported actions in China. [ 80 ]   In  July 2007 , evidence surfaced detailing the warrant which the Chinese authorities sent to Yahoo! officials, highlighting ""State Secrets"" as the charge against Shi Tao. The warrant requests ""Email account registration information for huoyan1989@yahoo.com.cn, all login times, corresponding IP addresses, and relevant email content from  February 22 ,  2004  to present."" [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]  Analyst reports and human rights organizations have said that this evidence directly contradicts Yahoo!'s testimony before the U.S. Congress in February 2006. [ 84 ]   Yahoo! contends it must respect the laws of governments in jurisdictions where it is operating.          It's complicated. [ 75 ]            Michael Callaham, General Counsel, Yahoo!, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee (2007) [ 85 ]           Li Zhi   Main article:  Li Zhi (dissident)   Criticism of Yahoo! intensified in February 2006 when Reporters Without Borders released Chinese court documents stating that Yahoo! aided Chinese authorities in the case of  dissident  Li Zhi. In December 2003 Li Zhi was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment for ""inciting  subversion "".     Sued in US court for outing Chinese dissident Wang Xiaoning   Main article:  Wang Xiaoning   Wang Xiaoning  is a  Chinese   dissident  from  Shenyang  who was arrested by authorities of the  People's Republic of China  for publishing controversial material online.   In 2000 and 2001, Wang, who was an engineer by profession, posted electronic journals in a Yahoo! group calling for democratic reform and an end to single-party rule. He was arrested in  September 2002  after Yahoo! assisted Chinese authorities by providing information. In  September 2003 , Wang was convicted of charges of ""incitement to subvert state power"" and sentenced to ten years in prison. [ 86 ]   On  April 18 ,  2007 , Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws in federal court in  San Francisco ,  California ,  United States . [ 87 ]  Wang Xiaoning is named as a  plaintiff  in the Yahoo! suit, which was filed with help from the  World Organization for Human Rights USA . ""Yahoo! is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,'"" said  Morton Sklar , executive director of the group. ""Yahoo! had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested."" [ 88 ]   Yahoo!'s decision to assist China's authoritarian government came as part of a policy of reconciling its services with the Chinese government's policies. This came after China blocked Yahoo! services for a time. As reported in  The Washington Post  and many media sources:     The suit says that in 2001, Wang was using a Yahoo! e-mail account to post anonymous writings to an Internet mailing list. The suit alleges that Yahoo!, under pressure from the Chinese government, blocked that account. Wang set up a new account via Yahoo! and began sending material again; the suit alleges that Yahoo! gave the government information that allowed it to identify and arrest Wang in  September 2002 . The suit says prosecutors in the Chinese courts cited Yahoo!'s cooperation. [ 88 ]     Human rights organizations groups are basing their case on a 217-year-old U.S. law to punish corporations for human rights violations abroad, an effort the Bush administration has opposed:     In recent years, activists working with overseas plaintiffs have sued roughly two dozen businesses under the  Alien Tort Claims Act , which the activists say grants jurisdiction to American courts over acts abroad that violate international norms. Written by the  Founding Fathers  in 1789 for a different purpose, the law was rarely invoked until the 1980s. [ 88 ]     On  August 28 ,  2007 , the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo! for allegedly passing information ( email  and  IP address ) with the  Chinese government  that caused the  arrests  of writers and  dissidents . The  suit  was filed in  San Francisco  for  journalists ,  Shi Tao , and  Wang Xiaoning . Yahoo! stated that it supported  privacy  and  free expression  for it worked with other technology companies to solve  human rights  concerns. [ 89 ]   On  November 6 ,  2007 , the US congressional panel criticized Yahoo! for not giving full details to the  House Foreign Affairs Committee  the previous year, stating it had been ""at best inexcusably negligent"" and at worst ""deceptive"". [ 90 ]     Chatrooms and message boards   As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo!'s ""user created"" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. [ 91 ]  Yahoo! News' message board section was closed  December 19 ,  2006 , due to the  trolling  phenomenon. [ 92 ]     Image search   On  May 25 ,  2006 , Yahoo!'s image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was on.

Yahoo!'s response to this was, ""Yahoo! is aware of this issue and is working to resolve it as quickly as possible"". [ 93 ]     Shark finning controversy   Yahoo! is a 40% owner of  Alibaba , which facilitates the sale of  shark-derived products . [ 94 ]  After investing in Alibaba, Yahoo! executives were asked about this issue, and responded: ""We know the sale of shark products is both legal in Asia and a centuries-old tradition. This issue is largely a cultural-practices one."" [ 95 ]  However, the ""cultural"" claim (which is pushed by the trade) [ 96 ]  has been contested.

For the UK New Wave pop band, see  The Mobiles .                Several examples of non-flip mobile phones.       A  mobile phone  (also known as a  handphone , [ 1 ]   wireless phone ,  cell phone ,  cellular phone ,  cellular telephone  or  cell telephone ) is a long-range,  electronic device  used for mobile voice or data communication over a network of specialized base stations known as  cell sites . In addition to the standard voice function of a mobile phone,  telephone , current mobile phones may support many additional  services , and  accessories , such as  SMS  for  text messaging ,  email ,  packet switching  for access to the  Internet , gaming,  Bluetooth ,  infrared ,  camera  with video recorder and  MMS  for sending and receiving  photos  and  video ,  MP3 player ,  radio  and  GPS . Most current mobile phones connect to a  cellular network  of  base stations  ( cell sites ), which is in turn interconnected to the  public switched telephone network  ( PSTN ) (the exception is  satellite phones ).   A mobile phone proper typically has a  telephone keypad , more advanced devices have a separate key for each letter. Some mobile phones have a  touchscreen .

Stubblefield  of  Murray, Kentucky . He applied this patent to ""cave radio"" telephones and not directly to cellular telephony as the term is currently understood. [ 2 ]  Cells for mobile phone base stations were invented in 1947 by  Bell Labs  engineers at  AT&T  and further developed by Bell Labs during the 1960s.  Radiophones  have a long and varied history going back to  Reginald Fessenden 's invention and shore-to-ship demonstration of radio telephony, through the  Second World War  with military use of radio telephony links and civil services in the 1950s, while hand-held cellular radio devices have been available since 1973. A patent for the first wireless phone as we know today was issued in  US Patent Number 3,449,750  to  George Sweigert  of Euclid, Ohio on June 10, 1969.   In 1945, the zero generation ( 0G ) of mobile telephones was introduced. 0G mobile phones, such as  Mobile Telephone Service , were not cellular, and so did not feature "" handover "" from one base station to the next and reuse of radio frequency channels. [ citation needed ]  Like other technologies of the time, it involved a single, powerful base station covering a wide area, and each telephone would effectively monopolize a channel over that whole area while in use. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology are first described in  U.S. Patent 4,152,647   , issued May 1, 1979 to Charles A. Gladden and Martin H. Parelman, both of  Las Vegas, Nevada  and assigned by them to the United States Government.   This is the first embodiment of all the concepts that formed the basis of the next major step in mobile telephony, the Analog cellular telephone. Concepts covered in this patent (cited in at least 34 other patents) also were later extended to several satellite communication systems. Later updating of the cellular system to a digital system credits this patent.   Martin Cooper , a  Motorola  researcher and executive is widely considered to be the inventor of the first practical mobile phone for handheld use in a non-vehicle setting. Cooper is the inventor named on ""Radio telephone system"" filed on  October 17 ,  1973  with the  US Patent Office  and later issued as US Patent 3,906,166. [ 3 ]  Using a modern, if somewhat heavy portable handset, Cooper made the first call on a handheld mobile phone on April 3, 1973 to a rival, Dr.  Joel S. Engel  of  Bell Labs . [ 4 ]   The first commercial citywide cellular network was launched in Japan by  NTT  in 1979. Fully automatic cellular networks were first introduced in the early to mid 1980s (the  1G  generation). The  Nordic Mobile Telephone  (NMT) system went online in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1981. [ 5 ]   In 1983,  Motorola DynaTAC  was the first approved mobile phone by  FCC  in the United States. In 1984,  Bell Labs  developed modern commercial cellular technology (based, to a large extent, on the Gladden, Parelman Patent), which employed multiple, centrally controlled base stations (cell sites), each providing service to a small area (a cell). The cell sites would be set up such that cells partially overlapped. In a cellular system, a signal between a base station (cell site) and a terminal (phone) only need be strong enough to reach between the two, so the same channel can be used simultaneously for separate conversations in different cells.   Cellular systems required several leaps of technology, including  handover , which allowed a conversation to continue as a mobile phone traveled from cell to cell. This system included variable transmission power in both the base stations and the telephones (controlled by the base stations), which allowed range and cell size to vary. As the system expanded and neared capacity, the ability to reduce transmission power allowed new cells to be added, resulting in more, smaller cells and thus more capacity. The evidence of this growth can still be seen in the many older, tall cell site towers with no antennae on the upper parts of their towers. These sites originally created large cells, and so had their antennae mounted atop high towers; the towers were designed so that as the system expandedand cell sizes shrankthe antennae could be lowered on their original masts to reduce range.   The first ""modern"" network technology on digital 2G (second generation) cellular technology was launched by  Radiolinja  (now part of  Elisa Group ) in 1991 in  Finland  on the GSM standard which also marked the introduction of competition in mobile telecoms when Radiolinja challenged incumbent  Telecom Finland  (now part of  TeliaSonera ) who ran a 1G NMT network.   The first data services appeared on mobile phones starting with person-to-person SMS text messaging in Finland in 1993. First trial payments using a mobile phone to pay for a Coca Cola vending machine were set in Finland in 1998. The first commercial payments were mobile parking trialled in Sweden but first commercially launched in Norway in 1999. The first commercial payment system to mimick banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart. The first content sold to mobile phones was the ringing tone, first launched in 1998 in Finland. The first full internet service on mobile phones was i-Mode introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.   In 2001 the first commercial launch of  3G  (Third Generation) was again in Japan by  NTT DoCoMo  on the  WCDMA  standard. [ 6 ]   Until the early 1990s, most mobile phones were too large to be carried in a jacket pocket, so they were typically installed in vehicles as  car phones . With the  miniaturization  of digital components and the development of more sophisticated batteries, mobile phones have become smaller and lighter.     Handsets          A Nokia phone with box.       Nokia  is currently the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, with a global device market share of approximately 40% in 2008. Other major mobile phone manufacturers (in order of market share) include  Samsung  (14%),  Motorola  (14%),  Sony Ericsson  (9%) and  LG  (7%). [ 7 ]  These manufacturers account for over 80% of all mobile phones sold and produce phones for sale in most countries.   Other manufacturers include  Apple Inc. ,  Audiovox  (now  UTStarcom ),  Benefon ,  BenQ-Siemens ,  CECT ,  High Tech Computer Corporation (HTC) ,  Fujitsu ,  Kyocera ,  Mitsubishi Electric ,  NEC ,  Neonode ,  Panasonic ,  Palm ,  Matsushita ,  Pantech Wireless Inc. ,  Philips ,  Qualcomm Inc. ,  Research in Motion Ltd.  (RIM),  Sagem ,  Sanyo ,  Sharp ,  Siemens ,  Sendo ,  Sierra Wireless ,  SK Teletech ,  Sonim Technologies , Spice ,  T&A Alcatel ,  Huawei ,  Trium  and  Toshiba . There are also specialist communication systems related to (but distinct from) mobile phones.   There are several categories of mobile phones, from basic phones to feature phones such as musicphones and cameraphones, to smartphones. The first smartphone was the  Nokia 9000 Communicator  in 1996 which incorporated PDA functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturisation and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today. Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM  BlackBerry  focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the Nokia N-Series of multimedia phones; and the Apple  iPhone  which provides full-featured web access and multimedia capabilities.     Features   Main articles:  Mobile phone features ,  Smartphone , and  iPhone   Mobile phones often have features beyond sending  text messages  and making  voice calls , including  call registers ,  GPS navigation , music ( MP3 ) and video ( MP4 ) playback,  RDS   radio receiver ,  alarms ,  memo  and document recording,  personal organiser  and  personal digital assistant  functions, ability to watch  streaming video  or download video for later viewing,  video calling ,  built-in  cameras (3.2+  Mpx ) and  camcorders  (video recording), with  autofocus  and flash,  ringtones , games,  PTT ,  memory card reader  (SD),  USB  (2.0),  infrared ,  Bluetooth  (2.0) and  WiFi   connectivity ,  instant messaging , Internet  e-mail  and  browsing  and serving as a  wireless modem  for a PC, and soon will also serve as a console of sorts to online games and other high quality games.   Some phones includes  touchscreen .   The total value of mobile data services exceeds the value of paid services on the Internet, and was worth 31 billion dollars in 2006 (source Informa). [ citation needed ]  The largest categories of mobile services are music, picture downloads, videogaming, adult entertainment, gambling, video/TV.   Nokia  and the  University of Cambridge  are  showing off  a  bendable  cell phone called  Morph . [ 8 ]     Applications          Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007       The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging, with 74% of all mobile phone users as active users (over 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion total subscribers at the end of 2007). SMS text messaging was worth over 100 billion dollars in annual revenues in 2007 and the worldwide average of messaging use is 2.6 SMS sent per day per person across the whole mobile phone subscriber base. (source Informa 2007). The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.   The other non-SMS data services used by mobile phones were worth 31 Billion dollars in 2007, and were led by mobile music, downloadable logos and pictures, gaming, gambling, adult entertainment and advertising (source: Informa 2007). The first downloadable mobile content was sold to a mobile phone in Finland in 1998, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) introduced the downloadable ringing tone service. In 1999 Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo introduced its mobile internet service, i-Mode, which today is the world's largest mobile internet service and roughly the same size as Google in annual revenues.   The first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000.  Mobile news  services are expanding with many organisations providing ""on-demand"" news services by SMS. Some also provide ""instant"" news pushed out by SMS. Mobile telephony also facilitates  activism  and public journalism being explored by  Reuters  and  Yahoo! [ 9 ]  and small independent news companies such as  Jasmine News  in Sri Lanka.   Companies like  Monster.com  are starting to offer mobile services such as job search and career advice. Consumer applications are on the rise and include everything from information guides on local activities and events to mobile coupons and discount offers one can use to save money on purchases. Even tools for creating websites for mobile phones are increasingly becoming available.   Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart. Today mobile payments ranging from  mobile banking  to mobile credit cards to mobile commerce are very widely used in Asia and Africa, and in selected European markets. For example in the Philippines it is not unusual to have one's entire paycheck paid to the mobile account. In Kenya the limit of money transfers from one  mobile banking  account to another is one million US dollars. In India paying utility bills with mobile gains a 5% discount. In Estonia the government found criminals collecting cash parking fees, so the government declared that only mobile payments via SMS were valid for parking and today all parking fees in Estonia are handled via mobile and the crime involved in the activity has vanished.   Mobile Applications are developed using the Six M's (previously Five M's) service-development theory created by the author Tomi Ahonen with Joe Barrett of Nokia and Paul Golding of Motorola. The Six M's are Movement (location), Moment (time), Me (personalization), Multi-user (community), Money (payments) and Machines (automation). The Six M's / Five M's theory is widely referenced in the telecoms applications literature and used by most major industry players. The first book to discuss the theory was  Services for UMTS  by Ahonen & Barrett in 2002.     Media   The mobile phone became a mass media channel in 1998 when the first  ringing tones  were sold to mobile phones by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon other media content appeared such as news, videogames, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. In 2006 the total value of mobile phone paid media content exceeded internet paid media content and was worth 31 Billion dollars (source Informa 2007). The value of music on phones was worth 9.3 Billion dollars in 2007 and gaming was worth over 5 billion dollars in 2007 (source Netsize Guide 2008  [ 10 ] ).   The mobile phone is often called the Fourth Screen (if counting cinema, TV and PC screens as the first three) or Third Screen (counting only TV and PC screens). It is also called the  Seventh of the Mass Media  (with Print, Recordings, Cinema, Radio, TV and Internet the first six). Most early content for mobile tended to be copies of legacy media, such as the banner advertisement or the TV news highlight video clip. Recently unique content for mobile has been emerging, from the ringing tones and ringback tones in music to ""mobisodes,"" video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.   The advent of media on the mobile phone has also produced the opportunity to identify and track  Alpha Users  or Hubs, the most influential members of any social community. AMF Ventures measured in 2007 the relative accuracy of three mass media, and found that audience measures on mobile were nine times more accurate than on the internet and 90 times more accurate than on TV.

(February 2009)       Mobile  phones  generally obtain power from  batteries , which can be recharged from a  USB  port, from portable batteries, from  mains power  or a  cigarette lighter   socket  in a  car  using an  adapter  (often called  battery charger  or  wall wart ) or from a  solar panel  or a  dynamo  (that can also use a USB port to plug the phone).   Formerly, the most common form of mobile phone batteries were  nickel metal-hydride , as they have a low size and weight.  Lithium-Ion  batteries are sometimes used, as they are lighter and do not have the voltage depression that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers have now switched to using  lithium-Polymer batteries  as opposed to the older  Lithium-Ion , the main advantages of this being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid. Mobile phone manufacturers have been experimenting with alternative power sources, including  solar cells .     SIM card             This section  does not  cite  any  references or sources .

(February 2009)       Main article:  Subscriber Identity Module          Typical mobile phone  SIM card       In addition to the battery,  GSM  mobile phones require a small  microchip , called a Subscriber Identity Module or  SIM Card , to function. Approximately the size of a small  postage stamp , the SIM Card is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit, and (when properly activated) stores the phone's configuration data, and information about the phone itself, such as which calling plan the subscriber is using. When the subscriber removes the SIM Card, it can be re-inserted into another phone and used as normal.   Each SIM Card is activated by use of a unique numerical identifier; once activated, the identifier is locked down and the card is permanently locked in to the activating network. For this reason, most retailers refuse to accept the return of an activated SIM Card.   Those cell phones that do not use a SIM Card have the data programmed in to their memory. This data is accessed by using a special digit sequence to access the ""NAM"" as in ""Name"" or number programming menu. From here, one can add information such as a new number for your phone, new Service Provider numbers, new emergency numbers, change their Authentication Key or A-Key code, and update their Preferred Roaming List or PRL. However, to prevent someone from accidentally disabling their phone or removing it from the network, the Service Provider puts a lock on this data called a Master Subsidiary Lock or MSL.   The MSL also ensures that the Service Provider gets payment for the phone that was purchased or ""leased"". For example, the  Motorola  RAZR V9C costs upwards of CAD $500. You can get one for approximately $200, depending on the carrier. The difference is paid by the customer in the form of a monthly bill. If the carrier did not use a MSL, then they may lose the $300$400 difference that is paid in the monthly bill, since some customers would cancel their service and take the phone to another carrier.   The MSL applies to the SIM only so once the contract has been completed the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Providers MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the US are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers in close proximity to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independent phone vendors.   Having an unlocked phone is extremely useful for travelers due to the high cost of using the MSL Service Providers access when outside the normal coverage areas. It can cost sometimes up to 10 times as much to use a locked phone overseas as in the normal service area, even with discounted rates.   For example, in Jamaica, an AT&T subscriber might pay in excess of US$1.65 per minute for discounted international service while a B-Mobile (Jamaican) customer would pay US$0.20 per minute for the same international service. Some Service Providers focus sales on international sales while others focus on regional sales. For example, the same B-Mobile customer might pay more for local calls but less for international calls than a subscriber to the Jamaican national phone C&W (Cable & Wireless) company. These rate differences are mainly due to currency variations because SIM purchases are made in the local currency. In the US, this type of service competition does not exist because some of the major Service Providers do not offer Pay-As-You-Go services. [Needs Pay-As-You-Go references, rumored T-Mobile,Verizon provide one, AT&T does not as of 12/2008]     Terminology     Related non-mobile-phone systems     Car phone     A type of telephone permanently mounted in a  vehicle , these often have more powerful transmitters, an external antenna and loudspeaker for handsfree use. They usually connect to the same networks as regular mobile phones.   Cordless telephone  (portable phone)    Cordless phones are telephones which use one or more radio handsets in place of a wired handset. The handsets connect wirelessly to a base station, which in turn connects to a conventional  land line  for calling. Unlike mobile phones, cordless phones use private base stations (belonging to the land-line subscriber), and which are not shared.   Professional Mobile Radio     Advanced professional mobile radio systems can be very similar to mobile phone systems. Notably, the  IDEN  standard has been used as both a private  trunked radio system  as well as the technology for several large public providers. Similar attempts have even been made to use  TETRA , the European digital PMR standard, to implement public mobile networks.   Radio phone    This is a term which covers radios which could connect into the telephone network. These phones may not be mobile; for example, they may require a  mains  power supply, they may require the assistance of a human operator to set up a  PSTN  phone call.   Satellite phone     This type of phone communicates directly with an  artificial satellite , which in turn relays calls to a base station or another satellite phone. A single satellite can provide coverage to a much greater area than terrestrial base stations. Since satellite phones are costly, their use is typically limited to people in remote areas where no mobile phone coverage exists, such as mountain climbers, mariners in the open sea, and news reporters at disaster sites.       Privacy   Cell phones have numerous privacy issues associated with them, and are regularly used by governments to perform  surveillance .   Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known  multilateration  to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several  cell towers  near the owner of the phone.

Luckily, these soldiers are receiving some assistance from programs like  Cell Phones for Soldiers , a website that allows you to donate a used cell phone.   These phone are then given to another company, ReCellular, which pays the organization for each phone. This money is then donated to help pay down the cell phone bills of those stationed overseas. This is a great way to give a little something back in these very tough times.   Maybe you have been in the market for a new cellular plan and you are considering  prepaid cell phones . Now might be the time to take the plunge instead of re-signing that two-year contract. Now you can donate your old phone instead of just tossing it in the trash and you will know it went to a very good cause.      Filed Under  prepaid cell phones  |  1 Comment                 Prepaid Cell Phone Use Increases in Bad Economy            These days, consumers are scaling back on expenses wherever they can. One such way is to try to  save money on your cell phone bill . Most people still want the convenience of a portable phone, so instead of canceling all together, they are switching to  prepaid cell phones .   As the economy seems to be worsening, companies that offer prepaid wireless service like MetroPCS are thriving.  In the last quarter of 2008, Metro PCS had the highest new subscriptions in the company’s history, with over half a million new users. This is a very big increase and is a result of the changing attitudes of cell phone users.     The company offers flat-rate unlimited calling services with no contract for right around $40 a month and currently has around 5 million people using their service. That’s a decent sized network.    Leap Wireless, the company that owns Cricket, a prepaid service provider, is also thriving and added a good amount of new patrons. These smaller companies are slowly chewing into the larger marketplace, which is always a good thing for the consumer, who should be able to have a large market of fairly-priced products to choose from.   As people become more savvy about the telecommunications business, they begin to see they have options. They do not have to sign a contract and pay for a certain amount of minutes every month–they can pay for what they use as they go.   One addes bonus with prepaid is that there are usually no roaming charges. These companies are still dwarfed by the giants like  Verizon  (which just recently acquired  Alltel ) and  AT&T , the second largest wireless provider in the US, but the market for this kind of service is growing and becoming more common.   Read some of the reasons you should  consider prepaid . (Some source material found  here .)      Filed Under  boost mobile ,   prepaid cell phones  |  Leave a Comment                 T-Mobile Prepaid Cell Phone Plan Details            T-Mobile prepaid cell phones and wireless plans are a good option for the customer who wants T-Mobile cell phone features and quality minus the hassles of a long-term contract. T-Mobile To Go prepaid plans give you all the freedom that prepaid plans have come to be known for–no contract to sign, no credit check to undergo, no early termination fees. Ever.   In addition, you have the added bonus of not having to deal with unpredictable (and often confusing) cell phone bills at the end of the month.   You can choose the handset to use from a variety of well-known cell phone makers like Motorola and Nokia. The popular Motorola Razr V3 can be used on the To Go network. It is a stylish phone with a lot of features great for the modern day user. Another option is the Nokia 2610, which has a basic design perfect for everyday use.   Below, you will find details for both prepaid wireless plans offered by this company.   T-Mobile Pay As You Go plan:   Per Minute Costs -   $10 for 30 minutes of talk time.   $25 for 130 minutes.   $50 for 400 minutes.   $100 for 1000 minutes.   In addition, if you refill $100 or more you get 15% more minutes on all of your refills. Your balance will last for a year. You have no daily charge for this plan.   T-Mobile Pay By the Day Plan:   Per Minute Costs -   Unlimited Nationwide Calling from 7pm to 7am. You also speak to any other T-Mobile user for no charge. For all other domestic calls, you pay 10 cents per minute.   You also have a daily charge of $1.00 which you pay for every day you use your phone. If you are a daily user or talk on your phone frequently, this charge may add up. But you also want to keep in mind that you have unlimited calling between 7 and 7, and you don’t pay for conversations with other T-Mobile numbers.   Which T-Mobile Prepaid Plan Should I Choose?     The answer to this depends on your phone habits. If you talk on your phone a lot between the hours of 7:00 pm and 7:00 am–like for instance if you go out at night a lot or have an active social life–then you may want to consider the Pay By the Day Plan. This may be the cheapest option for you because you will pay a one dollar fee per day, but have unlimited calling during those hours .   Also, if you have friends or family on the same network, you talk for free. This is one of the easiest ways to save money on cell phone bills and many people take advantage of the free in-network minutes. Well, they aren’t exactly free, but you get the idea.   What you need to be careful with this plan is that each additional minute costs ten cents and will add up ridiculously quick during the normal daytime hours when the unlimited nationwide calling isn’t in effect.   If you are a “light” cell phone user, then it may make more sense to go with the Pay As You Go plan and just purchase the amount of minutes you are planning to use and use them sparingly. $50 for 400 minutes is a decent deal–not an amazing one. If you have used a pay as you go service before, you know that you can use up your minutes very fast. On this plan, when you buy minutes they last for 90 days until they expire.   This type of plan is best for people who use their talk time sparingly or strictly for emergency use.   It is hard to make an overall recommendation because every person’s situation is different. The best thing you can do when looking into  prepaid cell phones  is to think about what you need in a wireless plan.   One way to do this is to pull out your cellular phone bills for the last three months and see where you are spending too much money and where you can cut additional costs. Are you paying for too many minutes? Do you fall into the light-user category of less than 200 minutes per month?   Once you identify your habits that stay consistent month to month, then you will have a good idea what you need and what you don’t need. You will notice consistencies and should be able to make a better decision on your prepaid plan.  T-Mobile prepaid  may be an option for you if one of the two plans fits your habits.

The wireless service provider will be raising an administrative fee from $.75 to $.99, which means that you can cancel your contract with no fee. So, if you are not happy with the service or are looking to save money on your phone bill, now might be the time to look into  prepaid cell phones .   Legally, the company has to let you out of the contract. Just be persistent and keep asking. If a company rep gives you a hard time, ask to talk to a manager. Or start yelling!!

Some 47,000 readers tell you how                                                                                                    Last reviewed: January 2008                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Choose your wireless carrier first.                                    Your cell phone choices—and overall satisfaction—will depend on the service provider.                                                                                                                  Cell-phone service seems to stubbornly resist improvement. The Annual Survey of Cell-Phone Service conducted by the Consumer                            Reports National Research Center found that fewer than half of respondents were completely or very satisfied. That makes cell                            service among the lower-rated services we survey, as it has been for the past six years.                                                    Still, there are bright spots. Verizon and Alltel scored better than other providers this year, as they have in the past.                            T-Mobile matched satisfaction rates for Verizon in almost all the cities we surveyed. And T-Mobile plans generally offer more                            for the money than those of Verizon and Alltel.                                                    Meanwhile, cell carriers are getting more consumer-friendly. Last fall, all of our rated service providers pledged to join                            Verizon and prorate their hefty $150 to $200 early-termination fees. Holdouts also said they would join Alltel and T-Mobile                            and end their heavy-handed practice of mandatory contract extensions when you make changes to your service plan.                                                    Mandatory contract extensions were one of the top two complaints of survey respondents, tied with high costs for service.                            More than 60 percent of respondents who made changes to their cell-phone service plan in the past year said they were required                            to extend their contract as part of the deal. That number might understate the problem because some carriers haven't always                            been up front with customers about such extensions, according to allegations in recent legal filings.                                                    In the past five years, consumer advocates such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, in Santa Monica, Calif.,                            and class-action lawyers have filed more than 100 lawsuits coast to coast, according to an analysis by Thomson West, a legal-information-services                            firm. The cases involve issues such as early-termination fees, calculation of airtime, arbitration requirements, class-action                            prohibitions, rebates, and other contract provisions.                                                    One important outcome was a spate of recent court decisions in several states that struck down as ""unconscionable"" cell-phone                            service contract provisions that had forced customers to arbitrate disputes individually and prohibited them from banding                            together into class actions. ""In the last 18 months, there has been a sea change and a run of court decisions favoring consumers,""                            says Paul Bland, staff attorney with Public Justice, a nonprofit public-interest law firm in Washington, D.C., and an expert                            on class-action bans in consumer contracts.                                                    The proposed settlement in another California suit might signal new flexibility about taking your phone with you when you                            switch carriers. Most phones in the U.S. are locked to a specific carrier (see  Wireless carriers lock out consumers ). But Sprint has agreed to provide departing customers with a code that unlocks their phone, with the promise of making it                            usable with other compatible carriers.                                                    Also, in late November  Verizon announced  that it will by the end of 2008 provide customers the option to use, on its nationwide wireless network, wireless devices,                            software and applications offered by other companies which meet Verizon's technical specifications.  Advocates at Consumers Union , the non-profit publisher of  Consumer Reports , said the news was encouraging but  its full impact will not be clear  until more details are available.                                                    Congress has joined in and ratcheted up pressure on the industry with public hearings and the threat of consumer-rights legislation.                            ""People want their cell service to work, they believe it's a necessary part of life, and they don't want to get ripped off,""                            says Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Klobuchar has introduced legislation that would require prorated cell-phone service termination                            fees and public disclosure of the incidence of dropped calls and coverage gaps by location.                                                    Prospects for the bill were unclear as we went to press. But a day before hearings on the legislation in October, AT&T announced                            that it would prorate its fees beginning in early 2008. Other carriers began easing up some restrictions last summer and fall,                            albeit modestly.                                                    Despite such positive developments, you still need to take charge of fixing problems with your cell-phone service. Here are                            some steps to consider:                                                    CELL PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS                           Problem: Poor coverage.  Substandard service quality was the biggest reason our survey respondents switched carriers in the previous three years,                            our survey found.                                                    Solution:  Listen to our readers’ experiences. Alltel and Verizon got high marks across the board for connectivity. T-Mobile had relatively                            high satisfaction scores, but customers experienced problems with lack of service in some cities. Subscribers also highlighted                            problems with AT&T for gaps in service and static, and with Sprint for dropped calls. Check the signal strength down to street                            level in areas where you‘ll use the phone most frequently. Interactive online coverage maps, offered by most carriers except                            Alltel, provide some guidance as to what you can expect.                                                    Problem: Unsatisfactory customer service.  The trouble spots include serious or persistent billing errors,maddening voice-mail menus, and the need to spend lots of                            time and effort yielding little help from customer service.                                                    Solution:  Again, heed the voice of experience—but don’t expect too much. In our survey, Alltel, T-Mobile, and Verizon were the better                            choices in a bad lot for customer service. Only about 40 percent of their customers said these companies were very helpful,                            responding to queries and complaints about service issues—none too impressive. But only 21 percent of Sprint customers said                            the same thing. Sprint made news last summer when it terminated 1,000 subscribers for complaining too much about the service.                            Roni Singleton, a Sprint representative, says, “They were contacting us, in some cases, 100 times per month.We tried to resolve                            their issues, but they were still not satisfied, and it gets to the point where you say these customers may be better off                            somewhere else.”                                                    If customer service isn’t helpful, file a complaint with your state public utility commission or consumer advocate.                           Problem: Early-termination fees.  About one in seven survey respondents said they were seriously considering a switch to a better carrier but were discouraged                            from doing so by penalties that can run as high as $200 per phone line. Termination fees are especially onerous when a carrier                            keeps charging former customers a monthly service fee until they pony up the penalty.                                                    It’s not clear what actual costs such fees are intended to offset. Cellular carriers variously claim that the fees are used                            to recoup handset and rate-plan discounts, unspecified “costs caused by early termination” and “transaction costs,” and even                            the capital investment in their wireless networks.                                                    Scott Poynter, lead counsel in a classaction suit against Alltel, which is based in Arkansas, says the carrier uses those                            fees to ""hold its customers hostage."" He argues that if the fees recover real costs, why has Alltel charged the same $200                            fee if the customer quits 23 days or 23 months into a 24-month contract? Alltel, which is contesting the lawsuit, declined                            to comment. Poynter says the carrier should shrink the fee proportionately as the contract matures. Last fall Alltel, AT&T                            and T-Mobile said they would join Verizon in doing just that. As we went to press, Sprint told us that it planned to announce                            prorated early termination fees in November.                                                    Paul Weiss, lead counsel in class-action suits against Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, says that the industry has collected                            several hundred million dollars in unjust penalties. “This is an enormous profit center for cell companies,” Weiss says.                                                    Solution:  Attack this problem based on your specific circumstances. If you’re near the end of your contract,wait until it runs out                            before quitting the company. If you’re at the very beginning of your contract, take advantage of 14- to 30-day freetrial periods                            offered by the carriers. They allow you to cancel a new account without penalties. After that, try to negotiate a waiver,                            especially if service quality has deteriorated, or you’ve moved to an area the carrier does not serve well or at all, or the                            company has been taken over by another carrier.                                                    You might also consider transferring your contract to someone else by going to  www.celltradeusa.com  or  www.cellswapper.com . For about $15 to $20, you can transfer a contract with the cell carrier’s approval. The person who takes over your phone                            and service becomes responsible for future payments, and you walk away. But remember, if you want to keep your current phone                            number, arrange that with your carrier before the transfer to avoid any potential complications.                                                    Last, consider termination fees when choosing a company in the future. Since November 2006,Verizon has been prorating its                            $175 early-termination fee on its two-year contracts, but only by $5 a month. Even if you cancel the contract just days before                            it concludes, you’ll still be liable for at least $60. Last fall, AT&T and T-mobile announced that they would prorate their                            fees starting in early 2008 but had not determined by how much at press time.                                                    Problem: Mandatory extensions.  In the wake of legal actions, there’s movement on this issue, too, by some carriers. In September, the Minnesota attorney                            general, Lori Swanson, sued Sprint, saying that the company tacked on contract extensions of up to two years without proper                            disclosure or consent when customers made changes to their service plans. After that, AT&T and Verizon announced that they                            would join Alltel and T-Mobile in eliminating contract extensions when customers changed their plan. However, note that switching                            to some special promotional plans or getting a new “free” or discounted phone might still trigger a contract extension.                                                    “In some cases, Sprint extended the contract when customers called to complain or to get new batteries or small repairs for                            the phone,” Swanson says. “So the allegation is consumer fraud.” Sprint denies the charges, but told  Consumer Reports  that it too planned to stop requiring contract extensions for plan changes. In our survey, mandatory contract extensions                            were most frequent among Sprint customers.                                                    Carriers,however, still have other ways to lure you back into a contract term with offers of a sexy new phone or other inducement.                            Verizon, for example, sent direct-mail ads to some customers this year promising one “free” month of service worth $9.99 if                            they renewed their contract for another year; the fine print revealed that the supposed freebie put them back on the hook                            for a $175 early-termination fee.

The trade show is set just before the holidays and usually sees introductions that are headed for the shelves to catch some of that holiday cheer.  The show saw a Euro only  Connected TomTom (740 and 940 LIVE) , while Garmin introduced extensions to their  Nuvi 200 and 700 series by improving the product offerings and adding lifetime traffic capabilities (no subscription required).      This month I also reviewed the  Garmin Oregon 400t  handheld GPS after using it for several weeks, as well as the new  TomTom ONE 130/130S  and  330/330S XL  units.

But our expectations of GPS are that it works accurately, instantly, and reliably on all our devices. That's asking a bit much from what is fundamentally 1990s-era technology.     Fortunately, there's help. Assisted GPS (AGPS) and a variety of complements and supplements to GPS can shrink the wait for a positive fix on a location— the  Time To First Fix  or TTFF—from multiple minutes down to as little as under a second without sacrificing accuracy.     Reducing that wait means that your pictures are instantly tagged with coordinates ( geotagged ), a map drops a pin on your current location before the map itself finishes loading, and a device you're using in a remote location knows right away that it's in the middle of nowhere. Oh, and Google and others can give you the right ads for your location without any tedious waiting on their part, either.     Typically, AGPS systems help a GPS figure out where the satellite signals that the receiver is picking up are located precisely at that moment. Related systems that aren't technically AGPS use a variety of means to combine with, replace, or enhance GPS data into providing a geographic result.     In this article, I'll explain how AGPS and alternatives work, and I'll conclude with a discussion of what's coming in the future for even more precise or esoteric location finding.    GPS basics     The GPS system, run by the US Department of Defense through an Air Force space division, uses a constellation of 32 satellites that each orbit the earth twice per day. A GPS receiver should be able to get signals from about 10 satellites at a time in ideal circumstances, but far fewer can be picked up reliably in most real-world conditions.     All the satellites constantly transmit data—the navigation message—over the same set of frequencies, using an encoding that allows 50 bits per second (really! 50 bps!) for a total of 1,500 bits of data to be demodulated from each satellite each 30 seconds.     On every minute and half-minute, each satellite transmits its notion of the precise time and its health, followed by its location and a path in orbit that's valid for as long as four hours (the  ephemeris , pluralized  ephermerides ). It also transmits a subset of data about the other satellites in orbit, including a rougher position (the  almanac ). It takes 25 navigation messages, all received perfectly over 12.5 minutes, to assemble a full almanac. A timestamp is also included as part of each 300-bit (six-second) segment or sub-frame of the message.     With the timing information and the ephemerides from four satellites, a GPS receiver can perform trilateration, which allows a point to be plotted accurately to within about 5 to 15 meters (15 to 45 feet). Although geometrically only three satellites are needed, atmospheric effects and other issues introduce small errors in timing. A fourth satellite corrects those errors and allows an accurate and corrected time and elevation as well. (Some techniques for assisting or supplementing GPS can avoid the need for a fourth satellite, or even use fragmentary data from two satellites.)    A cold start    From a cold start with typically older GPS receivers—where the receiver has never been turned on, has been off for several weeks, has lost a battery charge, or has been moved a few hundred miles since its last activation—the entire almanac has to be retrieved over 12.5 minutes. And that's outdoors with good overhead visibility. Jean-Michel Rousseau, a staff product manager in  the group at Qualcomm that handles GPS technology , explained that that's ""the maximum time that the user would get a position assuming it had absolutely no knowledge of the GPS constellation.""     While you can still buy certain kinds of standalone GPS devices with this lag—like the  ATP Photo Finder  used for geotagging digital camera images—most modern gear uses techniques to have enough information to avoid this  cold start  problem.     Most chipmakers and manufacturers of standalone GPS hardware now claim about 30 to 60 seconds for a  warm start , with a few exceptions. ""GPS receivers ship with some default almanac data in memory; as a result a receiver no longer has to decode this data off the satellites,"" Rousseau said. Qualcomm's gpsOne, for instance, can fire up in 35 seconds in a device that works in standalone mode, with none of the assistance available that we're about to learn about.                                               < Previous Page  |       Next Page >                                           Filed under:  GPS ,  AGPS ,  Paedia ,  Gadgets                                                                                                                                                       Macworld.Ars: Axiotron unveils improved ModBook, ModBook Pro                   Axiotron CEO Adreas Haas, as well as newly-dubbed Advisory Board member Steve Wozniak, were on hand at the 2009 Macworld Expo to demo Axiotron's new products and the new QuickScript and Project Kopernikus.

As Matt Croydon's  PythonForSeries60  shows, there are an increasing number of interesting projects written using the Python SDK for the Nokia phones.  A  discussion thread  on the Nokia forums shows how to get position data from a Bluetooth GPS, and when combined with recent  Google Maps hacks , gives a simple Google Maps GPS application for the Nokia.  The demo app reads the current latitude / longitude position from a Bluetooth GPS device and converts the coordinates into an x,y map tile reference for Google Maps. After connecting to Google Maps over GPRS or 3G and retrieving the tile, it displays it on the screen.  As the GPS position changes, it pulls in and displays the correct tiles as you travel along your route.  The app is very basic, and suffers from the current method used in Nokia Python for displaying graphics on the phone - it can only display around 32 or so tiles before falling over. When the next release of Python for the Nokia is out, the additional UI and graphical functions should allow other additions such as:  - overlaying current position on map tile  - rotate and centre tiles to current GPS heading  - background downloading of adjacent tiles  - incorporate speed, position, satellites, etc. in UI  You can download the current release from here:  gmap_0_2.py Simply place in the System\Apps\Python folder on your mobile phone, and run from Python. Python for the Nokia Series 60 can be found on  Nokias website A few snapshots of the app in use:                                posted by gpswanderer at  3:41 PM                    63 comments                                                                                  About Me     Name:   gpswanderer       View my complete profile                           Links              Plot your own Google Maps        Python For Series60                Previous Posts                      Embedding Goolge Maps                 Real-time Tracking on Google Maps                 Mobile Google Maps with GPS                     Archives                     April 2005            May 2005

The Palm Pre is a lot smaller than I initially thought it would be. A good size comparison would be an iPod classic with a big hard drive. In terms of thickness, it's definitely not as thin as the iPhone, or even the bold, but it's an acceptable size considering it's a slider.

In light of TouchFLO and its endless competitors, the skin Moto's developed for this thing -- while tasteful and seemingly finger-friendly -- really isn't anything to get terribly excited about, but it does an adequate job of making the superficial surface of Windows Mobile reasonably finger-friendly.

Going with used phones is an excellent idea, but there are a few tips that you should keep in mind when purchasing used cell phones, no matter where you purchase them. Here are a few tips to follow that will help you get the best used cell phones possible. - Tip #1 - Purchase Phones for Your Network - When you are purchasing used cell phones, it is important that you only purchase phones that are designed for your specific network. If you are a member of the Sprint network and you purchase T-mobile phones, you will have a problem. These phones are usually not going to work for another network. So, before you make the final purchase, make sure that you purchase a cell phone that is going to work with the network that you are already with. - Tip #2 - Look Online at Auction Sites for Phones and Accessories - If you are going to purchase used cell phones and accessories, then the best place to look for them is online at auction sites. These sites often offer great deals on used Sprint cell phones, which is really important. No doubt you will find that the prices you can find here are much better than most other places out there, and often you can even bid the price of your choice on the phone that you want. - Tip #3 - You Can Buy at Used Phone Websites - There are websites that specialize in used cell phones where you can purchase these used Sprint phones as well. They offer some great deals, and although you may not get as good of a deal as you could get at an online auction site, you will find that you can a fairly great deal on a nice used phone. - Tip #4 - Find Out About Returns Before Buying - Of course before you decide to purchase used Sprint cell phones, you should take the time to find out about returns and how the company handles them. Look for an address or phone number where you can get in contact with the seller if something goes wrong. Even though you will be purchasing the phone for a discounted price, you do not want to end up paying out good money on a phone that ends up being a dud. So, make sure that you know the return policy before purchasing these used cell phones. Why Buy Used? So, why should you go ahead and purchase cheap used cell phones? Well, there are actually many great reasons to do this. First and foremost, purchasing used phones definitely provides you with the opportunity to save some money, since used phones are a whole lot cheaper than phones that are brand new. You will also find that purchasing used phones allows you to do your part to help save your environment. It is a great method of recycling. Used phones are excellent choices for kids and teens as well, and if you are just looking for a certain phone that they do not make anymore, you may be able to find a used one for sale that you can purchase so you get the phone that you really want.

I was sitting back looking at the list of hot selling units on Amazon's Top 25 list, and was amazed at the opportunities out there.   OK With Refurbished Units?   Some people aren't OK with refurbished units, others think ""Sweet Deal"". If you are the latter, the big huge GPS market is generating more and more refubs for sale, and the prices are insane.       TomTom ONE 3rd Ed  - $89 - Entry level device with Maps of North America. Solid Navigation for under $90 with Free Shipping.      TomTom GO 720  - $159 - Widescreen, Text to Speech, Maps of North America, and Bluetooth handsfree capabilities. Plus has the fun record your own voice for turn prompts feature. Loads of capability priced at cheap entry level pricing.      Magellan Maestro 4250  - $119 - Widescreen, Text to Speech, AAA database - lots of features at an unbelievable price. I rate the Magellans down a bit on their interface vs. the TomTom and Garmins, but if you can deal with it; that's a great price.        Other Great Deals   Don't Want a Refurb, but still want a great deal? Here are a few.       Garmin Nuvi 760  - $249 - Widescreen, advanced routing, Bluetooth Handsfree, and recently dropped from over $300, this is the best deal going these days on a major maker GPS. Sure it's a generation older than the latest units, but there's a lot of capability there, and they still ship with the latest maps.      Garmin Nuvi 270  - $129 - Standard screen, no text to speech would say it's an entry level device, but it comes with Maps of North America and Western Europe. If you are heading to europe and wanted to add those maps to another unit, they would cost $149!!!!!.... amazing deal here.      Mio C320  - $99 - Widescreen navigator with text to speech, it's another amazing deal. The interface is a bit harder to master than the tomTom or Garmin; includes a lot of features.

To make a VoIP call the only additional piece of equipment that you need is an Analog Telephone Adaptor (often called       ATA or gizmo).

They are finding that their monthly telephony costs are reducing by well over 30% in most cases       with a Business VoIP system.                        One of the reasons VoIP service is so compelling to Businesses, of all sizes,      is that all of their telephony needs are met by just expanding their Internet data bandwidth requirements by a small percentage.   With this comes a vast array of additional voice features compared with a regular      PSTN service.                    One VoIP call takes less than 90Kbps of bandwidth (and often considerably less) which is usually a very small overhead on top of a businesses data needs.  Businesses simply send all of their information over       their Broadband Internet connection      whether it be Internet data from PCs or voice calls from their employees.  It all shares the same pipe, which could be DSL or Cable High Speed connection for Small Offices      or T1/T3 cables for medium to larger sized businesses.  No expensive PBX is required and adding or moving voice lines is a trivial task.

In our tests, we evaluate screen size, portability, ease of use, mounting systems, and other                            features. Not one of the GPS navigation systems we've tested is perfect. But a portable GPS system will usually guide you                            to your destination. The highest-rated GPS models make it especially easy to enter destinations and they give the most helpful                            directions.

clueweb09-en0007-21-20615	               GPS Gazette - GPS Reviews                                                           14     Mar        Navigon 7100 and 5100                     Navigon is presenting two brand new  navigation systems  at the CeBIT this year, the Navigon 7100 and 5100. The first impression is that they have a really stylish design. The main difference of the two models is that the Navigon 7100 has a 4.3-inch display (16:9), while screen of the Navigon 5100 is 3.5″. Some of the other features of the two systems include Bluetooth for hands free calling, free traffic information, 2D or 3D map view and voice input. A new function that we will find in these new Navigon systems is called Real View or Reality View which if I understood correctly is a new view mode that will display signposts realistically in a way that will help the user navigate more easily.   The Navigon 7100 is expected in Europe sometime this summer with a price of 450 euros for the version with regional maps and 500 euros for the Europea maps version. Finally the Navigon 5100 will cost 350 euros.     Via  SlashGear                    Posted in  GPS News  by: Dimitris    No Comments                     13     Mar        ViaMichelin X-960 and X-970T                      Viamichelin  announced that they will showcase two new GPS systems at the CeBIT this year, the  ViaMichelin X-960  (picture on the left) and the  ViaMichelin X-970  (picture below). The X-960 will have a 3.5″ touch screen, will be using the SiRFStar III GPS chipset and will be powered by a 300 Mhz Samsung CPU and will be running on Windows CE.net 5.0 with 64 MB of RAM and 128 MB of ROM memory. At first, it will start shipping in Europe like previous ViaMichelin models with a price of 299  (with maps of 20 European countries). Maps will be provided by TeleAtlas and the navigation that the X-960 (and the X-970T) will be equipped with will be ViaMichelin Navigation Version 7.    The main differences between the ViaMichelin X970T and its little brother is that it will be equipped with a more powerful processor (400 Mhz) and will also have an RDS/TMC (as the name suggests) and also will feature bluetooth capabilities for hands free calling. The European model is expected to cost 399 .

After a bit of searching I found that Garmin’s Danish site has already pages for three new  GPS Systems , the  Nuvi 200, 250 and the Nuvi 270 . To be totally honest I can’t seem to find what differences this new line will have from the previous Nuvi systems and autotranslators don’t work that well. If any Danish speaker could help us find out what new features will these new PNDs have, it would be great. Of course we can also wait for the CeBIT that is just around the corner.

Since the most noteworthy feature is its price let’s start from that, it currently retails at  $364.99 from  TigerDirect . As we mentioned it features a 7″ Wide LCD TFT screen and some of its other features include, 512 MB of internal NAND Flash memory, turn-by-turn voice guidance available in multiple languages, automatic re-routing, 2D and 3D maps, audio player (MP3, WMA and WAV), photo viewer and an A/V input port that allows users to use the screen as a in-car display to watch you DVDs or play your favorite games. Finally, the Maxtek MNT-7T comes with a DVD that contains US maps. For the price it looks like a really good deal, however I wasn’t able to find any reviews of the unit.

Although the product information are not live yet on Magellan’s site they issued a press release announcing them with suggested retail prices of $399.99, $499.99 and $699.99 respectively and an expected shipping date of April 1st for the 4000 and 4040 while the  Maestro 4050  should start shipping in North America sometime this May.

It features a 7″ TFT-LCD touchscreen (800*480 WVGA), a 500MHz processor by AMD (Alchemy Au1200), SiRF III GPS chipset and 128MB RAM (DDR2) 2GB SD card. The unit has also a Picture-in-Picture feature (they call it Navi-in-Picture) that allows users to watch TV while navigating. The fact that the device has a number of multimedia goodies is of course no surprise, V7 supports the playback of DivX, XviD, MPEG-4, and WMV video, as well as music files. Finally it has an FM transmitter and is powered by a 4200mAh battery and probably has a lot more features that I can not read or autotranslate because they decided to post all the information in the form of images and my Korean are a bit rusty.  V7 costs around 630$     Product Page                    Posted in  PMP GPS  by: Dimitris    No Comments                     05     Mar        TomTom Go 715                     Another new GPS System by TomTom has leaked through the FCC. This Time it’s the TomTom Go 715 after the  TomTom DUO  and the TomTom ONE XL. Like it’s predecessor the TomTom GO 710 it sports Bluetooth functionality for hands free calling but what appears to be a new feature is that it has a SIM card slot that will allow users to make calls and send text messages for the 715 itself. By looking at the  manual  it appears that the 715 is an upgrade mainly targeted at the business market with software that allows the user to receive and manage orders and to communicate with his office about the status of the orders. I guess we will have to wait until the CeBIT to see if these new model will be a replacement of the 710 or just an addition model targeting mostly the business part of the market.

It features a 4.3″ Touch Screen Display (TFT LCD), 300 MHz CPU, 64 MB Flash ROM and 64 MB SD RAM and a 20-Channel GPS Receiver. Of course like every new GPS System that respects itself, it offers more than just navigation. It sports an MP3 Player and  two games  Sudoku  and Blockbuster.    Other features include:     European Maps   Voice Guidance   Automatic Display Brightness Control   Stereo Headphone Out   SD Card Slot   IR Receiver for Remote Control   2D/3D Map view   Lithium-Ion Battery 2500 mAh for 4h navigation   Dimensions: 125 mm x 83 mm x 24 mm    Weight: 259 g   Freely customizable infobar     Finally the written menus are available in 21 written languages (20 if you consider English UK and US the same :)) and it can also guide you using 24 different voices 24 voices (English UK, English US (3x), Spanish (2x), French (2x), German (2x), Italian (3x), Brasil, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slowenian, Swedish, Turkish).   The PN 3000 comes in three versions the basic model, a model with with TMC, and a model with TMC and bluetooth.    The price is not listed on the site but it appears that the retail prices for the three models are 470, 500 and 550 Euros respectively.

First there was  a report  of an unknown TomTom unit appearing on FCC and later on a  post   by GPS Review it was mentioned that this brand new unit will be called  TomTom Duo . Not a lot of information is available yet but it appears that it will be coming with a docking station equipped with an FM transmitter that will provide navigational  directions, as well as music from external players such as the iPod through the car’s sound system, . Other features that have been mentioned include SD, hands free Bluetooth calling and voice SMS and a tweaked interface. More information and the official announcement are expected at the CeBIT.

The review has been added to my  ViaMichelin X-930 Reviews  where I have compiled a list of all the reviews available for this navigation system. By adding this review the overall average rating from all the reviews has slightly fallen to 62/100. PC Magazine gave the unit a “fair” and the reviewer’s main complaint was the difficult menu system.

clueweb09-en0000-02-25067	                    Low Cost ISP Providers - Cheap Internet Service, DSL, Dial Up, Cable Internet   Use this site to find low cost ISP providers. Compare cheap Internet service providers including high speed DSL, dial up ISP and cable internet services. We help you find a cheap ISP and decide which is best for you: DSL service, dial up access, cable or satellite ISP.   Dial Up ISP  –  DSL Service  –  Cable Internet  –  Satellite Internet  –  Wireless  –  VOIP     Low Cost Dial Up ISP Internet If you're looking for  cheap internet service , a dial up ISP is probably your best choice. This is because dial up access tends to be the cheaper than broadband services such as DSL or cable Internet. Plus, many dialup ISPs offer local connections nationwide. Compare ISPs like NetZero, Earthlink, Juno and PeoplePC Online. Dial Up ISP   Cheap DSL Service Providers Many people go with broadband services like DSL Internet because it is so much faster than dialup access. However, it is also generally more expensive, so browse our DSL provider listings to find discounts & deals. See promotions on digital subscriber line from Verizon, AT&T Yahoo, Qwest, BellSouth and Earth Link. DSL Service Providers   Discount Cable Internet Service Although there are many cable companies that offer cable Internet access, most locations only have one company available in the area. However, you can still save by getting the best deal from your cable provider with our discount cable ISP offers. Browse special offers from cable companies like Comcast, Cox, Road Runner, Charter and Adelphia. Cable Internet   Satellite Internet Service A high speed Internet alternative to cable and DSL is satellite Internet. Satellite is often not as fast and costs more than other broad band solutions, so it is usually the best option only when cable and DSL are not available. Compare Hughes and WildBlue specials. Satellite Internet Access   Wireless Internet Access Get high speed connections from thousands of wifi hot spots around the world (including airports, hotels, restaurants, book stores, coffee houses and cafes) using a wireless hot spot aggregator such as Boingo Wireless. Wireless Internet   VOIP Phone Services When you have a broadband connection, you can save with discount or free VOIP phone plans. Voice Over IP means your calls get routed over the Net, which is why they are so cheap. With free phone call companies like Skype, you make voice calls from your computer to other people at their computers. However, it is so convenient, natural and easy to use with the top VOIP phone companies like Vonage, Packet8, Verizon and ViaTalk, because they allow you to use your regular telephone. VOIP Providers   Free Internet Access There used to be many free internet service providers to choose from. Now free internet access is really limited, but it is still an available option for those that don't want to pay, or can't pay, for an ISP. Free Internet Access   Low Cost ISP Providers A low cost ISP doesn't mean poor service and the cheapest deal isn't necessarily the best value. Our listings include quality ISPs and information to help you assess which one is the best value for your needs. We also include links and information to help you get discount deals for top name ISPs.   Learn more about how to  choose an internet service provider  or  cancel an account . Read on  how to speed up a computer , a  brief history of the Internet ,  how to protect email from spam ,  how to protect your computer from spyware and adware ,  how to choose an ISP ,  tips for avoiding online scams  or  how to secure a wireless home network .     Most of the dial up services we list provide nationwide access, so there is a local dialup connection number in most local areas. For high speed access, cable and DSL providers often have more limited coverage area, but typically people will have one company of each type to choose from in their local area. Satellite is the other high speed option, and this may be the only choice for rural customers that cannot get internet access from the DSL or cable company.

We are talking about finding the perfect yet cheap ISP. The next question that quite automatically arises in your mind is, what is ISP?    What is ISP?     ISP stands for Internet Service Provider. An ISP is a company that provides Internet connectivity for home and business users. An ISP connection can be of more that one type, it can be the conventional modem dial-up to DSL or it can be cable modem broadband for T1 or T3 lines. These days there are Wireless Internet Service Providers or WISPs that offer wireless LAN or broadband connections to users. ISPs are now offering more than just the basic Internet connection, they are offering services like email, Web hosting and access to software tools.     Types of ISPs     To talk about the most common types of ISPs would be talking about Dial-up, Broadband, Cable and Satellite. Dial up is one of the most popular types of ISP and this is because it was one of the first. This type of connection is good when all you use it for is checking mail. The speed of Dial up ISP is pretty slow. Satellite is not the best ISP if what you want is high speed Internet. But it is the best bet when you are in a rural area and technology is not at its best. Broadband ISP these days is becoming the most popular type. This is because not only is it faster and more efficient, but also because it is more cost-effective. And all that is needed for broadband is network interface card or Ethernet connection. ADSL is a variation of Broadband for home users. It works on a landline connection but at a much faster speed. The price is competitive as compared to broadband and cheaper compared to dial up.     Choosing a cheap ISP     Most ISPs offer different deals depending on the type of usage. There are different deals for business, large and small, and then there are different deals for home users. And as with everything else, there is competition among ISPs. You need to choose well and choose a cheap ISP. Here are three tips for choosing a Cheap ISP: Cost of service: so the whole point of choosing a cheap ISP is that it should be cheap. Before you go choosing an ISP, you need to find out how much it is going to cost you and whether or not it is cost effective for you according to your usage. What most ISPs will do is that they advertise some price and then three months later they will increase it. Check for such conditions before choosing one ISP. Speed: this is one of the most important things while you are selecting an ISP (apart from cost), the speed of the Internet Service. Depending on what you are going to use the Internet service for, the speed should be according to that. Are you going to be watching movies online or downloading music, or are you ripping books, or just checking emails. For higher speeds, broadband and satellite connections are suitable; dial up is slower and perfect for checking emails. Speed also depends on your computer; older machines cannot support high-speed Internet. Offers: besides offering Internet service, ISPs also offer different services and features. Free web storage, web hosting, email accounts are some of the things ISPs offer. But there could be hidden costs involved so read the fine print carefully. Also look for their customer service; a good ISP should have a good support service. So while you are looking for cheap ISPs, do not overlook the speed and overall quality and service they offer.

clueweb09-en0000-02-25080	                    Low Cost ISP Providers - Cheap Internet Service, DSL, Dial Up, Cable Internet   Use this site to find low cost ISP providers. Compare cheap Internet service providers including high speed DSL, dial up ISP and cable internet services. We help you find a cheap ISP and decide which is best for you: DSL service, dial up access, cable or satellite ISP.   Dial Up ISP  –  DSL Service  –  Cable Internet  –  Satellite Internet  –  Wireless  –  VOIP     Low Cost Dial Up ISP Internet If you're looking for  cheap internet service , a dial up ISP is probably your best choice. This is because dial up access tends to be the cheaper than broadband services such as DSL or cable Internet. Plus, many dialup ISPs offer local connections nationwide. Compare ISPs like NetZero, Earthlink, Juno and PeoplePC Online. Dial Up ISP   Cheap DSL Service Providers Many people go with broadband services like DSL Internet because it is so much faster than dialup access. However, it is also generally more expensive, so browse our DSL provider listings to find discounts & deals. See promotions on digital subscriber line from Verizon, AT&T Yahoo, Qwest, BellSouth and Earth Link. DSL Service Providers   Discount Cable Internet Service Although there are many cable companies that offer cable Internet access, most locations only have one company available in the area. However, you can still save by getting the best deal from your cable provider with our discount cable ISP offers. Browse special offers from cable companies like Comcast, Cox, Road Runner, Charter and Adelphia. Cable Internet   Satellite Internet Service A high speed Internet alternative to cable and DSL is satellite Internet. Satellite is often not as fast and costs more than other broad band solutions, so it is usually the best option only when cable and DSL are not available. Compare Hughes and WildBlue specials. Satellite Internet Access   Wireless Internet Access Get high speed connections from thousands of wifi hot spots around the world (including airports, hotels, restaurants, book stores, coffee houses and cafes) using a wireless hot spot aggregator such as Boingo Wireless. Wireless Internet   VOIP Phone Services When you have a broadband connection, you can save with discount or free VOIP phone plans. Voice Over IP means your calls get routed over the Net, which is why they are so cheap. With free phone call companies like Skype, you make voice calls from your computer to other people at their computers. However, it is so convenient, natural and easy to use with the top VOIP phone companies like Vonage, Packet8, Verizon and ViaTalk, because they allow you to use your regular telephone. VOIP Providers   Free Internet Access There used to be many free internet service providers to choose from. Now free internet access is really limited, but it is still an available option for those that don't want to pay, or can't pay, for an ISP. Free Internet Access   Low Cost ISP Providers A low cost ISP doesn't mean poor service and the cheapest deal isn't necessarily the best value. Our listings include quality ISPs and information to help you assess which one is the best value for your needs. We also include links and information to help you get discount deals for top name ISPs.   Learn more about how to  choose an internet service provider  or  cancel an account .

Most of the dial up services we list provide nationwide access, so there is a local dialup connection number in most local areas. For high speed access, cable and DSL providers often have more limited coverage area, but typically people will have one company of each type to choose from in their local area. Satellite is the other high speed option, and this may be the only choice for rural customers that cannot get internet access from the DSL or cable company.

That is until I came across the Logitech G11 Gaming Keyboard.  This is a quality piece of work with illuminated characters on every key and 3 levels of backlighting.  I was very happy with the feel of the keyboard as well, a very positive experience with great feel and good layout.  The only feature I wasn’t too happy with was the volume control, it utilizes a dial instead of buttons.       While the backlighting is a great feature, it is not the main selling point of this keyboard.  There are 18 programmable keys on the left side of the board.  Using these buttons along with the three mode buttons above them (M1, M2, and M3) gives you 54 keys to assign keystrokes, shortcuts, functions or macros.  You can create different profiles so that the keyboard is programmed for whichever game or application you are using.  You can even record macros while your are playing a game!  While I have found this to be of wonderful use for gaming, it is even more handy for my needs at work.  I can set up profiles for web development, graphics, database administration, etc.  The included software makes assigning the desired functionality to these keys quite simple and straight forward.     Another bonus for game players is a simple slide switch that will turn off the functionality of the Windows key.  This proves quite useful in keeping you from accidentally kicking yourself to the desktop right in the middle of your game.  Along with this, you will also find two USB ports on the tip of the board.   I found the keyboard at  NewEgg  for $58.99 + shipping - definitely well worth it.
