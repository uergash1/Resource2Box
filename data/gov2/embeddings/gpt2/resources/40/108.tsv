By Wayne Spivak, ADSO-CS 1SR  United States Coast Guard Auxiliary    Ahoy, Hunter! Do you a hunt waterfowl or hunt in and around lakes, streams, rivers, or ponds? Do you use a jon boat, rowboat, duck-boat or a blind near your favorite haunt? If you do, you should seriously think about getting more education -- specifically boating education!   Most of us think accidents never happen to us, but denial won't help if you or someone in your party is involved in an accident. In the year 2000, the Coast Guard reported that 23 vessels were involved in accidents while the occupants were hunting. Ten (10) fatalities resulted from those 23 accidents. That's about 1/10th of 1% of all fatalities reported that year -- not much of a risk. But it's 43% of all boating accidents related to hunting. Now that's a major risk!   1999 wasn't too much different, with 36 accidents and 13 fatalities. That's an improvement in your chances of living, with the fatality percentage decreasing to 36%. But if you're the unfortunate member of the 36%, it isn't much comfort.    Why the need for more boater education? It's based somewhat on the above statistics, but those statistics are the improved numbers. There has been a steady improvement (decline in accidents and deaths) in both boating and hunting since both mandatory and suggested education programs were instituted.    So, currently your chances of being in an accident or dying from that accident are, at least by the statistical pattern, low. But remember, these are still only the  reported  statistics! How many of us report little, embarrassing accidents, even if they caused not-so-little injuries?    If we as participants in the sport of boating and hunting slack off on the non-mandatory education efforts, these statistics will begin to rise. It has taken years of effort by the  interested parties (US Coast Guard Auxiliary as well as state agencies and other teaching entities) to improve these statistics. And, the collective ""we"" are still not happy!   New Dimensions    Boating while involved in hunting adds new dimensions and new dangers, to both boating and hunting. Not only do you need to observe the rules inherent in boating (both from a legal standpoint AND a boating technique stance), but you also have the added element of danger: your weapon. Boats, especially jon boats (or duck-boats) and rowboats are not known for their high degree of lateral stability.   It's extremely easy to swamp or broach these boats by shifting the weight distribution within the boat. Multiple hunters in a small boat just add to the danger. Fields of fire need to be mapped out and exactingly maintained. Movement within the boat -- from the act of swinging shotguns and rifles to the bird dogs jumping into the water -- need to be understood and factored into the mix.    Changes in the weather (leading to exposure to the harsher elements and their subsequent negative effects) are also part of the dangers both boaters and hunters endure. Hypothermia is the major threat to both groups of sportsman, especially during the hunting seasons in fall and winter.   Hunting and boating as well as every other outdoor sport are best enjoyed when you return back home safe and sound. Education is part of any sport, but activities that have more risk require more risk management. Look into a boating safety course in your neck of the woods if you haven't already done so.

They recently completed a project with an elementary school in Philadelphia to create a littering awareness poster. The original idea was to educate boaters about containing trash. Based on their research, however, they concluded that a large majority of the trash in our waterways comes from towns and cities. As such, the students created a poster that asks people to protect marine life, waterways, and drinking water supplies by keeping trash off of streets and highways. This project was funded by a grant from the BoatU.S. Foundation. To order a copy of the poster, contact the Wooden Boat Factory at 215-755-2400 or info@woodenboatfactory.org .

Five other facilities were lauded as Clean Marina Partners: Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, Green Ridge State Forest, Herrington Manor State Park, Queenstown Harbor Community Pier, and Rocky Gap State Park. Clean Marina Partners are not true marinas yet they minimize their own pollution and promote clean boating practices. Following the ceremony, Zahnisers General Manager Jim Sharkey led a tour highlighting some of the many pollution control measures he maintains. For example, there is a stormwater infiltration system along the bulkhead, a settling basin to collect residue from pressure washing , and an oyster nursery. ]  St. Michaels Marina is the 34th marina in Maryland to earn the Clean Marina Award. The harbor is what draws people to St. Michaels, said Steve Kilmon, marina manager. We are happy to do our part to protect the beauty of this area. The marina has about 50 slips and caters to transient boaters visiting the picturesque village of St. Bob Wilson, Mears Point Michaels. The daily influx of new customers Marina, with his Award presents a special challenge. Each new guest as reported in June. must be introduced to the marinas pollution prevention practices. To meet this need, Kilmon incorporated environmental rules into the slip agreement. For example, guests are asked to recycle cans and glass, refrain from discarding fish scraps into the harbor, and to clean up after their dogs. Also, he asks all fuel customers to use an oil absorbent pad or a nospill jug to capture any accidental spills before they hit the water. Sweden Point Marina in Smallwood State Park is the second  St. Michaels Marina, Sweden Point Marina, and Green Ridge State Forest are Certified  DNR-operated marina to earn the Clean Marina designation. Sweden Point offers slip rentals along the Potomac River in Charles County. There is no commercial boatyard but boaters can work on their vessels on land provided some basic rules are followed: the work must be done without creating any unsightly conditions or safety hazards. As part of their Clean Marina certification efforts, Park staff prepared an oil spill response plan and repaired a malfunctioning marine sewage pumpout station. The newest Clean Marina Partner is also a DNR facility. Bonds Landing Boat Ramp is located along the Potomac River, within the 43,000 acre Green Ridge State Forest (Allegany County). It is accessible only by dirt roads. Boaters that find their way to this remote put-in will find portable toilets and a sign urging environmental responsibility. Forest staff have taken measures to minimize pollution from other aspects of their operations as well. For example, all timber contracts stipulate that loggers must leave vegetated buffers around streams to protect water quality. ]  Operators of the 23 newest certified clean marinas and partners, along with dignitaries and Clean Marina program staff.

A more detailed template is available from the Clean Marina office: 410-260-8770. ]  Imagine boaters planning their cruises to stay at certified Clean Marinas throughout the mid-Atlantic region. Before long , boaters will have the opportunity to do just that. Virginia launched a Clean Marina program in January 2001 (visit www.deq.state.va.us/vacleanmarina for details). The District of Columbia and the National Park Service will be unveiling a Green Marina program this month. And the states of Delaware and New Jersey are committed to developing Clean Marina programs as well. Each of these efforts follows (or will follow) the structure of the Maryland Clean Marina Initiative. Representatives from the mid-Atlantic states have been meeting periodically t o establish consistency among the respective Clean Marina programs in everything from recommended pollution prevention measures to award criteria. By joining forces, we can ensure that boaters visiting a Clean Marina anywhere in the region will encounter the same high standards as have been adopted by Marylands certified Clean Marinas. Also, we can combine resources for things like advertising and, thereby, reach a greater number of boaters. Whether they are cruising the Chesapeake or Delaware Bays, the Coastal Bays, the Jersey Shore or any of the multitude of rivers that embrace the region, boaters can seek out Clean Marinas knowing that they are clean, safe,and environmentallyresponsible facilities. ]  ANCHOR BAY EAST MARINA, DUNDALK BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB, BALTIMORE BAY RIDGE CIVIC ASSN., ANNAPOLIS BERT JABINS YACHT YARD, ANNAPOLIS CHESAPEAKE HARBOUR MARINA, ANNAPOLIS COLTONS POINT MARINA, COLTONS PT.

GX267-56-7627353	"Overloading and too little freeboard is an invitation to capsizing and the most common cause of waterfowler drownings.  W boate  All of the accidents were a result of the boat capsizing or swamping due to overloading, sudden shifts in weight, or weather conditions. All but one happened under cold, stormy conditions in the latter half of the season. 60% were in canoes or boats 12' and under. Hypothermia (loss of body heat due to immersion in cold water) was a contributing cause of most of these deaths. More waterfowl hunter drownings occur on small sloughs than big lakes, possibly because big water hunters use larger, more stable boats, and are more likely to carry PFDs. PFDs: PREVENT FOOLISH DROWNINGS What can we do then, to avoid some of the hazards that befall too many hunters each year? The first and most important tip is to wear a U.S. Coast Guard approved personal flotation device (PFD) while traveling to and from your blind. A PFD can make a difference between life or death for a hunter who falls into cold water. Camouflage models are available in both the Type III vest and full sleeve ""float coat"" varieties, and both should offer adequate flotation and considerable protection against hypothermia in case you make an ""unscheduled water landing.""  ate rfowlers seldom think of themselves as rs. A fter all, isn't a boat simply a means to cross the slough to the blind and set out decoys? Why bo ther with lifejacke ts and boat cushions that take up space that could be used for extra decoys, dogs, guns, and a million things that duck hunte rs d eem es sential? The reason is simple. Hunters drown ne edlessly eve ry year b e cau se t hey s p e n d m o re ti me g e t ting t h e pe rfect camouflage paint job on their boat, than mak ing ce r t a i n t hey h av e t h e n e c e s s a r y equipment and skills to su rvive in an emergency.  People on board boats used for duck hunting are legally required to wear, or have readily accessible, a Coast Guard approved wearable personal flotation device (PFD or life vest.) PFDs come in a variety of hunting styles including camouflage vests, coveralls, and the float coat shown.  EIGHT COMMON FACTORS In a review of ten separate accidents resulting in 14 waterfowl hunter deaths in Minnesota, eight factors common to hunting boat fatalities become apparent:  Waterfowlers are more likely to drown in a boating accident than be shot by a hunting companion. None of the victims were wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), and only one even had a flotation cushion in the boat. 2/3 were men between 18 and 23 years of age. Possibly because young men are more likely to take greater risks, and generally have less experience than older hunters.  By keeping knees bent in a seated position, enough air is trapped in shin of waders or hip boots to keep you afloat for hours, even if you forget to put on your PFD! In this position, boots will NOT turn a practiced individual upside down.  OVERLOADING: AN INVITATION TO TRAGEDY Boats used for hunting should be checked to see if they will float when filled with water. All modern outboard boats have a capacity plate that indicates the maximum outboard motor horsepower as well as the carrying capacity of the boat. This is a good way to determine whether or not your boat is large enough for the gear you wish to transport. Any attempt to overload will result in a dangerous loss of freeboard, and too little freeboard is an invitation to the first large wave to swamp your boat. Hunting boats are typically small craft (under 14'), and many have flat bottoms which are particularly unsuitable for rough water. Hunters should avoid crossing large open bodies of water and stay as close to shore as possible when traveling to and from hunting locations. Make sure you have enough fuel. Take into account that your motor will use more gasoline when hunting than on a summer fishing trip. Decoys, dogs, and shells weigh more than fishing rods and tackle boxes, and will demand more power (and gasoline) from your outboard.  THE GALES OF NOVEMBER Keep an eye on the weather. All but one of the waterfowling boat fatalities in a seven year period happened after October 21, and in windy or stormy weather. Four hunters were lost in one storm in 1984, and in the infamous Armistice Day Storm of 1940, hundreds of hunters were stranded and scores drowned when boats capsized or swamped in six foot waves whipped by 50 MPH winds. Don't let bluebird weather at the start of a hunting trip lull your judgment, and be sure to get an up-to-date weather forecast. With practice, you can float in hip boots or waders, even if you forget to put on your PFD! If you keep your legs bent in a seated position, enough air is trapped in the shin area of the boot to keep you afloat for hours. You can then propel yourself backwards to return to your boat. Waders do not turn the practiced wearer upside down, and even when filled with water, they will not pull you to the bottom and do offer protection from hypothermia. As mentioned before, hypothermia is a factor in most duck hunter fatalities. Since water conducts heat 25 times faster than air of the same temperature, it is important to keep as much of your body out of the water as possible. If you unexpectedly enter cold water (any water less then 70 is considered cold), immediately attempt to reenter the boat. This will minimize the effects of hypothermia, and greatly increase your chances for survival. Do not remove your clothing unless it's absolutely necessary, since even wet clothing holds body heat in like a diver's wet suit.  Buoyancy of duck decoys, combined with the flotation provided by air trapped in hip boots can save your life.   Duration of Immersion (hours)  water and slowly tread water or dog paddle. The operative word here is slowly. Excess movement such as swimming or thrashing about, accelerates heat loss and encourages hypothermia. Unconsciousness can occur in as little as 15 minutes in very cold water, and death follows unconsciousness. ALCOHOL: THE DEADLY COMPANION When hunting, alcoholic beverages should be avoided. Besides increasing the possibility of a firearms accident, even ""just a couple of swallows"" can seriously impair judgment, increase risk taking, and reduce visual awareness. Contrary to what many people believe, alcoholic beverages don't warm you up, but actually serve to speed up cooling and bring on hypothermia. TORSO REFLEX: YOUR LAST GASP If you know you are about to fall into cold water, cover your face with your hands and hold your breath. Anyone who has ever gotten into a cold shower, knows the effects of the ""Torso Reflex."" This is your automatic gasp for air in response to being hit in the chest area with cold water. If your mouth is under water when this gasp occurs, drowning is the most probable outcome.

VIDEOS The DNR has VHS videos available to Minnesota groups and organizations that are of special interest to waterfowlers. Judgement on the Water (#198), has an especially good sequence on duck hunting safety. Wader Safety (#194), explains how to handle emergencies while wearing hip boots and waders. It shows people jumping into the water wearing waders, and how to float and swim when wearing both types of boots. For information on borrowing these videos, call the DNR Video Loan Service at the phone numbers below.  H.E.L.P. YOURSELF If you fall in while wearing a PFD and decide not to swim for shore, and can't get back into your swamped boat, you can reduce the effects of hypothermia by assuming the heat escape lessening position (H.E.L.P.). Cross ankles, cross arms over chest, draw knees to chest, lean back and try to relax. This head out of the water, fetal position reduces body heat flow to the water by at least 50%. It should, however, be tried in a pool before depending on it. Note that the hands should be kept high on the shoulders or neck. If kept out of the water, the hands will stay warmer and more flexible -- an important factor in self rescue. If more than one person is in the water and wearing PFDs, the ""huddle"" is recommended. This is where small groups of two to four ""hug"" with chest closely touching chest. Your arms should be placed around the backs of the others and kept underwater, while smaller individuals or children can be placed in the middle of the ""sandwich."" The huddle helps to conserve body heat and it is also easier for rescuers to locate than one lone victim. The close proximity of victims can serve also as a significant morale booster. Studies have shown that 97% of all non-PFD wearing adult males can float motionlessly, hands stretched behind their heads, with faces out of the water for long periods. If large waves prevent floating on the back, a non-PFD wearing individual should keep his or her head out of the  Minnesota  DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES  Boat and Water Safety Minnesota Department of Natural Resources 500 Lafayette Road St. Paul, MN 55155 - 4046  For more information, call: (Metro Area) (651) 296-6157 (MN Toll Free) 1-888-646-6367 Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (Metro Area) (651) 296-5484 (MN Toll Free) 1-800-657-3929 www.dnr.state.mn.us/boating.html This information is available in an alternative format upon request.

GX265-58-13170227	4300 Cherry Creek Drive South, Denver, CO 80246-1530  Phone: 303-692-2160  Fax: 303-691-7704  Recreational Fatalities in Colorado, 1996-1998 July 2000 No. 35  Unintentional injuries constitute the fifth leading cause of death in Colorado, killing over 1,400 Coloradans each year between 1996 and 1998. The number of deaths from unintentional injuries increased from 1,161 in 1990 to 1,539 in 1998. Deaths due to injuries during recreational activities are of particular interest in Colorado. This Brief aims to describe recreational activities-related fatalities that occurred in Colorado from 1996 through 1998 using the same procedures as those in a previous report describing recreational fatalities from 1993 through 19951. Unlike fatalities from most other leading causes of death, identification of the circumstances of injury death is not always possible through use of underlying cause of death codes. Therefore, to identify recreation-related fatalities, injury descriptions provided on the death certificate of all deaths occurring in Colorado during 1996 through 1998 were examined. Recreation relatedness was determined by analysis of the complete death certificate for each suspected case. Motor vehicle fatalities (decedent was a driver, passenger, or pedestrian) were not included in this report. Although every effort was made to uncover all recreation-related deaths occurring in Colorado, this compilation may not be all inclusive. Due to the difficult nature of determining such fatalities, some recreational fatalities may have been missed. The recreational fatalities identified were grouped by categories that best described the deaths and allowed for meaningful analyses. Because no standard categories for recreational deaths exist, the categories in the previous Brief and this report were determined by the Health Statistics Section after analysis of various reports and consultation with individuals specializing in injury epidemiology. Information regarding certain recreational categories is contained in the text for each category. The data presented in this report are for those recreational fatalities that occurred during the calendar years 1996-1998 in the state of Colorado to both state residents and nonresidents. Because of the small sample size, the conclusions drawn in this report might differ from the conclusions made in the previous report, and the results should be interpreted with caution.  Overview For the three-year period of 1996-1998, 211 recreation-related deaths were identified. Among those deaths, 21 percent (44 deaths) occurred to non-Colorado residents. The annual average death ratio* was estimated as 1.8 deaths per 100,000 Colorado resident population, which is lower than the annual average ratio of 2.3 deaths per 100,000 Colorado resident population in the previous report. Among the nine recreational categories, the greatest number of fatalities was recorded in the category of climbing/hiking with 37 deaths. Snow skiing was the next most common category with 36 deaths, followed by bicycling with 30 (Figure 1). *  all occurrences divided by resident population  1 On the Web: http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/hs/  E-Mail: health.statistics@state.co.us   Overall, males accounted for 82 percent of all recreational deaths in Colorado in the three year period, and persons age 20-39 had the highest number of recreational deaths at 89 (Table 1). About  93 percent of all recreational deaths (196) occurred to white/nonHispanic people (data not shown). The leading types of recreational fatalities differed by age group (Tables 1 and 2).

Tied categories.  2   Swimming pool fatalities were the most common recreational fatalities for the age group 0-9 at 31 percent of deaths. Snow skiing fatalities were the leading type of death for those age 1019, while climbing/hiking fatalities were the leading type of death for the 20-39 age group, at 23 percent and 29 percent respectively. For the age group 60 and older, bicycling accounted for the greatest proportion of recreational deaths (25 percent). Climbing/Hiking Although the activities of climbing (i.e., technical rock climbing and/or mountaineering) and hiking can be very different, for the purposes of this study it was not possible to segregate the two types of recreational activity deaths. There were 37 climbing/ hiking deaths during 1996-1998 (Table 1). Of the 37 climbing/ hiking deaths, 32 (86 percent) were male and 26 (70 percent) were in the 20-39 age group (see Figure 2).  Snow Skiing This category includes both downhill/alpine and cross-country ski fatalities. There were 36 such deaths recorded in Colorado during the calendar years 1996-1998. Fatal ski injuries were most often caused by the skier hitting a tree or another object (61 percent), falling (14 percent), or being caught in an avalanche (11 percent) (See Figure 4). The majority (69 percent) of snow skiing fatalities were less than 40 years of age. Over 80 percent were male.  The months with the greatest number of climbing/hiking fatalities were July and October with six deaths each, and August with five deaths. All of the 37 climbers/hikers identified in the current analyses died from falling. Bicycling It was not possible to distinguish between pure recreation and transportation bicycling deaths; therefore, this category includes both types of bicycling injury fatalities. There were 30 bicycling fatalities over the three-year period (Table 1 and Figure 3). Over 83 percent (25 deaths) of the bicycling deaths were male. Bicycling was the leading type of recreational fatality for people age 60 or older.  Swimming--Nonpool Swimming deaths were segregated by pool and nonpool. No boatrelated deaths were categorized as swimming (pool or nonpool) deaths in this report. Nonpool fatalities include those in which the decedent was swimming or playing in a lake, reservoir, pond, river, stream, etc. In the three-year period, there were 18 nonpool swimming deaths, all of whom were male. Eight of these fatalities were in the 2039 age group. Fifteen of the 18 nonpool swimming deaths occurred during June, July, and August.  3   Swimming Pool This category includes all deaths that occurred in a swimming pool, including those that occurred at a place of residence. There were eight swimming pool fatalities during the three-year period. Four of the eight swimming pool deaths were to children 0-9 years of age; five were male. Six swimming pool fatalities occurred at a public place for recreation and sport and/or public building. Canoeing/Kayaking and Rafting For the purposes of this Brief, canoeing and kayaking deaths have been grouped together. There were seven canoeing/ kayaking-related deaths and 14 rafting deaths. Seventeen of those who died from canoeing/kayaking and/or rafting accidents were male. Eleven of the 21 fatalities (52 percent) were over 40 years of age. All 21 canoeing/kayaking and rafting fatalities were caused by accidental submersion and/or drowning.  Horseback Riding There were 13 horseback riding fatalities during 1996-1998, ten of which occurred in May through August. Boating/Water Skiing This category does not include those who were fishing from a boat. A separate category (presented below) includes all fishing-related deaths. There were 21 boating and/or water skiing deaths during 1996 through 1998. Of the boating/water skiing fatalities, 48 percent (10 deaths) were 20-39 years of age; 18 of the 21 deaths were male. Of the 21 deaths, 19 occurred in April through August. Only Jefferson County had more than two (four deaths) fatal boating/water skiing injury occurrences in 1996 through 1998. Fishing and Hunting Five fishing and five hunting deaths occurred over the threeyear period. Four of the hunting fatalities were 40-59 years of age and older; all of the fishing and hunting fatalities were male.  Table 3.

GX250-49-3090204	"""Good Mate"" Video for Boaters Available to Marinas! Promoting stewardship of America's waterways is the focus of this outstanding video, produced by The Ocean Conservancy. According to The Conservancy, there are more than 10,000 marinas in the United States serving more than 22 million pleasure and work boats. Small day-to-day changes in the ways boaters maintain and operate boats can make a big difference in protecting aquatic habitats. The video focuses on four sources of pollution associated with recreational boating , and teaches simple, inexpensive techniques that boaters can follow to prevent water pollution from fuel and oil, sewage, boat maintenance, and debris. Marina operators familiar with Annapolis will be treated to footage of some very familiar waters. A simple and easy way to reach customers is playing the video either in the ship's store or other common area during the spring commissioning season. This reinforces efforts to support clean marinas, and reminds boaters that everyone has a role in protecting the environment. The video sells for $9.95 plus shipping .

Continued on page 2  ""Good Mate"" Video Available  Page 4  1   Maryland's Two ""No Discharge Zones"" The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) would like to remind boaters and marninas that Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays are no discharge zones (NDZs) for boat sewage. These two NDZ designations (the first in Maryland) went into effect in 2002 and remain in effect. It is illegal for a vessel to discharge raw sewage anywhere within three miles of the coast. An NDZ is an area of water where it is also illegal to discharge sewage treated by a certified Type I or Type II marine sanitation device (MSD). When operating in an NDZ, Type I and Type II MSDs cannot be used and must be secured. Acceptable methods to secure these systems include locking the door to the head or disabling the seacock. Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays were selected because there was very strong local support for the NDZ designations in both areas. Additionally, both areas have living resources that are sensitive to the discharge of boat waste, both have a high concentration of vessels, and both have sufficient pumpout facilities to accommodate resident and transient boats. Steuart Chaney, president of Herrington Harbour Marinas, is also a member of the Lower Western Shore Tributary Strategies Team which was instrumental in the implementation of the Herring Bay NDZ. "" The boaters and maritime community of Herring Bay are taking the lead in helping the environment by their support of the NDZ in Herring Bay,"" he said. "" We believe that this initiative will focus regulatory attention on the other, more significant sources of pollution. Ultimately, the NDZ will lead to a cleaner environment for all of Herring Bay."" Dave Blazer is the executive director of the Maryland Coastal Bays Program. Dave points out that an NDZ recommendation was included in the 1999 Comprehensive Management and Conservation Plan for the Maryland Coastal Bays. ""Clean water is the very lifeblood of both Ocean City and Worcester County,"" he said. ""The no discharge zone designation for the northern Coastal Bays fits perfectly into our plans to address all sources of pollution in this area."" For further information about the Herring Bay and northern Coastal Bays NDZs, visit www.dnr.state.md.us/ boating/pumpout/ndz.html or call DNR at (410) 260-8770. Additionally, the Natural Resources Police (NRP) Reserve Officers are once again offering Courtesy Vessel Examinations at marinas throughout Maryland. The Courtesy Vessel Examination program is a great way to provide boaters with safety and environmental information (including marine sanitation) in a very positive and non-threatening manner.

Anne Arundel County Waste Management estimates there are about 40 tons of shrink-wrap used in winter boat storage in the county. In Cecil county, dumpsters will be placed at Kingfisher Environmental Service Inc., McDaniel Yacht Basin, and Duffy Creek Marina. In Anne Arundel County, the public works department will place dumpsters at Clark's Landing Marina in Shady Side, Herrington Harbour North in Tracy 's Landing , Pasadena Boatel, Port Annapolis Marina, and Rhode River Marina in Edgewater.

Washburn's Boatyard (Solomons), Sunset Marina (Ocean City), and Anchorage Community Marina (Annapolis) have all recently been certified as clean facilities. To become a certified Clean Marina or Clean Marina Partner, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management. Chris Washburn, owner of Washburn's Boatyard, maintains a clean facility by conducting most work, such as engine repair, carpentry, and fiberglass, indoors. Yard manager Don Reimers says, ""Work outside is done using ground covers and/ or dustless sanders. Anybody who wants to work on their own boat also has to adhere to the same strict yard rules as our own staff. We work hard to educate all our customers about the importance of keeping trash and debris out of the water."" Washburn's is unique as it is the first boatyard to seek the award independently Don Reimers (left) and Chris Washburn happily accept their Clean Marina award. (Photos of from the marina in which it is located. Sunset Marina and Anchorage Cmmty. Marina Although Sunset Marina does not currently have a service department, boat staff were not available at press time.) owners may use independent contractors to work on their boats at the marina. Marina manager Brian Tinkler says, ""By having all slip holders and contractors work within a set of `environmental rules' we have a lot fewer problems. Providing recycling for oil and antifreeze also makes it easier for contractors to work within these rules."" Brian also says, ""Fuel docks are another big challenge. We have spill kits in each fueling area and written emergency response plans that all employees are trained on. I feel we are very well prepared if anything should happen."" At Anchorage Community Marina, all slip holders receive ""clean boating tip sheets"" on a variety of topics, in mailings throughout the year and clean boating tips are posted at the club house. And while they do not store any fuel on site, they have prepared written emergency response plans and contracted with an emergency spill response company, in the event of a fuel spill from a boat in or near their marina. Neighbors on either side of the small facility have a copy of the emergency response plan and all slip holders have the number of the spill response company. ""We are glad to do our part to support this program and to protect the waters surrounding our community,"" said dock chairman John Boaz. ""We felt this was a very worthy program and came together to participate and improve what we do here."" ]  workshops continued from page 1  5. Enjoy Your Rewards. Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps. Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in program displays at boat shows and in the newsletter. 6. Maintaining Clean Marina Status. Certified Clean Marinas must annually confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards. At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will set up a meeting to reaffirm Clean Marina status. In addition to reviewing the certification process and assistance available, a highlight of this year's workshops was a detailed review of the many regulations and permits that apply to marina and boatyard activities. On hand was Bob Daniel from the Maryland Department of Environment (MDE) which is the agency that issues and enforces the permits and regulations in the state Mr. Daniel works in the Environmental Permits Service Center at MDE, a unit aimed specifically at helping business operators identify, apply for, and operate under necessary permits. The Environmental Permits Service Center can be reached by calling (410)537-3772 or 800-633-6101, extension 3772. In spite of the weather, which forced the change of the date of one workshop and the location of another, approximately 100 people attended the workshops, representing 65 marinas and boatyards. Three marina managers signed a Pledge directly following a workshop and many more received Guidebooks to learn more about the program. ]  56 C  ERTIFIED C LEAN  M  ARINAS  ,B  OATYARDS AND Y ACHT C LUBS SPRING COVE MARINA, SOLOMONS SPRING COVE MARINA, ROCK HALL ST.

Since the mandatory classes began, Michigan has seen a significant drop in hunting related injuries and deaths.    Hunter safety courses are geared to improve hunter ethics, teach safe, responsible hunting, promote landowner-hunter relationships, encourage knowledge of laws and regulations and learn more about wildlife and habitat resources.   Students should be 12 years of age and older. Younger kids are welcome as long as they are able to read, comprehend and participate in the skills course work.     The minimum 10-hour course includes lectures, demonstrations, videos and explores a wide range of hunting equipment (firearms, muzzleloaders, archery and cross bow) and their safe use. Each volunteer instructor sets the schedule of the course.  Students must participate in the entire course (minimum 10-hours) to earn their certificate.

Most states and provinces in North America require some type of Hunter Safety courses.    The Hunter Safety and Firearm Safety courses are NOT the equivalent of specific gun safety course  and do NOT meet the requirements for Concealed Weapons permits.

Enjoy! !  Annual Clean Marina Awards Ceremony Set for August 2003 Each summer the Clean Marina Initiative hosts an annual awards ceremony to recognize marinas certified in the preceding year. The ceremony is a time to spotlight the great pollution prevention practices under way throughout the industry and to thank these marina and boatyard operators for their efforts to protect Maryland's waterways. The day will consist of remarks from a DNR representative (Secretary C. Ronald Franks has been invited), a representative from the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, and elected officials. The press is invited along with State representatives from each Clean Marina's district. Clean Marinas from the past year are presented citations, enjoy lunch, and round out the day with a tour of the host facility. This year, at least 15 facilities will be recognized at the event being planned for the first week in August. The timing was chosen to coincide with ""National Marina Day,"" which is an effort of the Marina Operators Association of America (MOAA) to celebrate the rich history of the marina industry as well as its bright future. National Marina Day focuses on the role of marinas as family-friendly gateways to boating and as stewards of the environment. To learn more about this event, slated nationally for August 9th, visit www.moaa.com. The goal of the Clean Marina Initiative is to certify twenty five percent of Maryland's approximately 600 boating facilities as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004. While not an unrealistic goal, presently just 11% have been certified (58 Clean Marinas and 12 Clean Marina Partners). Marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs are strongly encouraged to participate in this voluntary program aimed at preventing future regulation of this industry. For more information on the steps to certification, to obtain a Clean Marina Guidebook and Award Checklist, or to schedule an informal walk through to assess a facility, call 410-260-8770.

I  NSIDE  T  HIS ISSUE  ... 2 2 3 1  Clean Marina Initiative Progress Report Marketing Tips for Marinas Two New Clean Marinas!   B  Clean Marina Program Progress Report  TWO NEW CERTIFIED CLEAN MARINAS Knapps Narrows Marina (Tilghman Island) and Oak Harbor Marina (Pasadena) both recently became certified Clean Marinas. To become a certified Clean Marina, managers must implement measures to control pollution associated with vessel maintenance and repair; petroleum storage and transfer; sewage disposal; solid, liquid and hazardous wastes; stormwater runoff; and facilities management. Best management practices for all these topics are offered in the Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook. Mark Julyan, General Manager of Knapps Narrows Marina, maintains a clean marina by insisting on vacuum sanding in the yard and using ground tarps when heavy work is being conducted. Mark also enforces strict rules on the fuel dock and gives each customer a small oil-sorb cloth to capture any drips or spills. Additionally, he has strengthened his contracts with all slip holders, land storage customers, and subcontractors to include the statement that the marina follows Clean Marina practices and expects all customers to do the same. Knapps Narrows Marina also took advantage of Clean Marina grant funding in 2001 to purchase a wash water recycling system, vacuum sanders, a high-volume lowpressure spray gun, and to install a vegetated riparian buffer to filter stormwater. As reported in the last issue Ken and Barbara Broman, owners of Oak Harbor Marina, and their sons have made many of Under way, Sunset Marina (Ocean City) was certified this improvements to Oak Harbor Marina to earn their Award. They purchased the marina and boatyard spring. Doris Kirkner accepts approximately one year ago, after having worked there for many years. The facility had suffered from the Award. neglect and had collected many derelict boats, mysterious drums and lots of trash and debris. The Bromans cut up and removed many abandoned boats, had old containers and drums professionally removed, and have put new yard rules into place to keep things moving in the right direction. They have filled up several roll-off dumpsters with trash and debris from the yard, cleaning up from years of bad habits of previous land storage customers. The Bromans have also improved employee training and emergency preparedness to become a Clean Marina. Both new Clean Marinas have much to be proud of! !  Marina Partners. There is clearly a long way to go, and ecause an aim of the Clean Marina Initiative is to prevent considerably more participation is needed.

This is a multi-year investment that requires upkeep, but over time can turn a drab facility into a showcase. 3. Make facilities inviting to visitors. Signs directing visitors to docks or the marina office are welcoming to first-time visitors trying to locate a friend or family member 's boat. Remember that the appearance of the facility is a calling card to present and future customers. !  Few marina operators have time during the boating season to visit neighboring facilities and see what ""the other guys"" are doing . The Clean Marina staff, however, is continually visiting a variety of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs and has compiled a short list of marketing tips that can make a marina shine. 1. Make a good first impression. What does the entry to the marina look like from the water and the road? Does the facility project a professional image? Docks should be neat and clean, and old dock boards should be replaced regularly. Landside entrances should not contain dumpsters, spare parts, and the like. 2. Invest in landscaping whenever possible. Welltended flowerbeds, ornamental grasses, and buffers around parking areas serve three purposes.

Isabel's Impacts on Pumpouts Many marinas around the region either lost or experienced damage to their pumpout systems. To date, over 80 marinas have notified the Department that their pumpouts were affected by the storm. Some of these pumpouts are now operational, at least temporarily, and others are in the process of being replaced. The pumpout program's goal is to see as many units as possible back on line by the 2004 boating season. Repairing a pumpout, if possible, is preferable to complete replacement. Because many units were submerged in salt water for an extended period of time, there is an understandable concern about how long ""repaired"" pumpout units will continue to operate. At the same time, however, several marinas have taken advantage of pumpout operations and maintenance (O&M) funding to make their pumpouts operational in time for winter haul-outs. For pumpout units beyond repair, program staff request that marinas explore all insurance options before seeking a grant to replace the unit. For pumpouts that are both destroyed and uninsured, marinas may apply for a grant to replace it. For further information about pumpout O&M and pumpout replacement grants, contact Don O'Neill or Kristen Fleming at (410) 260-8770. Don may be reached at doneill@dnr.state.md.us and Kristen may be reached at kfleming@dnr.state.md.us. Grant information and applications are available on line at www.dnr.state.md.us/boating .

Marina program will again hold a series of introductory workshops for marina operators. They will be held in key locations around the State, but the content of each workshop will be the same. Each workshop will provide: 3.  An introduction to the structure and goals of the program,  An explanation of the steps to become a certified clean marina,  A Clean Marina Guidebook, Pledge, and Award Checklist for interested participants (no cost),  Solutions to common stumbling blocks to certification (i.e., templates for commonly needed plans at marinas and boatyards, marina Participants at the 2003 workshop in Annapolis management and staff and steps to certification as a Clean Marina. training tools); and  Free lunch! The clean marina program and workshops are designed for managers of all sizes and types of marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubs. Participants will walk away with many useful tools 4. for improving management of their facilities and a better understanding of the incentives to becoming certified. An owner or operator of a certified Clean Marina will speak about his or her experience in the program and how it has affected his or her business. This first-hand account should help explain the certification process for those who are unfamiliar. Advanced registration will be necessary and announcements and registration forms will be mailed directly to all marinas on the division's current mailing list. There will 5. be no charge to attend the workshops. While the workshops are an effective, concise way to learn about the goals and structure of the Clean Marina Initiative, marinas are welcome to join the program at any time. To review, the steps to certification are: 1. Sign the Clean Marina Pledge: By signing the Clean Marina Pledge marina and boatyard managers commit to do their part to ""keep Maryland's waterways free of harmful chemicals, excess nutrients and debris."" It is also a pledge to seek certification within one year of 6. signing , although there is no penalty if that goal is not met. At this step a press release is issued to local papers and the marina's name appears on the Clean Marina web site. Conduct a Self-Assessment: Using the Clean Marina Guidebook and Checklist, marina and boatyard operators run through the questions, and see how close they already are to certification and where they need improvement. Call Upon a Mentor : Invariably, questions of interpretation and applicability of the questions on the Checklist arise. A call to the office of either the Clean Marina program (410260-8770) or the Marine Trades Association (410-2690741) can easily answer many questions or, if needed, find a source to assist with technical questions. Additionally, the Clean Marina program staff can set up an informal walk through of a marina to help determine what they may need to become certified. Many templates are included learn about the benefits in the Guidebook (to assist with stormwater plans, emergency plans, and employee training) and confidential compliance assistance is also available to assist in permitting issues. Schedule a Confirmation Visit: After the ""mentoring"" stage, marina managers and program staff can be confident the facility is meeting the minimum scores in all areas of the Checklist. A confirmation visit, conducted by a Clean Marina program staff member and a manager of a certified clean marina, is completed to verify the items on the Checklist. Any deficiencies found do not result in a penalty, but rather with assistance to rectify them. Enjoy the Rewards: Certified Clean Marinas receive an award certificate (signed by the Governor, Lt. Governor and Secretary of DNR), a large flag and small burgee to fly at the facility, permission to use the Clean Marina logo in their advertising and on their letterhead, and Clean Marina caps. Another press release is issued--statewide--announcing the certification, the marina receives its own online business card on the Clean Marina web site, and is prominently promoted in displays at boat shows and in the newsletter. Maintain the Clean Marina Status: Annually, marinas confirm in writing that they continue to meet the award standards described on the Clean Marina Award Checklist. At least every third year, a Clean Marina representative will revisit the facility to ensure it still meets award standards. !  Seven New Certified Clean Marinas! During the last few months seven marinas have completed their certification as Clean Marinas. This is a remarkable pace and will help the Clean Marina Initiative meet its goal of certifying 25 percent of the marinas in Maryland as Clean Marinas by the end of 2004. By doing so, the Department hopes to prevent further regulation of the industry. In September, Saefern Saddle and Yacht Club (Annapolis), Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort (Georgetown), and Worton Creek Marina (Chestertown) all became Clean Marinas. In November three more marinas and another yacht club joined the ranks: Chesapeake Yachting Center (Essex), Taylor 's Marina (Elkton), Hartge's Yacht Yard (Galesville), and Corinthian Yacht Club (Ridge). Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort and Worton Creek Marina both became certified as part of a recent round of Clean Marina cost- share grants (see page 2). While the grants helped fund wash water treatment systems at both marinas (one physical and one mechanical), both Rich Lauser (Skipjack Cove) and John & Libby Patnovic (Worton Creek) also improved their emergency planning and expanded their list of environmental rules for customers and staff. They also thoroughly reviewed necessary permits and plans, with help from the Clean Marina staff, and ensured all were up to date.

Most of what their Dockmaster, Robert Muir, did to earn the award was sharing emergency information and clean boating practices with the slip holders. He used not only printed material but the neighborhood's secure web site to make the information readily available and easy to update. The community has fully embraced the notion and are proud to be among the Clean Marinas in Maryland. Chesapeake Yachting Center is a full service facility with about 200 wet slips, 200 dry slips, a fuel dock and a whole host of services. To become certified, owner Frank Lampron and manager Russ Kirkhoff reviewed their required plans and permits, ensured they were all current, and improved their spill response kit and fueling procedures. They also improved written emergency response plans and stormwater management plans. Their attention to detail with the many plans and permits required for marinas that store fuel and haul boats, was especially important to their success. Taylor 's Marina, by contrast, is a small and simple Robert Muir, Saefern Saddle & Yacht marina owned by Mary and Dick Guttendorf, who Club, with the community's award. also operate nearby Locust Point Marina (also a Clean Marina). Taylor 's Marina simply offers slips, with water and electricity, and access to all the repair services at Locust Point. There is also a pool and a small-engine repair shop on site. The Guttendorf 's smartly carried over all their emergency plans and ""environmental rules"" for customers and contractors to Taylor 's customers. The marinas also share the use of a portable pump-out which has proven convenient for both sets of customers. Corinthian Yacht Club is only the second independent yacht club to become a certified Clean Marina. (The John and Libby Patnovic, owners of first was Baltimore Yacht Club.) This Worton Creek Marina, with their award. helps to dispel the notion that the Clean Marina program is only for marinas and boatyards; more yacht clubs are encouraged to participate. The yacht club is also a relatively simple operation-- no fuel or boatyard. However, they have a club house, several piers (both covered and uncovered), a pool, and several cottages that members can rent for short term use. To earn the award members Ron Riland and Earl Waesche, with club support, created a set of environmental rules and practices for both members and contractors, and promoted the recycling of used oil, antifreeze, batteries and other waste by posting directions to the nearest collection facility in a prominent location. Hartge Yacht Yard is a well-respected facility that has served boaters around the West River area for generations. This facility has about 200 slips, a fuel dock, and a multitude of boating services (i.e., rigging , fiberglass, woodshop) on site. Manager Alex Schlegel made some improvements to his stormwater management controls, and repaired damage previously done by stormwater, as part of his certification. He and his staff also included Clean Boating Tip Sheets (from the Clean Marina Guidebook) in mailings to all customers, to enlist their help in keeping the yard clean. They routinely use filter cloth and dustless sanders on all boats having major work done. They also recycle used oil, batteries, and aluminum cans. All these facilities serve as notable examples of the conservation ethic: individual responsibility for healthy land and water. The Clean Marina program thanks all those involved in these certifications and encourages other facilities to call the office to learn more. Informal visits are the best way to start on the As reported in the Autumn issue of Under way, The path to certification and streamline the process.

GX253-42-8683509	The Clean Marina Initiative is working with the engineering firm of Purdum and Jeschke to help marinas come into compliance with a federal regulation that requires certain facilities to have engineer-certified oil spill prevention, control and countermeasure (SPCC) plans. Any marina, boatyard or yacht club that stores greater than 660 gallons of oil in a single above ground tank, an aggregate of 1,320 gallons above ground, or greater than 42,000 gallons underground is required to have an SPCC plan. The term oil refers to all petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, solvents, and waste oil. The Clean Marina Initiative has developed a template and hired an engineering firm to certify plans at no cost to marinas. The template is available on the Clean Marina web site (www.dnr.state.md.us/boating) or by calling 410-260-8770. Submit the completed template to the Clean Marina office along with a current Clean Marina Pledge and a completed Clean Marina Award Checklist. DNR staff will then authorize contact with Purdum and Jeschke for plan review and certification. Priority for this service will be given to facilities that meet the Clean Marina criteria in all aspects except the SPCC requirement.

Governor Sarah Taylor-Rogers, Secretary Elizabeth Fuller Valentine, Editor Donna Morrow, Layout Barbara MacLeod, Copy Editor  UNDERW JUNE 2001 4 The Clean Marina Initiative has formed an alliance with a new, online marina reservation and slip management service. The partnership between the Clean Marina Initiative and Marinalife.com represents another opportunity for certified Clean Marinas to reach potential customers. Marinalife has developed Internet-based slip management software for marina operators. The Slip Manager Software allows managers to automate their entire reservation process including managing slip inventory, customers and leases. The software offers numerous features such as real time slip updates, invoicing capabilities, and customized reports. Marinalife also hosts a marina locator service through which boaters can search for facilities in particular areas with particular features. For instance, a boater can search for a marina in Annapolis with a fuel dock and laundry facilities by completing a simple form online. A list of marinas fitting the search criteria appears within seconds after hitting the send button. Boaters can then make reservations via the Internet at any Marinalife member marina. The Maryland Clean Marina logo, with a link to additional information about the program, will be clearly displayed next to every certified Clean Marina that is a Marinalife member. In addition, Clean Marina certification will soon be one of the criteria boaters can select when using the marina reservation and locator service. This feature will allow boaters to consciously seek out and patronize facilities that have met the Clean Marina Initiatives high standards. For more information about Marinalife, visit www.marinalife.com or call (410) 752-0505. ]  Maryland Clean Marinas  AY  Clean Marina Forms Partnership with Marinalife.com Boating Infrastructure Grant Program The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will inaugurate the new Boating Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program with the first round of awards this summer. The BIG program will provide $32 million to states and territories to construct, renovate or maintain tie-up facilities for recreational boats 26 feet or more in length. For Maryland, this means that a minimum of $400,000 will be available for projects such as mooring buoys, day-docks, navigational aids, transient slips, safe harbors, floating docks and fixed piers, floating and fixed breakwaters, dinghy docks, restrooms, retaining walls, bulkheads, dockside utilities, pumpout stations, recycling and trash receptacles, dockside pay telephones, debris deflection booms, and marine fueling stations. DNRs Waterway Improvement Program solicited proposals from state, county and municipal contacts for the first round of grant funding . They received requests for $1.5 million. DNR staff then selected a handful of the proposed projects to submit to USFWS for the $200,000 of funding that is available to Maryland this year. While private facilities were not asked to apply for this first round of funding , they may be invited to submit proposals in the future. Decisions on future projects to fund with both BIG monies and Waterway Improvement Funds* will take into consideration the results of a survey of boating infrastructure needs that will be conducted by the University of Baltimore this summer. University researchers will actually survey four groups:  Owners of vessels 26 feet or more in length (generally non-trailerable boats),  Owners of vessels less than 26 feet in length (generally trailerable boats),  Operators of facilities catering to boats 26 feet or more in length, and  Operators of facilities catering to boats under 26 feet in length. They will investigate boaters current use patterns, compile information about existing tie-up facilities and their conditions, identify boater access needs and preferences, assess factors that inhibit boating in specific areas, and list congested areas. The survey results will serve as the basis for a statewide plan. To learn more about the BIG program, contact Beth Fuller Valentine at (410) 260-8776. ] * The Waterway Improvement Fund is supported by boat excise taxes and a small percentage of the state motor fuel tax. The fund provides money to local, state and federal government agencies for a wide variety of capital projects to serve the boating public.

Over the past three months, six facilities have been certified as Clean Marinas and two others as Clean Marina Partners. Congratulations to the owners and staff of Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina, Chesapeake Harbour Marina, Mears Marina and Hartge Yacht Services, Mears Point Marina, Spring Cove Marina (Rock Hall), Tidewater Marina, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, and Rocky Gap State Park. Bay Ridge Civic Association Marina is the first noncommercial, community marina to meet the Clean Marina criteria. It has 116 slips and 8 moorings. As part of his efforts to achieve Clean Marina certification, Bay Ridge resident and Dockmaster Ken Karsten included clean boating information in the community s monthly newsletter. Instead of educating just the slip holders, we went the extra mile and trained over 400 households in the practices necessary to meet the Maryland Clean Marina guidelines, Karsten said. At Chesapeake Harbour Marina in Annapolis, General Manager George Colligan asks his customers not to discharge their sewage treatment systems within the marina basin. Sewage discharge treated by on-board systems still contains nutrients and possibly toxic chemicals and pathogens. Within a confined area like a marina these elements can degrade water quality.  There is an obvious connection between clean water and recreational boating , said Colligan. We need to do our part to protect the Chesapeake Bay. Mears Marina in Annapolis has over 230 slips and a boatyard that is managed independently of the marina. Marina Manager Desiree Bell and Louis Hartge of Hartge Yacht Services worked together to meet the Clean Marina award criteria. Under the guidance of Assistant Marina Manager Nancy Bray, both the marina and the boatyard have refined their pollution prevention measures. For example, Ms. Bray developed new environmental policies for all marina customers and Mr. Hartge uses filter fabric to prevent particles dislodged by pressure washing from running into the creek. Mears Point Marina in Grasonville is a full service marina complete with maintenance facilities, health club, and restaurant. The managers of Mears Po int Marina have developed comprehensive environmental management regulations. These rules are incorporated into all contracts: slips rentals, transient dockage, dry land storage, and outside contractors. One rule is that all boat owners who live aboard their vessels are required to have a contract with a company that provides dockside sewage pumpouts.  We emphasize to our customers that clean water is their responsibility, as well as ours, noted Dockmaster Jay Jones. By participating in the Clean Marina Initiative we are doing what we can to minimize the impacts of recreational boating on the health of the Bay. Although she does not sell fuel, Madelyn Reni, owner of Spring Cove Marina in Rock Hall, is prepared for a petroleum spill. In the event of an accidental spill, say from an onboard fuel leak that is pumped overboard by an automatic bilge pump, she has response equipment on site. She keeps oil absorbent pads and booms in a readily accessible container that can easily be taken out to the docks if necessary.

They are pleased to be part of the effort to protect the Chesapeake Bay. Tidewater Marina in Havre de Grace is a full service boating facility. In addition to wet and dry storage, boat sales, a store and a fuel dock, Tidewater offers a comprehensive line of services including haul-out, bottom painting , blister repair, rigging , engine repair, fiberglass, air conditioning and refrigeration, finish carpentry, electrical, plumbing , and electronics. With all of this activity going on, Manager Jeff Andrews has to insure that pollutants are not accidentally washed or blown into the water. As part of his efforts, Andrews requires that all workers use vacuum sanders, tarps, or tents to contain dust from sanding . Sand blasting must be conducted in an on-site containment stall. Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels is the first museum to be named a Maryland Clean Marina Partner. The Clean Marina Partner designation indicates that the museum managers minimize pollution from their own operations and actively promote clean boating habits. For example, at the counter where transient boaters register for slips there is a display  featuring clean boating tips. Dockmaster Robin Newberg is also prepared for an emergency. She has compiled two binders of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). One binder is kept in the boat shop and the other is in the museum admissions building . Additionally, Ms. Newberg has put together a third binder with just the health sections of MSDS sheets so that the most relevant information is readily available in case of overexposure to any chemical kept on-site. Rocky Gap State Park in Flintstone operates two boat ramps on a lake. The only two gasoline engines allowed on the lake are both on DNR vessels: one a rescue boat and the other a pontoon tour boat. The pontoon boat is equipped with a low-emission four-stroke engine. Compared to twostroke engines that may discharge a quarter of their fuel unburnt, four-stroke engines operate much more efficiently; generate substantially less smoke, fumes, and noise; and have easier starting , faster acceleration, and quicker throttle response. All of these facilities are truly making a difference and helping to protect the health of Marylands waterways.

Since the mandatory classes began, Michigan has seen a significant drop in hunting related injuries and deaths.    Hunter safety courses are geared to improve hunter ethics, teach safe, responsible hunting, promote landowner-hunter relationships, encourage knowledge of laws and regulations and learn more about wildlife and habitat resources.   Students should be 12 years of age and older. Younger kids are welcome as long as they are able to read, comprehend and participate in the skills course work.     The minimum 10-hour course includes lectures, demonstrations, videos and explores a wide range of hunting equipment (firearms, muzzleloaders, archery and cross bow) and their safe use. Each volunteer instructor sets the schedule of the course.  Students must participate in the entire course (minimum 10-hours) to earn their certificate.   Click here for a list of Hunter Safety Class Scheduled this year.   If you have lost your certificate,  Click here .   Most states and provinces in North America require some type of Hunter Safety courses.    The Hunter Safety and Firearm Safety courses are NOT the equivalent of specific gun safety course  and do NOT meet the requirements for Concealed Weapons permits. Please contact your local Sheriffs Department for information on Concealed Weapons Permits.   Visit the State Police Web site for more about carrying a concealed weapon.

Within the home, most cases involve people on the telephone, near    windows and doors, and in contact with plumbing and electrical equipment. Not    many people are killed indoors; half of these are in house fires. The ratio    of injuries to deaths is 20:1.     Of particular interest is the ""On cordless phone"" activity in Table 29 on    29 June 1994 in Massachusetts.  Storm Data  describes the incident as occurring    when ""A person talking on a cordless telephone in the living room of her house    was slightly injured by a lightning strike.""    TABLE 29.

Boating  « Surviving a  Cold-water Accident  «  Swamping/Capsizing  «  Weather or Not to Boat                 Water Fowl Hunters: Guess what! You should know more about boating!  By Wayne Spivak, ADSO-CS 1SR  United States Coast Guard Auxiliary    Ahoy, Hunter! Do you a hunt waterfowl or hunt in and around lakes, streams, rivers, or ponds? Do you use a jon boat, rowboat, duck-boat or a blind near your favorite haunt? If you do, you should seriously think about getting more education -- specifically boating education!   Most of us think accidents never happen to us, but denial won't help if you or someone in your party is involved in an accident. In the year 2000, the Coast Guard reported that 23 vessels were involved in accidents while the occupants were hunting. Ten (10) fatalities resulted from those 23 accidents. That's about 1/10th of 1% of all fatalities reported that year -- not much of a risk. But it's 43% of all boating accidents related to hunting. Now that's a major risk!   1999 wasn't too much different, with 36 accidents and 13 fatalities. That's an improvement in your chances of living, with the fatality percentage decreasing to 36%. But if you're the unfortunate member of the 36%, it isn't much comfort.    Why the need for more boater education? It's based somewhat on the above statistics, but those statistics are the improved numbers. There has been a steady improvement (decline in accidents and deaths) in both boating and hunting since both mandatory and suggested education programs were instituted.    So, currently your chances of being in an accident or dying from that accident are, at least by the statistical pattern, low. But remember, these are still only the  reported  statistics! How many of us report little, embarrassing accidents, even if they caused not-so-little injuries?    If we as participants in the sport of boating and hunting slack off on the non-mandatory education efforts, these statistics will begin to rise. It has taken years of effort by the  interested parties (US Coast Guard Auxiliary as well as state agencies and other teaching entities) to improve these statistics. And, the collective ""we"" are still not happy!   New Dimensions    Boating while involved in hunting adds new dimensions and new dangers, to both boating and hunting. Not only do you need to observe the rules inherent in boating (both from a legal standpoint AND a boating technique stance), but you also have the added element of danger: your weapon. Boats, especially jon boats (or duck-boats) and rowboats are not known for their high degree of lateral stability.   It's extremely easy to swamp or broach these boats by shifting the weight distribution within the boat. Multiple hunters in a small boat just add to the danger. Fields of fire need to be mapped out and exactingly maintained. Movement within the boat -- from the act of swinging shotguns and rifles to the bird dogs jumping into the water -- need to be understood and factored into the mix.    Changes in the weather (leading to exposure to the harsher elements and their subsequent negative effects) are also part of the dangers both boaters and hunters endure. Hypothermia is the major threat to both groups of sportsman, especially during the hunting seasons in fall and winter.   Hunting and boating as well as every other outdoor sport are best enjoyed when you return back home safe and sound. Education is part of any sport, but activities that have more risk require more risk management. Look into a boating safety course in your neck of the woods if you haven't already done so.

Since the mandatory classes began, Michigan has seen a significant drop in hunting related injuries and deaths.    Hunter safety courses are geared to improve hunter ethics, teach safe, responsible hunting, promote landowner-hunter relationships, encourage knowledge of laws and regulations and learn more about wildlife and habitat resources.   Students should be 12 years of age and older. Younger kids are welcome as long as they are able to read, comprehend and participate in the skills course work.     The minimum 10-hour course includes lectures, demonstrations, videos and explores a wide range of hunting equipment (firearms, muzzleloaders, archery and cross bow) and their safe use. Each volunteer instructor sets the schedule of the course.  Students must participate in the entire course (minimum 10-hours) to earn their certificate.

Most states and provinces in North America require some type of Hunter Safety courses.    The Hunter Safety and Firearm Safety courses are NOT the equivalent of specific gun safety course  and do NOT meet the requirements for Concealed Weapons permits. Please contact your local Sheriffs Department for information on Concealed Weapons Permits.   Visit the State Police Web site for more about carrying a concealed weapon.

Since the mandatory classes began, Michigan has seen a significant drop in hunting related injuries and deaths.    Hunter safety courses are geared to improve hunter ethics, teach safe, responsible hunting, promote landowner-hunter relationships, encourage knowledge of laws and regulations and learn more about wildlife and habitat resources.   Students should be 12 years of age and older. Younger kids are welcome as long as they are able to read, comprehend and participate in the skills course work.     The minimum 10-hour course includes lectures, demonstrations, videos and explores a wide range of hunting equipment (firearms, muzzleloaders, archery and cross bow) and their safe use. Each volunteer instructor sets the schedule of the course.  Students must participate in the entire course (minimum 10-hours) to earn their certificate.

Most states and provinces in North America require some type of Hunter Safety courses.    The Hunter Safety and Firearm Safety courses are NOT the equivalent of specific gun safety course  and do NOT meet the requirements for Concealed Weapons permits. Please contact your local Sheriffs Department for information on Concealed Weapons Permits.

Many farms in Virginia, depending on    their operations, benefit from nutrient management. Following the training,    participants can be certified by the state via exam to write nutrient management    plans.   The four-day schools, conducted by the Virginia Department of Conservation    and Recreation (DCR), are recommended for anyone involved in agriculture or    related industries, as well as natural resource professionals. Topics include    manure use on poultry and dairy operations, land application of biosolids, establishing    realistic crop yield goals and spreader calibration.   In Abingdon, the training session is Dec. 17 - 20 at Southwest Virginia Higher    Education Center. In Ashland, the session is Dec. 10 - 13 at Comfort Inn on    N. Cottage Ln.    The first two days of the school are lectures by Virginia Tech professors covering    soil science, soil fertility, crop production and managing organic nitrogen    sources. The last two days, DCR staff explains to participants the various components    of a nutrient management plan, while using a case study to write a plan in class.   Classes are 9 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. each day. There are no pre-requisites    for the training, however space is limited and participants must pre-register    before Nov. 18, 2002.    DCR's nutrient management training and certification teaches people to write    detailed plans. Recommendations in these plans show farmers how to efficiently    apply fertilizers and manures to get the most benefit for their crops. While    some people know nutrient management involves following planned recommendations,    just how a nutrient management plan works for an individual situation, or finding    someone to write a plan, can be confusing.   Nutrient management identifies how plant nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus    and potassium, are managed annually for     expected crop production. Nutrient management plans are written, site-specific    guidelines that address these issues. They achieve minimal adverse environmental    effects, primarily upon water quality, and avoid unnecessary nutrient applications.   To register for the training schools contact Susan Townsend at (804) 443-6752.    The fee is $75 for four days' training, supporting materials and refreshments.     On Feb. 7, 2003, DCR administers the Nutrient Management Certification Exam    in Abingdon and Sandston, Va. Call Susan Townsend for exam applications. Applications    with the $100 application fee must be submitted by 5 p.m., Jan. 7, 2003.   For information about DCR's Nutrient Management Certification and Training    Program contact David Kindig at (804) 371-8095. Training session and exam information    is on DCR's web site at www.state.va.us/dcr/sw/nmtrain.htm   -30-     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: October 17, 2002     Contact: Jim Meisner, Jr., DCR Public Relations Specialist, (804) 786-8442   Parks, natural area bond would impact valley    region   (RICHMOND) - Virginia's valley region would receive more than $5.8 million    for land preservation and state park construction projects if voters pass a    $119 million bond initiative on the ballot state-wide Nov. 5. Effects of the    2002 State Parks and Natural Areas Bond Act will be felt across the state.   ""Passage of the state parks and natural areas bond would improve our quality    of life by preserving open spaces and endangered natural areas, and provide    safe and unique places for families to enjoy the outdoors,"" said Department    of Conservation and Recreation Director Joseph H. Maroon. ""Statewide the    bond would provide for the acquisition of land for three new state parks, 10    new natural area preserves and finance repairs and improvements in each of the    34 state parks.""   Regionally, passage of the bond would mean an infusion of money with bond funds    proposed to acquire land for a new state park in the upper Shenandoah Valley.    Also the bond would allow for land acquisition for a new natural area preserve    in Augusta County, a new preserve in the region to protect Central Appalachian    caves and additions to a natural area preserve in Rockingham County.   DCR will only work with willing sellers when negotiating land purchases, Maroon    added.   Regional bond projects include:    Douthat State Park - One of the state's first parks, this facility in Bath    and Alleghany counties was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s    and is listed on the National Register of Historic Landmarks. Nearly $2.2 million    is targeted for additional cabins and the construction of an equestrian camping    area. With the development of new bridle trails through the national forest,    the proximity to the Virginia Horse Center at Lexington, and private riding    trails at the Homestead in Bath County, equestrian camping facilities are in    great demand.   Natural Area Preserves   Augusta County Wetlands - A new natural area preserve is proposed for Augusta    County to protect rare Shenandoah Valley natural ponds found only along the    western flank of the Blue Ridge in Augusta and Rockingham counties. These natural    wetlands, found nowhere else in the world, are highly threatened by drainage    and conversion. Ponds here provide habitat for plants federally listed as threatened    and state-listed as endangered.   Central Appalachian Caves - Though known to be extremely rich in caves, few    are protected in Virginia. Many are biologically significant and contain unique    subterranean species. A new natural area preserve in the mountains of western    Virginia would begin to protect this resource.   Rockingham County Addition - An addition to an existing Rockingham County natural    area preserve would protect a globally rare natural pond community in Augusta    and Rockingham counties. Natural ponds are increasingly rare, and this area    provides habitat for rare plants and animals.      Last year, seven million visitors to Virginia State Parks contributed approximately    $144 million to the state's economy.

""State parks are perfect places to enjoy the changing seasons,"" said    Department of Conservation and Recreation Joseph H. Maroon. ""Cabins have    air conditioning and heating so they're comfortable year-round.""   Cabins fill up quickly around holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, said    DCR State Parks Director Joe Elton.   ""Weekends are also popular times to stay in a state parks cabin,""    Elton said. ""We also have cabins available during the week in the mountains    or near rivers and lakes. One of the best ways to watch the sun rise in Virginia    is from a Virginia State Parks cabin or campsite.""   Virginia's state park system is the 2001-2003 National Gold Medal award winner    for excellence in park and recreation management, the nation's most prestigious    award for state parks.

Effects of the 2002 Parks and Natural Areas Bond Act will be felt across    the state.   ""Passage of the state parks and natural areas bond would improve our quality    of life by preserving open spaces and endangered natural areas, and provide    safe and clean places for families to enjoy the outdoors,"" said Department    of Conservation and Recreation Director Joseph H. Maroon. ""Statewide the    bond would provide for the acquisition of land for three new state parks, 10    new natural area preserves and finance repairs and improvements in each of the    34 state parks.""   Regionally, passage of the bond would mean an infusion of money across nearly    two dozen counties. Southwest Virginia would see land added to Hungry Mother,    Natural Tunnel, and Wilderness Road State Parks, additions to Natural Area Preserves    in Floyd, Lee and Montgomery Counties, new Natural Area Preserves in Floyd,    Montgomery, and Grayson and construction projects in six state parks. DCR will    only work with willing sellers when negotiating land purchases, Maroon added.   ""Some of our most popular state parks are in Southwest Virginia and will    benefit greatly if the bond passes,"" Maroon said.   Last year, seven million visitors to Virginia State Parks contributed approximately    $144 million to the state's economy.   Regional additions and construction projects include:   Parks    - Breaks Interstate Park - This regional park would receive $400,000 to construct    a new campground and upgrade the restaurant.    - Claytor Lake State Park - This state park in Pulaski County is targeted for    $3.4 million in improvements including new waterfront cabins with docks and    improved marina facilities.    - Grayson Highlands State Park - With voter approval of the bond, $950,000 would    be used to create a group camp area, build bathhouse facilities and improve    park utilities.    - Hungry Mother State Park - The Virginia Association for Parks and DCR have    identified land acquisition in Smyth County adjacent to the park as a top priority.    Campsites at the park are often sold out, and there is little land in the park    suitable for campground expansion. Acquisition and construction improvements    are expected to cost $1 million. Also at Hungry Mother, sediment has slowly    silted the man-made lake. About $1.4 million is targeted for dredging the lake    to its original contours.    - Natural Tunnel State Park - The acquisition of land adjacent to this state    park in Scott County is needed to develop an overnight cabin complex within    this mountain park. Additional fishing access on Stock Creek is also a goal.    Passage of the bond would allow the construction of this park's first overnight    cabins and improvements to campgrounds and a bathhouse at a cost of $3.5 million.    - New River Trail State Park - Covering four counties, the park would see $2.5    million in renovations to the historic Foster Falls complex, $850,000 dedicated    to developing trail access and trail safety improvements as well as improvements    to the water distribution system.    Wilderness Road State Park - Acquisition and protection of the Cumberland Mountain    range north and east of the park will preserve pioneer era vistas Daniel Boone    and countless settlers beheld on their way to the Ohio Territory. The bond would    provide     more than $2.5 million to renovate historic Karlan Mansion and to build a visitor    center, ranger residence, roads, picnic area, parking and utilities.   Natural Area Preserves    - Grayson County Wetlands - A new natural area preserve would protect a series    of headwater wetlands on the Blue Ridge Plateau in Grayson County. These wetlands    have a range of rare vegetation that provides habitat for 10 rare plant species,    one of the highest concentrations in the state.    - Montgomery County Barrens - A new preserve would protect hillsides underlain    by dolomite. This mineral-rich rock creates conditions for various rare vegetation,    including woodlands and barrens, and provides habitat for many rare plant species,    several of which are found nowhere else.    - Floyd County Wetlands - A new natural area preserve is proposed for the Blue    Ridge Plateau in Floyd County. Habitat for two globally rare animals would be    protected.     - Floyd County Addition - An addition to an existing natural area will further    protect numerous rare plant and animal species. The addition would allow for    watershed-wide control of an invasive plant threatening the site's rare wetland    plants.    - Lee County Addition - Additions to a Lee County natural area preserve would    protect additional cave habitats and karst terrain, globally rare limestone    woodlands, and many rare plant and animal species, including one found on only    one other site worldwide, and an animal found nowhere else.    - Montgomery County Addition - Additional land to an existing natural area would    provide habitat for many rare plant species, including one federally endangered    and two globally rare.

Effects    of the 2002 Parks and Natural Areas Bond Act will be felt across the state.   ""Passage of the state parks and natural areas bond would improve our quality    of life by preserving open spaces and endangered natural areas, and provide    safe and clean places for families to enjoy the outdoors,"" said Department    of Conservation and Recreation Director Joseph H. Maroon. ""Statewide the    bond would provide for the acquisition of land for three new state parks, 10    new natural area preserves and finance repairs and improvements in each of the    34 state parks.""   Regionally, passage of the bond would mean the acquisition of land for a new    water access park on the Middle Peninsula. The Tidewater region would also see    land added to Chippokes Plantation and Kiptopeke State Parks, additions to Natural    Area Preserves in Virginia Beach and Surry and Isle of Wight counties. New Natural    Area Preserves will be acquired in Isle of Wight and Matthews counties. DCR    will only work with willing sellers when negotiating land purchases, Maroon    added. Construction projects will also be funded in five nearby state parks.     Last year, seven million visitors to Virginia State Parks contributed approximately    $144 million to the state's economy.   ""The state parks in this region provide recreational access to the Chesapeake    Bay and several of its tributaries,"" said Maroon. ""Water access will    also be a key offering of the new Middle Peninsula state park.""   Regional acquisitions and construction projects include:    - Middle Peninsula area state park - The Virginia Outdoors Plan states the need    for a new water access state park in Virginia's Middle Peninsula, an area rich    in history and natural beauty. An exact location for the park has not been selected.    If the bond passes, DCR will work with local governments, public and private    landowners in the area to select and purchase suitable parklands. The state    will work only with willing land-sellers.     - Inholdings (lands partially or wholly surrounded by state park lands) or adjacent    properties that would round-out park boundaries and enhance park offerings have    been identified at Chippokes Plantation State Park in Surry County and Kiptopeke    State Park in Northampton County. The state will only acquire lands from willing    land sellers.     - Southern Coastal Plain Depression Ponds - A new natural area is proposed to    protect natural ponds found south of the James River on the Coastal Plain. These    natural wetlands are threatened by drainage and conversion. The ponds of this    proposed natural area preserve provide habitat for numerous rare plant and animal    species. The proposed area is located in Isle of Wight County.     - Middle Peninsula Wetland - A new preserve is proposed to protect natural pond    wetlands threatened by drainage and conversion. The ponds of this proposed natural    area provide habitat for numerous rare plant and animal species. The proposed    area is located in Matthews County.    - Isle of Wight Addition - An addition to the existing Antioch Pines Natural    Area Preserve and Blackwater Ecological Preserve is proposed to protect globally    rare sandy pinelands and pine barrens in southeast Virginia. This addition will    also enable restoration of rare vegetation found in the sandy region.    - Virginia Beach Addition - The bond proposes acquisition of more land for North    Landing River NAP. This would add to and provide buffer for globally rare and    highly threatened marsh and swamp vegetation. These wetlands provide habitat    for numerous rare plant and animal species.    Surry County Addition - An addition to Dendron Swamp Natural Area Preserve is    proposed to protect an old-growth stand of tupelo and bald cypress along the    Blackwater River as well as buffer already protected stands. Some of these trees    along the river are 1,200 years old. They provide excellent habitat for a globally    rare animal.    - False Cape State Park - At the southern end of Virginia Beach, False Cape    State Park would receive $750,000 to build a visitor center and administrative    complex with modern restroom facilities. Such additions will greatly enhance    the park user's visit.    - First Landing State Park - This park on the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia Beach    is the system's most visited. It draws nearly two million visitors a year. Improvements    totaling $2.52 million include campground water and electric hookups, new bathhouses,    improvements to the Chesapeake Bay Center and Amphitheater, and expansion and    renovation of the Trail Center.     York River State Park - This day-use park on the banks of the York River in    James City County would receive $500,000 to make improvements to the Croaker    Landing boat ramp built in 1980. Monies would improve the existing parking lot    and make improvements to the boat dock. Portions of the dock would be re-engineered    to provide easier access from boats to the dock.     - Kiptopeke State Park - Located on the Chesapeake Bay side of Virginia's Eastern    Shore, Kiptopeke is one of the country's most significant bird watching locations.    Bond funds would be used to construct several five-bedroom family lodges ($2,500,000).    An additional $250,000 would go to improving electrical and water service to    the park's existing campground.     - Chippokes Plantation State Park - With bond funds, this state park in Surry    County would receive $4.62 million for renovation of historic structures, water    system replacement, pool concession facility improvements and campground expansion.    With Jamestown's 400th anniversary in 2007, this work must be done before countless    visitors from around the world visit Tidewater Virginia.

""Statewide the    bond would provide for the acquisition of land for three new state parks, 10    new natural area preserves and finance repairs and improvements in each of the    34 state parks.""   Regionally, passage of the bond would mean the acquisition of land for a new    water access park on the North Fork of the Shenandoah River and new natural    area preserves in Culpeper County and the northern Shenandoah Valley. The northern    portion of the state would also see land added to Lake Anna and Sky Meadows    state parks. DCR will only work with willing sellers when negotiating land purchases,    Maroon added. Construction projects will also be funded in six nearby state    parks and one natural area.    Last year, seven million visitors to Virginia State Parks contributed approximately    $144 million to the state's economy.   ""The state parks in the northern portion of Virginia provide water access,    history and a chance to enjoy nature,"" said Maroon. ""The acquisition    of a new state park and two natural area preserves in the region also helps    preserve our precious open space.""   Regional acquisitions and construction projects include:    - Seven Bends Area River state park - The Virginia Outdoors Plan identified    the need to develop a new state park along the Shenandoah in the Seven Bends    area to conserve some of this beautiful river's frontage and to enhance recreation    opportunities. Increasing demand for river access makes this one of the Commonwealth's    top new park priorities. It is expected that in such a setting, future generations    of Virginians would enjoy this park with various recreational and overnight    facilities.    - Northern Virginia Woodland - A new natural area preserve is proposed in Culpeper    County in the Culpeper Basin on Virginia's Piedmont. The flat, eons-old bedrock    of this basin provides suitable conditions for mineral rich bedrock glades and    the development of rare oak woodland vegetation and a number of rare species.    - Northern Virginia Appalachian Caves - A new natural area preserve in an area    known to be rich in caves. Virginia has a plethora of biologically significant    cave sites, many of which support unique subterranean species found nowhere    else in the world. Few cave sites are protected in the region. The new natural    area preserve is proposed for northern Virginia's Ridge and Valley Province    to initiate protection of this resource.    - Inholdings (lands partially or wholly surrounded by state park lands) or adjacent    properties that would round-out park boundaries and enhance park offerings have    been identified at Lake Anna State Park in Spotsylvania County and Sky Meadows    State Park in Fauquier County. The state will only acquire lands from willing    land sellers.     - Caledon Natural Area - This natural area on the Potomac River in King George    County is one of the country's most significant summering spots for the American    Bald Eagle. The area is slated to receive funds for improvements to the existing    trail system.     - Lake Anna State Park - The bond proposes $4.5 million for new cabins and campsites    in this state park located in Spotsylvania County. Lake Anna has long been one    of Virginia's most heavily visited day use parks for swimming, boating, fishing,    hiking and horseback riding. Cabins and campgrounds have been targeted for this    park for more than a decade.    - Leesylvania State Park - This Prince William County state park would receive    $300,000 for construction of new boating piers and a picnic shelter. This park's    visitor center details the history of Leesylvania, the ancestral home of Virginia's    famous Fairfax and Lee families. The park is among Virginia's most visited.    - Mason Neck State Park - This Fairfax County setting on historic Mason Neck    is part of a public complex managed by county, state and federal governments.    Nearly $1 million is targeted for a new park administrative complex to replace    outdated mobile facilities, and for road upgrades to improve access to hiking    trails and water.    - Raymond R. ""Andy"" Guest, Jr.-Shenandoah River State Park - Throughout    history the Shenandoah has been among the nation's most legendary rivers. This    park was purchased with 1992 bond funds. The 2002 bond proposal targets nearly    $6.2 million to build a modern campground, an overnight cabin complex and a    visitor center to serve the rapidly growing number of park users. Since the    1930s, state park campgrounds and cabins have served generations of Virginians,    and demand for these facilities has grown stronger in recent years.    - Sky Meadows State Park - Renowned philanthropist Paul Mellon gave this Fauquier    County property to Virginia's citizens. It serves as Virginia's northern terminus    of the Appalachian Trail and includes a historic 1850s farm with scenic mountain    and valley vistas. About $450,000 is proposed to expand existing primitive campgrounds,    build Appalachian Trail shelters and develop a new picnic area.    - Westmoreland State Park - Located on the Potomac River on the history-rich    Northern Neck between Washington's Birthplace and Stratford Hall. The park will    receive $1.15 million to replace an aging complex and to build a new visitor    and birding center.

Entrees are being accepted though Sept. 9 and volunteers for the race    are still needed.     Competitors will bike 40 miles, canoe 12 miles and run 13.1 miles along southwestern    Virginia's 57-mile-long New River Trail State Park. The race is presented by    the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation.     Last year 191 people entered the race, said New River Trail State Park Manager    Mark Hufeisen. ""This is our third year and plans are running smoothly,    we have more support from the localities, from the athletic communities and    competitors, and more interest from our supporters,"" Huffeisn said. ""This    year's race really will be the biggest and best yet.""     The race begins in the Town of Fries and also involves the counties of Grayson,    Carroll, Wythe and Pulaski, and the City of Galax.    The Wythe County Days Festival will be held in conjunction with the race at    the Foster Falls complex. There will be arts and crafts, music, food and plenty    to do for friends, family and competitors, both during and after the race.     ""The race demonstrates the positive economic impact our state park has    on the region,"" said DCR Director Joseph H. Maroon, who was appointed in    March. ""I'm pleased DCR is a partner in continuing the racing tradition    in the park.""     The race is an excellent showcase for the beauty of the park as well as the    region, said DCR State Parks Director Joe Elton. ""Competitors, their families    and support crews travel through some of the most visually appealing sections    of Virginia to get to one of the most unique state parks in Virginia,""    Elton said. ""Foster Falls, with its picnic areas, equestrian area, campsites,    restored historic buildings and river access, is quickly becoming a recreational    focal point for the region.""

Environmental and Developmental Services (757)    890-3790   State and York County reach agreement for    mosquito control at Grafton Ponds   (RICHMOND, VA) -- The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation and    York County Department of Environmental and Developmental Services reached an    agreement for mosquito control at the Grafton Ponds Natural Area Preserve. After    site visits and meetings with York County mosquito control officials, other    local officials and Virginia Department of Health officials, a standard was    determined that protects public safety as well as the sensitive natural resources    at Grafton Ponds.   York County approved this standard, well within its normal operating procedure    for larvicide treatment. The standard uses the county-recommended larval count    of 25 or more larvae combined with water levels at Grafton Ponds, based upon    a representative surveillance pond.    Larvicide will be applied to the ponds when county officials determine it is    necessary under the standard. This number and methodology was based on recommendations    from York County and the Virginia Department of Health.    ""We have come to a workable compromise that addresses both environmental    concerns and the interests of Edgehill residents,"" stated Jim Rindfleisch,    York County Department of Environmental and Developmental Services.    DCR's initial actions resulted from raising the bar on when control would start.    The department based the intent upon U.S. Center for Disease Control Guidelines    and natural resources concerns.     Joseph H. Maroon, newly appointed agency director at DCR, asked his staff to    revise its guidelines to ensure early prevention is a key part of plan. DCR    staff has been working on this for the past two weeks.   ""DCR and York County together will take preventive action that mosquito    control officials deem necessary to address public concerns and safety, and    meet DCR's conservation mission,"" Maroon said.   Because the dry year has resulted in mostly empty ponds at the Grafton Ponds    Natural Area Preserve, they are not supporting mosquito larvae. According to    onsite surveys by York County officials, ponds with no water don't have enough    larvae to warrant applying larvicide under normal operating procedures. In other    words, York County would not have treated the ponds to-date this year because    of the low numbers of larvae present.   Tom Smith, DCR Natural Heritage division director, noted that previous articles    focused on the connection between chemical mosquito control and endangered species.    However, DCR is most concerned for the continuing functioning of the natural    system. At an appropriate time, a level of mosquito control determined by technical    experts serves citizens' health interests and can be accomplished while also    protecting sensitive ecological resources.   -30-            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: June 15, 2002     Contact: Jim Meisner, Jr., DCR Public Relations Specialist, (804) 786-8442   Governor Warner designates    June Virginia State Parks Month   (RICHMOND) - Governor Mark R. Warner has designated June 2002 as Virginia State    Parks Month and recognizes June 15, 2002 as Virginia State Parks Day.

Mark Warner recently declared June as Virginia Rivers Month.    June 2002 also marks the 30th anniversary of the nation's Clean Water Act.   The governor's office issued a proclamation declaring, ""Virginia's rivers    are arteries of commerce and sources of water and nourishment that benefit our    Commonwealth's communities, homes and businesses.""   The proclamation encourages all Virginians to use responsibly and preserve    Virginia's rivers for the enjoyment of future generations and for the good of    the state's environment.   ""From the coast to lush green mountains, Virginia communities are surrounded    by unrivaled splendor, including Virginia's precious and important rivers,""    said Joseph H. Maroon, director of the Virginia Department of Conservation and    Recreation (DCR). ""The Commonwealth's natural resource base is in part    why this state is such a special place to live, work, recreate and visit.""   The proclamation also recognizes that Virginia's rivers are among the most    beautiful of its natural resources. Nineteen river segments are designated Scenic    Rivers; 10 more have been evaluated and qualify for the designation, according    to DCR's 2002 Virginia Outdoors Plan.   In addition to their natural benefits, Virginia's rivers are used by industry,    for commercial fishing and hydropower. These waterways provide innumerable sources    of recreation for the state's citizens and attract visitors to the state.    Of the top 10 recreational activities Virginians enjoy, three are water-dependent:    swimming, fishing and boating. Figures from the American Sportfishing Association    in 1996 show that state anglers helped create more than 20,000 jobs and $441    million in income.   Citizen demand for ""combined"" stream use in Virginia - fishing, human-powered    boating, rafting and tubing - is projected to increase almost 40 percent by    the year 2010.    In the most recent Chesapeake Bay Agreement, a 15-year commitment among Virginia,    Washington, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, Virginia is responsible for developing    66 new river access sites and 500 miles of water trails by the year 2003.

Mark R. Warner demonstrated his support of Virginia's outdoors    today with a canoe ride in Raymond R. ""Andy"" Guest Jr. Shenandoah    River State Park in Warren County.   Joined by local officials and outdoor enthusiasts, Warner paddled 3.5 miles    before meeting state parks supporters in a nearby picnic shelter to discuss    the $119 million 2002 Commonwealth of Virginia Parks and Natural Areas Referendum.   ""Passage of the parks and natural areas bond is vitally important for    the future of Virginia's natural resources and open spaces,"" Warner said.    ""This initiative will protect rare plants and animals and preserve irreplaceable    open spaces and endangered natural areas. This will also allow more Virginians    more opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors.""   Visitation in Virginia State Parks increased from 3.8 million in 1991 to 7.1    million in 2001.   ""For too long, Virginia State Parks and natural areas have been overlooked    in the funding process, and this needs to change,"" Warner said. ""By    voting 'yes' for this bond, Virginians will make lasting, permanent improvements    to state parks and natural areas and will increase the quality of life for future    generations of Virginians across the commonwealth. Voting 'yes' is the natural    choice.""   Nationally, Virginia ranks 49th in per capita state spending, 50th in terms    of percentage of state budget and 47th in acreage per capita.    ""The environmental impact of this bond is important, but equally important    is the economic impact,"" Warner said. ""In 2001, state park visitors    contributed $144 million to the state's economy, and nearly 40 percent of park    visitors come from outside Virginia. The $119 million bond will have a lasting    economic impact immediately and for years to come.""    Managed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia's    state park system is the 2001-2003 National Gold Medal award winner for excellence    in park and recreation management. The award was presented by the National Sporting    Goods Association's Sports Foundation Inc. in cooperation with the National    Recreation and Park Association.   The Nature Conservancy recognized Virginia's natural areas program in 1994    as the best in the Western Hemisphere.   ""Virginia's environment is first rate, and the envy of the nation,""    Warner said. ""We owe it to our children and to future generations to further    protect our natural wonders, and passage of this bond will help do that.""   According to a 2001 poll conducted for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, The Nature    Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land, public support for preserving and    protecting state lands is at an all-time high.    - 96 percent believe Virginians owe it to future generations ""to protect    land, water and wildlife for their use and enjoyment.""    - 89 percent rate ""preserving and protecting open space"" as important.        - 82 percent of those polled believe Virginia's natural areas soon will be lost    forever unless we act now to protect them.   - 30 -     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: June 3, 2002     Contact: Lenora Rose, (276) 579-7712   Grayson Highlands State Park to host music    festival June 15   (RICHMOND) - For a sampling of American roots music popularized by the likes    of O Brother, Where Art Thou, bring a lawn chair to the eighth annual Wayne    C.

""Modest price increases are necessary to maintain the high standards of    quality service that our millions of visitors expect,"" said DCR Director    Joseph H. Maroon. ""While the state parks budget has remained stagnant or    been cut, the system has experienced a nearly decade-long expansion in programs,    activities, offerings, and in acreage owned and managed.""   Rates will increase for cabin, campground and picnic shelter rentals as well    as daily parking and boat launch fees. Lifetime and annual passes will continue    to be available and offer a significant savings over daily fees.   Virginia residents will continue to receive discounts on cabin rentals, and    discounted parking passes for seniors are still available.   Although the Commonwealth of Virginia ranks 50th in the country in per capita    spending on parks, Virginia's state park system is the 2001-2003 National Gold    Medal award winner for excellence in park and recreation management, presented    by the National Sporting Goods Association's Sports Foundation Inc. in cooperation    with the National Recreation and Park Association.   - 30 -       Office of the Governor     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE     Governor April 9, 2002   Contact: Ellen Qualls    Phone: (804) 786-2211, x2379    Cell Phone: (804) 393-9429    Internet:  www.governor.state.va.us       Governor proposes dedicated revenue source for open space    and improved water quality     RICHMOND - Governor Mark R. Warner announced today that he will amend Senate    Bill 592 to impose a $5 per-ton fee on trash deposited in Virginia landfills,    a change that he said will bring Virginia more into line with neighboring states    and generate needed funds for open space preservation, water quality improvement,    recycling, solid waste management, and the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields    and abandoned or contaminated waste sites.    Speaking at a news conference in James River Park in Richmond, the Governor    said his plan, known as the Commonwealth Conservation Initiative, represents    ""an important conservation proposal that will provide a lasting benefit    to all Virginians.""     ""With the proceeds from these additional fees on trash disposal, we will    generate more than $75 million annually for the Commonwealth's critical needs    in open space preservation and water quality improvement,"" said Governor    Warner.    The amendments are supported by a strong group of legislators from both parties.    Among the legislators supporting the proposal are: Speaker of the House Vance    Wilkins, President Pro Tempore of the Senate John Chichester, Senate Minority    Leader Richard Saslaw, Senators Emmett Hanger, Mary Margaret Whipple, Henry    Marsh, Thomas Norment, Bo Trumbo, Ken Stolle, John Edwards, and Creigh Deeds,    Delegates Vince Callahan, Kirk Cox, David Albo, Mary Christian, Brian Moran,    Vic Thomas, Ken Plum, Harvey Morgan, Jack Rollison, Albert Pollard, Jr., Jeannemarie    Devolites, and Frank Hargrove.    ""I am pleased that legislators from both parties are strongly supportive    of this proposal to help address our growing concern with trash and at the same    time provide much needed resources for open space, water quality, parks, and    farmland preservation,"" Governor Warner said. ""Virginia has some of    the lowest fees for trash in the region, and this increase will properly move    us toward parity with other states.""     The United State Supreme Court recently declined to hear an appeal of a lower    court ruling that a Virginia law banning out-of-state trash was unconstitutional.    Virginia is the number two importer of out-of-state trash in the country, behind    only Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania legislature is on the verge of raising their    current $3.25 tipping fee by as much as five dollars.    The proposal supported by Governor Warner and the legislators would impose    a five-dollar per ton fee on solid waste disposed of at a Virginia landfill.    The funds generated, approximately $76 million, would be used to:    * Preserve open space through the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation and    the Virginia Outdoors Foundation (40%).    * Provide grants to all Virginia localities for a wide variety of natural resources    purposes (35%).    * Ensure clean water throughout the Commonwealth through the Water Quality Improvement    Fund (19%).    * Assist our inner cities with environmental cleanup and redevelopment through    the Virginia Brownfields Restoration and Economic Redevelopment Assistance Fund    (5%).    * Administer the Fund (1%).    The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar measure in 1999 to    impose a tipping fee on trash, but it was subsequently vetoed by then-Governor    James Gilmore.    Senate Bill 592 relates to fees charged by the Virginia Department of Environmental    Quality. The bill's sponsor is Senator Emmett Hanger.   # # #     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: March 29, 2002     Contact: Jim Meisner, Jr., DCR Public Relations Specialist, (804) 786-8442   Sailor's Creek Civil War battle re-enactment    April 6-7   (SAILOR'S CREEK, VA.) - The smell of gunpowder will again fill the air at Sailor's    Creek Battlefield Historic State Park during reenactments of the last major    battle of the Civil War. Sponsored by the Virginia Department of Conservation    and Recreation and the Sayler's Creek Reenactment and Preservation Committee    Inc., the commemoration of the battle will be April 6-7.   Visitors will return to this quiet crossroads of Virginia for the 137th anniversary    of the battle that sealed the fate of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army    of Northern Virginia and precipitated the surrender at nearby Appomattox 72    hours later.   Living history demonstrations are scheduled Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and    Sunday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and include Confederate and Federal encampments,    demonstrations, and tours of the historic Hillsman House, which served as a    Union field hospital. A reenactment of the battle of Little Sailor's Creek will    begin Saturday at 1:30 p.m., concluding with a ceremony honoring the men who    died on that field of battle. The first reenactment of the battle of Lockett's    Farm will be Sunday at 1:30 p.m.   Daily admission, including parking, is $10 per car, $15 per nine-passenger    van and $50 per charter bus. Refreshments and Civil War commemorative items    will be on sale.   The park is in Amelia County on State Route 617.

DCR is now accepting applications for the inaugural two-week session of the    Virginia State Parks Youth Conservation Corps (YCC), scheduled for July 28 through    Aug. 10.   ""The Youth Conservation Corps is an exciting and challenging opportunity    for students 15-18 years of age to serve the commonwealth,"" said DCR State    Parks Director Joe Elton. ""Service to others is an honorable, character-building    pursuit, and the YCC will fill a need in our parks and in the lives of young    people.""   YCC participants will assist with an assortment of projects in Virginia State    Parks, including wildlife and fisheries habitat improvement, trail and campground    construction and restoration, timber and shoreline improvement, and landscape    beautification, to name a few, Elton said.   The 2002 YCC camps will be held at Claytor Lake State Park in Dublin; False    Cape State Park in Virginia Beach; Hungry Mother State Park in Marion; Pocahontas    State Park in Chesterfield; Raymond R. ""Andy"" Guest Jr. Shenandoah    River State Park in Warren County; and Westmoreland State Park in Westmoreland    County.   ""These young people will make permanent and important contributions to    our parks,"" Elton said. ""At the same time, they will learn valuable    life lessons that will raise their awareness of environmental stewardship, teach    them job skills, discipline and the importance of teamwork, and it will improve    their self-esteem and confidence.""   The YCC is modeled after the federal service program, AmeriCorps, and the depression-era    Civilian Conservation Corps that constructed the original six Virginia State    Parks.   ""The two-week program is open to young men and women between 15 and 18,""    said YCC Coordinator Gaston Rouse Jr. ""YCC crew-members will be provided    room, board, tee-shirts and work-related equipment, and will receive a $200    stipend at the end of the two weeks. The memories and experiences they take    away will last forever.""   Adult supervisors at least 21 years old also are needed for the program.   The YCC application deadline for both students and supervisors is May 1.   ""The supervisors will serve as leaders and direct all activities of their    crew,"" Rouse said. ""It's a hard job that isn't for everyone, but the    rewards are great. Supervisors have the opportunity to make a difference in    our parks, and in the lives of the young corps members.""   Supervisor applicants will undergo a criminal background check before being    hired. Supervisors will receive $28 per diem a $1,000 stipend upon completion    of the program.

More than 250 years later, the Virginia Department of Conservation    and Recreation (DCR) has signed an agreement with the Foundation of the Flora    of Virginia Project Inc. supporting the foundation's development of the first    comprehensive Virginia flora since Clayton's work.    A flora is an identification manual of plants that grow naturally in an area.    The manual will be used in the field, classroom and library as a key reference    to Virginia's plants.    DCR will provide office space, equipment and staff support to the flora project.    The foundation has lead responsibility for developing the manual and privately    raising the more than $1 million dollars in production costs.   Anyone now interested in Virginia's plant life has to work with out-of-date    floras developed for neighboring regions or states. These floras lack critical    components to make them accessible to Virginians. The format and text of this    new work will be designed for use by Virginia educators to introduce the state's    plants to its citizens while greatly enriching the knowledge of our more advanced    botanists.    According to DCR Acting Director Leon E. App, a modern flora will help citizens,    educators, conservationists, scientists and natural resource professionals provide    reliable information about Virginia's plant life. ""This resource tool will    be useful to citizens, land planners, and local and state political leaders    in making more informed land use decisions,"" said App.   ""A well informed public is key to confronting environmental challenges,""    said Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources W. Tayloe Murphy Jr. ""Helping    Virginians better understand the natural world is critical to conservation of    the natural treasures that sustain us.""    A nine-member board leads the foundation. Board members are Dr. Donna Ware,    former curator of the College of William and Mary herbarium and a coauthor of    the Atlas of the Virginia Flora; Michael Lipford, vice president and Virginia    executive director of the Nature Conservancy; Nicky Staunton, president of the    Virginia Native Plant Society; Dr. Chip Morgan, representative of the Wintergreen    Nature Foundation; Marion Lobstein, vice president of the Virginia Academy of    Science; Tom Smith, DCR director of natural heritage; Mike Garson, a Virginia    attorney, Joslin Gallatin, formerly with the Foundation of the State Arboretum,    and Chris Ludwig, DCR's chief biologist and executive director and board president    of the Flora of Virginia Project Foundation Inc.    The flora's primary authors, Ludwig and Alan Weakley, also head a 50-member    advisory team of technical experts from across Virginia. Developing a comprehensive    statewide flora is expected to take five years. The guide will contain as many    as 4,000 illustrations. Ludwig is looking for illustrators interested in working    on the flora.

Virginians can now help do both when they file their state tax returns.   Schedule ADJ allows taxpayers to contribute any or all their tax refund to    either the Open Space Conservation Fund or the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund.    And, there's an added benefit: these contributions are tax-deductible on next    year's income tax returns.   ""A recent survey of Virginians revealed that 92 percent felt it was important    to protect open space resources,"" said W. Tayloe Murphy Jr., Virginia Secretary    of Natural Resources. ""The Chesapeake Bay is also seen as both a state    and national treasure. Contributions to either fund helps preserve these resources    critical to the commonwealth and to future generations.""   Designate your voluntary contribution on line 24 of Schedule ADJ, to accompany    the individual income tax return Form 760. If you choose the ""Open Space    Conservation and Recreation Fund,"" write in the code numbers 6-8. If you    choose the ""Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund,"" write in the code numbers    7-1.   These voluntary contribution funds are an easy means of supporting natural    resources in Virginia. Money designated for the Open Space fund has helped purchase    state natural area preserves that protect rare species. This fund is also used    to acquire land for recreational purposes and as matching grants to localities    for meeting their community outdoor recreational needs.    Contributing to the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund has been an option for    several years, and the level of funding is on the rise. The money is spent on    pollution-reducing projects throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which makes    up over half of the state's land mass.    Of course, Virginia taxpayers who don't receive refunds can also contribute    to these funds directly.   Contact the Virginia Department of Taxation at (804) 367-8031 or online at    www.tax.state.va.us. For questions about either contribution fund, call the    Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation at (804) 786-7961.   -30-       FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: February 6, 2002     Contact: Lois delBueno, Public Relations Specialist, (804) 786-7961   Virginia poultry farmers meet deadline for    required nutrient management plans   (RICHMOND, VA) Nutrient management plans have been approved for 1,068 poultry    operations across the state covering 121,848 acres of agricultural land receiving    poultry waste. These plans were developed by the Oct. 1, 2001 deadline for regulatory    permits established through legislation two years ago. The plans were approved    by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation.   According to department officials, these statistics account for at least 98    percent of farms identified as requiring a permit. In the Commonwealth, poultry    producers with more than 11,000 turkeys or more than 20,000 chickens are required    to have Virginia Pollution Abatement (VPA) General Permit to regulate the storage    and land application of poultry waste.    The permit is accompanied by a DCR-approved nutrient management plan that outlines    steps to prevent waste from running off land and into state waters.    Public- and private-sector professional plan writers, poultry companies and    growers all had roles in meeting the deadline.   ""We should acknowledge poultry companies' assistance determining which    growers needed updated or new plans, collecting litter samples and helping schedule    farm visits,"" said Leon E. App, DCR acting director.   While some growers in Virginia had existing plans, those needed modification    to meet additional requirements of the regulation. For many operations, however,    plans had to be developed and written.    Each nutrient management plan identifies adequate poultry waste storage sites    that meet the requirements of the legislation. These are: poultry waste stockpiles    must be covered within 14 days, new storage facilities can't be in the 100-year    floodplain or on soils with a water table in close proximity to the surface,    and must prevent contact with surface or ground water. The legislation also    requires periodic soil and waste monitoring to determine nutrient levels. Plans    developed or revised after October 1, 2001 must be limited on both nitrogen    and phosphorus.    ""Cooperation from the Virginia Poultry Federation and poultry companies    was invaluable in achieving a monumental task,"" said Jack E. Frye, DCR    soil and water conservation director. ""This illustrates partnerships we've    fostered to continue a conservation ethic in the agricultural community.""   Twenty-one meetings around the state covered the permitting process, nutrient    management planning and options for managing poultry litter. These meetings    were critical for educating growers and relaying the importance of beginning    the process as early as possible. DCR, Virginia Cooperative Extension, Virginia    Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia Farm Bureau Federation, Virginia    Poultry Federation and Virginia poultry companies conducted the meetings. More    than 1,200 poultry growers, managers and poultry company representatives attended.

Dixie Sporting Goods Co. of Richmond nominated    the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, which manages Virginia's    state parks.    ""This national recognition verifies what Virginians have known for years    -- that our state parks are among the best in the country,"" said Governor    Gilmore. ""This recognition from such a prestigious association will help    showcase our state parks as an attractive destination for Virginians and visiting    tourists.""   The National Sporting Goods Association is the world's largest sporting goods    trade association, representing more than 22,000 retailer/dealer outlets and    3,000 suppliers, product manufacturers and sales agents. Its sports foundation    began the gold medal awards in 1965 and added a state parks category in 1997.    The National Gold Medal and State Park Award is given in odd-numbered years    to honor the nation's outstanding state park system for excellence in the field    of park and recreation management and their contributions in providing park,    recreation and leisure services to the citizens of their state.   ""In managing Virginia's state parks, we have remained true to the original    vision established in the 1930s, "" said DCR Director David Brickley. ""We've    done this by actively managing our natural resources, retaining the natural    beauty of our parks and complementing that beauty by incorporating modern improvements    like central air and heat in cabins and state-of-the-art environmental education    centers. Our state parks have benefited from the combined expertise of our department    staff in areas such as open space and recreational planning, the use of conservation    best management practices, natural heritage resource management and even dam    management.""   Six Virginia state parks opened June 15, 1936, making Virginia the first state    in the United States to dedicate all of its parks on the same day. Many of those    facilities have been restored and are still in use today.    ""Hundreds of DCR employees and countless volunteers dedicated tens of    thousands of hours of hard work over 65 years to make Virginia state parks the    best in the nation,"" said DCR State Parks Director Joe Elton. ""Virginia    now joins an elite list of state park systems honored with the Gold Medal.""   A finalist two years ago, Virginia joins the 1999 winner, the Florida Department    of Environmental Protection's Division of Recreation and Parks, and 1997's winner,    the Ohio Division of Parks and Recreation.

The designation is part of a new voluntary    program seeking to reduce pollution in Virginia's coastal waters by helping    marinas and recreational boaters become more environmentally sensitive.    Marinas receiving the designation today in a ceremony at Two Rivers Yacht Club    in Williamsburg were Ginny Point Marina, Cobbs Creek; Hampton Public Piers,    Hampton; Salt Ponds Marina Resort, Hampton; Severn River Marina, Hayes; and    Two Rivers Yacht Club. The awards were presented by Virginia Assistant Secretary    of Natural Resources Elwyn Darden and David G. Brickley, director, Virginia    Department of Conservation and Recreation.    The marinas are also recognized with ""Environmental Enterprise"" status    in the Virginia Environmental Excellence Program, which offers incentives to    encourage the adoption of environmental management systems and pollution prevention    efforts.    The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Virginia Department    of Environmental Quality and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science have worked    with the Tidewater Marine Trades Association, the Virginia Association of Marine    Industries and others in the private sector to develop the Virginia Clean Marina    Program. It provides technical assistance and voluntary recognition for marinas    and other boating access points.    ""We're pleased to recognize these marinas for being the first to meet    the requirements of clean marina designation,"" said Darden. ""Their    voluntary efforts will help ensure Virginians will always be able to enjoy our    waterways."" Approximately 1,000 marinas in Virginia are eligible to vie    for recognition as a ""Virginia Clean Marina.""   ""These marina operators have backed up their pledges to participate by    meeting the stringent criteria set forth by this new program,"" said Brickley.    ""This shows their commitment to the future of Virginia's water quality.    But hopefully promoting themselves as a Virginia Clean Marina will also have    tangible results for their business today."" Studies of similar programs    in other states have shown that marinas recognized as environmentally friendly    have lower vacancy rates.   The Virginia Coastal Program at DEQ funds the program through a grant from    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A Marina Technical and    Environmental Advisory Committee made up of representatives from state agencies,    the marine trade industry, and the recreational boating and environmental communities    has developed a Virginia Clean Marina Guidebook that provides steps marina operators    and recreational boaters can take to protect and improve Virginia's coastal    waters. The committee also assists in the program's marina designation process.   Marinas seeking designation can complete a self-assessment checklist followed    by a site visit by members of the advisory committee. The Marina Technical Assistance    Program at VIMS will work with the marina to meet minimum program requirements.    Marina operators seeking more information on the program can visit the Clean    Marina website at  http://www.deq.state.va.us/vacleanmarina/ .   -30-             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Date: Oct. 31, 2001   Contact: Jim Meisner, Jr., DCR Public Relations Specialist, (804) 786-8442   Virginia State Parks offers free admission    Veterans Day weekend to support national ""weekend of unity and hope""   (RICHMOND) - Virginia State Parks will waive all parking and admission fees    over the Veteran's Day holiday weekend, Nov. 10-12, in support of the recovery    efforts of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

A packaged set of six maps covers 100 miles of river    from the Nation's Capital to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and a total of    89 sites in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia.    The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and the Maryland    Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed the Potomac River water trail    as a joint project. DCR received a matching grant from the National Park Service    to develop the trail as part of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, a system    of water trails, parks, refuges and other maritime sites in the Chesapeake Bay    watershed.    ""The Potomac River Water Trail is one of the country's first water trails    being developed jointly by two states in cooperation with the National Park    Service,"" said DCR Director David G. Brickley. ""Recognized as an American    Heritage River, the Potomac has the natural and historic resources to make this    a trail a world-class attraction.""   ""Nationally, water trails are becoming one of the most popular components    of the growing eco-tourism trade,"" said Verna E. Harrison, Assistant Secretary    of Chesapeake Bay and Watershed Programs for the Maryland Department of Natural    Resources. ""Providing an enhanced recreational and educational experience    also helps foster a greater appreciation for our waterways.""   The six-map set highlights access points from D.C. to the Chesapeake along    both sides of the river. Information is provided on each access point including    the availability of restrooms, boating facilities, historical interest, overnight    accommodations, camping and food service. It is one of the first water trail    guides to include GPS (Global Positioning System) information on access sites.    The guides also include boating safety tips and emergency phone numbers.    ""This is a guide that every boater, kayaker and canoeist will want to    keep on hand,"" said Brickley. ""It will become an invaluable part of    any trip along this part of the Potomac.""   Planners from DCR and DNR met with local government officials, chambers of    commerce and others to develop the trail's concept and details for the map guides.    Many of the 89 access sites included in the maps are locally owned and operated.    Local attractions are seen as one of the primary beneficiaries of the new guide.     In addition, the water trail helps meet the public access commitments in the    new Chesapeake Bay Agreement - Chesapeake 2000. Virginia, Maryland and the National    Park Service are all members of the cooperative Chesapeake Bay Program, a watershed    partnership to restore and protect the Bay and its rivers.   The guides can be purchased for $5 at Virginia and Maryland state parks along    the Potomac River. Maps can also be ordered by calling the Virginia DCR reservation    center at 1-800-933-PARK or by calling the Maryland Greenway Commission at (410)    260-8780.

The    secretary announced that conservation easements that prohibit future subdivision    of a privately owned farm, limit development of buildings and allow continued    agricultural usage have been acquired.   In addition, 1,107 acres have been dedicated as a Virginia Natural Area Preserve    and 35 acres of pasture will be restored to wetlands. The land remains in private    ownership and is not open to the public.    The agreement with the landowner, James Nash, was negotiated by the Trust for    Public Land, a national nonprofit land conservation organization, which orchestrated    a partnership of the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, the    Virginia Outdoors Foundation, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the U.S. Fish and    Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy and the Army Corps of Engineers.    ""This is a tremendously significant piece of property,"" said Secretary    Woodley. ""When combined with Caledon Natural Area, five miles of Potomac    River shoreline and more than 4,000 acres of forest, farmland and marshes have    been preserved as prime American Bald Eagle habitat. These preservation actions    also move us closer to meeting the land preservation goals set in the new Chesapeake    Bay Agreement.""    The property has approximately 350 acres of open fields and pasture. The remainder    is a mix of upland and bottomland hardwood forests and approximately 250 acres    of tidal marshes along Chotank Creek. The farm also has three eagle nests, all    active last year.    The Virginia Outdoors Foundation and Chesapeake Bay Foundation will monitor    and enforce the easements. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation    will develop and implement a resource management plan for the newly established,    1,107-acre Chotank Creek Natural Area Preserve. The Nature Conservancy, using    funds from the Virginia Wetlands Restoration Trust Fund administered by the    U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will restore approximately 35 acres of pasture    into wetlands.    ""The Chotank Creek Natural Area Preserve marks only the second time that    private land has been dedicated in Virginia,"" said DCR Director David G.    Brickley. ""We hope Mr. Nash's efforts will help start a trend.""    ""We are pleased to have been able to bring together many partners to make    this important conservation transaction possible and are grateful to Mr. Nash    and his family for ensuring the permanent protection of this important property,""    said Debi Osborne, Chesapeake Field Office director for the Trust for Public    Land. ""Protecting this important property preserves not only land of local    and historical significance, but also protects the Potomac River and the Chesapeake    Bay watershed.""   Mr. Nash has lived on the property since the early 1940s and has long been    interested in preservation efforts. Beginning in the early 1980s Mr. Nash served    on the task force appointed by then-Governor Charles Robb, to develop a management    plan for Caledon Natural Area. He also hopes to establish a private foundation    to own and manage the land in future generations. ""I hope that this may    become a living educational example,"" said Mr. Nash.    This 4,000-acre area is one of the most significant summering spots for the    American Bald Eagle on the East Coast, with more than 60 eagles spotted at one    time.   -30-     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Date: August 1, 2001     Contact: Gary Waugh, PR Manager, (804) 786-5045   Virginia's coastal nonpoint source pollution    control plan receives federal approval    (RICHMOND) - Virginia becomes only the sixth of 33 states, commonwealths or    territories eligible to have its Coastal Nonpoint Program approved by the National    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Environmental Protection    Agency. Failure to achieve program approval could have potentially cost the    state up to $6 million per year in federal funding.    ""Controlling nonpoint source pollution is a complex issue because of its    many, diffuse sources,"" said Secretary Woodley. ""The approval of Virginia's    coastal nonpoint source program is the result of a comprehensive effort across    many fronts, with many partners involved."" The Virginia DCR is responsible    for developing and amending the nonpoint source control program.    The approval became official with today's signing of Virginia's plan in Washington,    D.C.

Virginia's coastal nonpoint source pollution, or runoff pollution, control    program covers 46 localities with tidal waters. This is roughly the entire area    east of Interstate 95. In 1998, Virginia received conditional approval of its    program, contingent on successfully addressing concerns in nine management areas    - agriculture, forestry, urban, wetlands and riparian, marinas and recreational    boating, hydromodifications, technical assistance, monitoring, and roads highways    and bridges.   Actions taken to satisfy the federal government's conditions include:       Development and implementation of the Virginia Agricultural Stewardship      Act     Establishment of the Virginia Poultry Waste Management Program     Adopting funding and tax breaks to farmers installing agricultural Best      Management Practices     Having 42 of 46 jurisdictions subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination      System (NPDES) stormwater permits     Identifying watersheds with high potential for nonpoint source pollution      and incorporating these geographic priorities into the competitive Water Quality      Improvement Fund grant process     Changing the Virginia Department of Health's Sewage Handing and Disposal      Regulations, requiring an 18"" separation between the bottom of a drainfield      and the water table      The establishment of the Virginia Clean Marina Program     The Virginia Department of Transportation's submittal of an annual stormwater      management plan to DCR     The requirement that contractors working on VDOT rights-of-way must now      have completed the DCR contractor training course     Virginia's development of nutrient reduction tributary strategies for all river    basins flowing into the Chesapeake Bay was cited as helping satisfy conditions    under several of the management areas.

The strategy also outlines a process    needed to initiate efforts to achieve greater reductions over the next decade.     The public comment draft of the Interim Nutrient Cap Strategy for the Shenandoah    and Potomac River Basins was released by Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources    John Paul Woodley, Jr. March 30, as part of Virginia's continuing commitment    to improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.   ""This strategy is an important part of a continuing process to improve    the water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and the rivers that flow into it,""    said Woodley. ""It is the next step in our quest to achieve and maintain    the water quality necessary to support the aquatic living resources of the Bay    and its tributaries."" Excess nitrogen and phosphorus rob water of oxygen    and have a negative impact on aquatic living resources and their habitat.    The goal to improve water quality is found in the new Chesapeake Bay Agreement    signed last year by Governor Gilmore and governors from Maryland and Pennsylvania,    the mayor of Washington, D.C., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator    and Virginia Senator William T. Bolling, chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission.    The agreement calls for the water quality goal to be met voluntarily by 2010    in order to avoid federal regulations.    The interim cap strategy seeks to maintain the levels of nutrient reductions    achieved through implementation the 1996 Shenandoah and Potomac Nutrient Reduction    Tributary Strategy. Maintaining these levels in the face of increased population    growth and corresponding land use changes is the strategy's main challenge.     ""We must go beyond those measures that were successful in the original    tributary strategy,"" said Woodley. ""This will mean continued improvements    in wastewater treatment facilities and increased emphasis on the control of    stormwater particularly in urban and suburban settings. It will also mean increased    efforts to let all residents of the watershed know they     have a key role in these water quality issues.""   The draft strategy lists a number of proposed actions to slow the flow of nutrients    into area waters. It also proposes developing a process to determine lines of    responsibility and to track all future nutrient flows. This tracking and accounting    system will be needed to meet future nutrient reduction goals.    The draft strategy is the result of numerous stakeholder and focus group meetings    held in the watershed over the past year. Copies of the draft have been mailed    to local governments and other interested stakeholders for review and comment.    Comments will be accepted through     June 1, 2001.    Three public information meetings will be held to review the draft and receive    comments. Meetings will be held Friday, April 27 in Colonial Beach (exact location    to be determined) at 3:30 p.m.; Tuesday, May 1 at the DEQ Northern Virginia    Regional Office, 13901 Crown Court in Woodbridge at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.; and at    the DEQ Valley Regional Office, 4411 Early Road, Harrisonburg at 2 p.m., Thursday,    May 3. Each meeting is scheduled for two hours.    The strategy can be reviewed on the Internet at either www.dcr.state.va.us    or www.deq.state.va.us.

The unique and special memories of camping can be    yours again in a Virginia State Park.   Thursday, March 1, marks the opening of the 2001 camping season in Virginia    State Parks.   ""We have camping opportunities from the mountains to the beaches of the    Chesapeake Bay,"" said Department of Conservation and Recreation Director    David Brickley. ""State park campsites are designed to ensure privacy, safety    and comfort.""   Virginia State Parks offer more than 1,000 campsites ranging from primitive    tent sites to recreational vehicle sites with electrical and water hook-ups.     ""Cabins in Virginia State Parks - a popular vacation getaway choice -    are already open,"" said State Parks Director Joe Elton. ""Spending    the night in a cabin or at a campsite is one of the most rewarding and enriching    ways to enjoy a Virginia State Park.""

If you're receiving    a state tax refund you can donate any or all of it for such use.   Designate your voluntary contribution on lines 20 and 21 of Schedule ADJ, to    accompany the Virginia Tax Return (760). If you choose the ""Open Space    Conservation and Recreation Fund,"" write in the numbers 6-8. If you choose    the ""Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund,"" write in the numbers 7-1. A    contribution to either helps preserve resources critical to the commonwealth    and to future generations.    ""Many citizens, through voluntary actions like donating private land or    participating in Adopt-A-Stream, maintaining our state parks and volunteering    in state natural areas, demonstrate an enormous stewardship ethic,"" said    David G. Brickley, director of Virginia's Department of Conservation and Recreation.    ""These voluntary contribution funds allow a quick mechanism to provide    additional support.""   And, there's an additional benefit to you: these contributions are tax-deductible.   Money designated for the Open Space fund has helped purchase state natural    areas such as Bushmill Stream (Northumberland County), North Landing River (Virginia    Beach), Poor Mountain (Roanoke) and the Pinnacle (Russell County). It has also    provided for public access and interpretive signage for the Natural Area Preserve    System. Rare species protected by fund monies include cranberry, least bittern    and pirate bush, as well as rare freshwater mussels and fish in the Clinch River.   This fund is used to acquire land for recreational purposes and as matching    grants to localities for meeting outdoor recreational needs.    Contributing to the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund has been an option for    only a couple years, yet contributions are increasing. Recently the Virginia    Department of Conservation and Recreation announced the state met a goal of    reducing nutrients in the Shenandoah-Potomac rivers, thereby lessening the nonpoint    source pollution affecting a portion of the Chesapeake Bay.   However, there are similar goals yet to be met for the James, York and Rappahannock    rivers. Monies from the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund would be used toward    those efforts.        Virginia taxpayers who aren't receiving refunds can always contribute to these    funds directly by mailing a check, payable to Treasurer of Virginia, to DCR    / 203 Governor St., Suite 302 / Richmond, Virginia 23219.   If you contribute your refund to either the Open Space Recreation and Conservation    or the Chesapeake Bay Restoration fund, you can list the amounts as itemized    deductions on your 2001 federal and state income tax forms.   If you have questions about contributing to these funds, contact the Virginia    Department of Taxation at (804) 367-8031 or online at www.tax.state.va.us. For    questions about either contribution fund, call the Virginia Department of Conservation    and Recreation at (804) 786-7961 or check the Internet at www.dcr.state.va.us.   -30-   Editors' note:  digital photos of some natural areas and species    listed in release available by contacting Lois delBueno at DCR at (804) 786-7961    or ldelbueno@dcr.state.va.us.         NEWS RELEASE (through SNR's office)   Date: January 12, 2001    Contact: Robert Beals, Special Assistant, Secretary of Natural Resources, (804)    786-0044    Gary Waugh, Department of Conservation and Recreation, (804) 786-5045    Bill Hayden, Department of Environmental Quality, (804) 698-4447   Clean Marina Program to help improve coastal    water quality    (Richmond) - Reducing nonpoint source pollution in Virginia's coastal waters    by helping marinas and recreational boaters become more environmentally sensitive    is the goal of a new, voluntary state program. Virginia Secretary of Natural    Resources John Paul Woodley, Jr. was joined by other state officials, marine    industry representatives and marina operators today as he launched the Virginia    Clean Marina Program. The launch was held at the Richmond Centre in conjunction    with the Virginia Boat Show.    The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Virginia Department    of Environmental Quality and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science have worked    with the Tidewater Marine Trades Association, the Virginia Association of Marine    Industries and others in the private sector to develop this program providing    technical assistance and a voluntary recognition program for marinas.    ""I'm pleased to announce this partnership that promotes environmental    stewardship through education and technical support,"" said Woodley. ""This    type of voluntary water quality stewardship effort incorporates Governor Gilmore's    top environmental priorities and will help ensure Virginians will always be    able to enjoy our waterways.""    As part of the new program, funded by the Virginia Coastal Program at DEQ through    a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marina Technical    and Environmental Advisory Committee has been formed. The committee, made up    of representatives from state agencies, the marine trade industry, and the recreational    boating and environmental communities, will assist the program in providing    information and technical assistance to marinas, local governments and recreational    boaters in Virginia's coastal areas. It has recently completed a Virginia Clean    Marina Guidebook that provides steps marina operators and recreational boaters    can take to protect and improve Virginia's coastal waters. The committee will    also assist in the program's marina designation process. Approximately 1,000    marinas in Virginia are eligible to vie for recognition as a ""Virginia    Clean Marina.""   Those receiving the designation will be recognized with ""Environmental    Enterprise"" status in the Virginia Environmental Excellence Program, which    offers incentives to encourage the adoption of environmental management systems    and pollution prevention efforts. They also can use the Virginia Clean Marina    logo in their correspondence and advertisements. Studies of     similar programs in other states have shown that marinas recognized as environmentally    friendly have lower vacancy rates.    Marina operators seeking designation can complete a self-assessment checklist    followed by a site visit by members of the advisory committee. Marinas not initially    meeting the minimum criteria can sign a pledge to work toward clean marina designation    within one year. The Marina Technical Assistance Program at VIMS will work with    the marina operator to meet minimum requirements.    As part of the program's launching, several marinas today pledged to work    for clean marina status. They are Ginney Point Marina in Cobbs Creek, Locklies    Marina in Topping, Port Kinsale Marina of Kinsale, Tidewater Yacht Agency, Inc.    of Portsmouth, Washington Sailing Marina in Alexandria, Wormley Creek Marina    of Yorktown and York River Yacht Haven in Gloucester Point.   ""With its focus on educating willing stewards of our resources, this new    program fits well with our continuing Virginia Naturally campaign,"" said    Woodley. ""We're already extremely pleased with the response we're receiving    from marina operators from both the public and private sector. Their input has    also been crucial to the development of the Clean Marina program.""    Virginia Naturally is a statewide initiative, launched by Governor Gilmore,    to promote lifelong learning about Virginia's environment and stewardship of    the Commonwealth's natural and historic resources.    The Virginia Clean Marina Guidebook, plus a listing of all certified Virginia    Clean Marinas and clean marina ""pledges"" will soon be available on    a website being developed for the new program. Workshops will also be made available    to marina operators from both the public and private sectors.    -30-                                                                                                                                                                DCR          Home                      State          Parks                      Soil          & Water                      Natural          Heritage                      Recreational          Planning                      Dam          Safety                                                         Last modified             7/22/03            .

The Marine Trades Association of Anne Arundel County, in partnership with Manner Resins and Giant Foods, is sponsoring four shrink wrap recycling locations within Anne Arundel County. Shrink wrap is being collected at Pasadena Boatel and Beach Club (Pasadena), Port Annapolis Marina (Annapolis), Herrington Harbour North (Tracys Landing), and one more site to be determined. Drop-offs may be made starting mid-March. For more details, contact Beth Kahr, director of the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, at 410-269-0741.  Baltimore County residents or businesses may bring their shrink wrap to Eastern Landfill on Days Cove Road in Whitemarsh or to the State Highway Administration lot on Peninsula Expressway in Dundalk between March 15 and approximately July 15.  There will be three drop-off sites in Cecil County for the first time this year. Contact Ronda Bolinger for details at 410-275-2141.  Kent County will be collecting shrink wrap at the transfer site on Nicholson Road in Chestertown. Contact Marty Holden at 410-778-7448 for more information.  There is a possibility that Talbot County will also collect shrink wrap for recycling . Details were not finalized as of press time. For information, contact James Wood at 410-758-6605. Before dropping off any shrink wrap for recycling , be sure to remove strings and doors. Consider saving the doors for reuse next winter.

How about an aggregate aboveground petroleum storage capacity greater than 1,320 gallons? O r total underground storage capacity greater than 42,000 gallons? If you answered yes to any of these questions, federal regulations (40 CFR 112) require that you take steps to prevent fuel spills, e.g ., containment dikes, oil absorbents, booms, etc. The law also requires that you describe your oil control measures in a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC ) plan. Any marina operator can draft an SPCC plan. The plan must be certified by a professional engineer, however. To alleviate the financial hardship that plan certification poses for some marinas, the Clean Marina Initiative has hired an engineering firm to review and certify SPCC plans at no cost to marinas. The firm of Purdum and Jeschke is preparing a template of an SPCC plan. Marina operators are encouraged to use the template to prepare their own plans. Then, once a marina has been authorized to proceed by the Clean Marina Office, the marina operator will contact Purdum and Jeschke to schedule a site visit and plan review. Assuming the plan is adequate, the engineer will certify the SPCC plan. To be eligible for this service, facility operators must submit a Clean Marina Pledge and a completed self-assessment. Priority will be given to facilities that meet the Clean Marina Award Criteria in all aspects except the SPCC requirement. The SPCC plan template and complete instructions will be available by the end of March on-line at www.dnr.state.md.us/ boating/cleanmarina or by calling 410-260-8770. ]  Real Marina Solutions: Lessons from Clean Marina Operators  4  Maryland Clean Marina Initiative 580 Taylor Avenue, E-2 Annapolis, MD 21401  I  NSIDE  T  HIS ISSUE...

That is, he uses the Clean Marina program as justification for enforcing marina rules intended to minimize pollution. Stated another way by Trevor Richards, general manager of Spring Cove Marina in Solomons, Clean Marina status gives us the authority to yell at customers, Hey, we are a clean marinayou cannot do that here. Mr. Richards went on to say that as more marinas practice pollution prevention, everybody s job will become easier because boaters will get used to it. Until pollution prevention becomes common place at marinas, however, staff training is essential. Take a fuel dock for example. Customers are often significantly older than the typical teenage dock hand. The dock hand needs to be coached so that he or she can confidently instruct an adult how to fuel in an environmentally-responsible manner. Victoria Shiroky, president of Magothy Marina in Severna Park, has her staff hand an oil absorbent pad to each fuel customer. The pad tells customers immediately that there is a chance of a spill and that they should use caution. At Spring Cove Marina, every diesel customer must use a plastic jug to catch vent overflow (unless they are not filling completely or the vent is inboard). Because of its flammable nature, Richards does not use catchment jugs for gasoline. He uses oil absorbent pads instead and allows the fumes to evaporate. He captures spills from vents on the far continued on page 2  1   Clean Marina Partners: Helping to Protect Marylands Waterways  The Clean Marina Partner designation was created to recognize boating facilitiesother than marinas, boatyards, and yacht clubsthat minimize their own boating-related pollution and actively promote clean boating habits. Clean Marina Partners may be public boat ramps, private community piers, Owners of charter boat liveries, or even smaller boating maritime museums. Becoming a Partner is easy. facilities are Because of the nature of their encouraged to businesses, Clean Marina Partners generally have minimal waste to participate as contain. Additionally, the Clean Clean Marina Marina Initiative can provide boater education materials, such Partners. as clean boating tip sheets and posters, at no cost. To become recognized as certified Clean Marina Partners, facility operators follow the same steps as have been established for marina operators: Obtain program materials Sign a Clean Marina Pledge Conduct a self-assessment Call upon a mentor for assistance if needed Schedule a confirmation visit Enjoy the rewards Maintain Clean Marina Partner status  Clean Marina Partners are not true marinas, yet they promote the pollution prevention goals of the Clean Marina Initiative.

Tom Gannon, general manager of Mears Yacht Haven in Oxford, urges fuel dock operators to post fueling rules on large signs right at the dock. Such signs help to give credibility to young dock hands as they ask experienced boaters to follow strict fueling rules. There are opportunities to minimize pollution away from the fuel dock, as well. Tom Wilhelm, owner of Ferry Point Marina in Arnold, insists that all work be conducted over filter fabric tarps. Another option is to capture maintenance debris with vacuum sanders. Pollution prevention can be financially rewarding . Dave Gohsman, former general manager of Port Annapolis Marina, made money on tarp sales and the rental of vacuum sanders to do-it-yourself customers. He also saved money on trash pickups by recycling solid waste such as plastic shrink wrap, aluminum cans, and glass bottles. Mark Mattiucci, owner of Point Lookout Marina in Ridge, sells recovered zinc anodes to a scrap dealer. Positive publicity is another advantage of Clean Marina certification. The Clean Marina Initiative displays an exhibit at boat shows and runs advertisements in boating publications encouraging boaters to patronize certified Clean Marinas. A potential customer visited Brandt Rodey, manager of Shipwright Harbor in Deale, after checking the list of certified Clean Marinas on DNRs web site ( w w w.dnr.state.md.us/boating/ cleanmarina). There are also less tangible benefits associated with Clean Marina status. For example, Mr. Mattiuccis customers are impressed with the positive changes in the appearance of Point Lookout Marina brought about, in part, by his pursuit of Clean Marina status. His customers also feel more confident about repair work because the general orderliness of the yard conveys a sense of efficiency. ]  Certified Clean Marina Partners  Coltons Point, Fishing Creek Landings, and Zanhisers Certified! To date, 26 boating facilities have met the rigorous pollution prevention standards established by the Clean Marina Initiative. The latest marinas to join this list of elite facilities are Coltons Point Marina (Coltons Point), F ishing Creek Landings Marina (Chesapeake Beach), and Zanhiser s Yachting Center (Solomons). To minimize the chance of a fuel spill at Coltons Point Marina, the owners have installed double -walled aboveground fuel tanks equipped with emergency shut-off valves at the tanks, fuel dock, and in the office. To prevent even small spills, manager Clark Lutz Pam Sisson, Fishing Creek keeps a specially-designed plastic jug Landings Marina, (top) and at the fuel dock to catch overflows from Coltons Point Marina vessel vent fittings. And if there is ever owners and manager a fuel spill at Coltons Point Marina or accept their awards. any neighboring facility, Lutz is ready: he maintains a roomful of response equipment including booms and oil absorbent pads. We have been working toward Clean Marina certification since we have had new owners: about two years, said Mr. Lutz. For example, in the past we didnt give a second thought to how we pressure washed boats.

Dave and Pam Sisson, owners of Fishing Creek Landings Marina, control pollution from all areas of the marina, including the fuel dock. Their staff routinely place a square of oil absorbent material around the fuel nozzle before handing the hose to customers. The pad catches any fuel that backs up in the fill pipe. Most of our customers enjoy fishing , said Dave Sisson. By making improvements to the marina, we are protecting the habitat that supports the fish and crabs. Environmental protection is good for our business and for the Chesapeake Bay. Zahnisers Yachting Center is a full-service boatyard that offers the amenities of a fine resort. Manager Jim Sharkey insists that negative environmental consequences from all aspects of marina operations be minimized. For example, workers use high-volume low-pressure spray guns. Environmental protection also has a fun side at Zahnisers. Patrons are invited to adopt an oyster. In exchange for a $2 donation which is forwarded to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), they are given a birth certificate, a paper oyster to color, and information about the important role oysters play in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The colored oysters are prominently displayed in the marina store.

Bob Vargo & Anne Coburn-Griffis Northwest Scenic River District                               Dam removal benefits  Olentangy Scenic River                    Restoring the Olentangy State Scenic River to the natural  free-flowing stream it once was is an important goal. This past fall, the Ohio Scenic Rivers Program took its first step toward realizing that goal by removing the Dennison Dam.                                     Volunteers plant 2,600 trees along Kokosing Scenic River                      Despite bitter wind and damp conditions, a small group of volunteers from Knox County and the division planted more than 2,600 trees along the Kokosing State Scenic River in early April.       Because of volunteer efforts, a Knox County-owned wellfield, located in Howard outside of Mt. Vernon, will grow into a well-forested buffer for the Kokosing. Volunteers also planted trees along an eroded bank of the river.       About 10 volunteers planted a variety of trees including swamp white oak, black cherry, green ash, sycamore, pin oak and other hardwood trees. As the trees mature, they will help stabilize the streambank, provide habitat and shade for the Kokosing, as well as filter water before entering the river and the groundwater supply of the wellfield.                                      Dennison Dam was located south of the city of Delaware, off State Route 315. Removing        it re-established a series of riffle, run and pool habitats, which had been hidden below the slow-moving slack water of the impoundment.       Increasing the number of habitat types will allow a greater diversity of fish, insects and other aquatic organisms to colonize the area.        The removal eliminated the barrier that blocked fish and other aquatic organisms from freely migrating up and down the river.       As the water receded behind the dam, a pleasant surprise emerged. At the far reach of the impoundment a small waterfall appeared. The waterfall, hidden under the impounded waters for nearly 100 years, is a new feature of the scenic Olentangy River.       Other benefits of the dam’s removal include higher levels of dissolved oxygen and greater access to adjacent floodplains. As a recreational bonus, the area will be more appealing to pad.                              dlers because the dangerous hazard of portaging around the former dam has been eliminated.       The removal of Dennison Dam was supported by Ohio’s Scenic Rivers Protection fund. The work was performed by corpsmembers from the Ohio Civilian Conservation Corps.       The Ohio Scenic Rivers Program hopes to coordinate the removal of other lowhead dams along the Olentangy State Scenic River, as well as other Ohio state scenic rivers.        Scenic Rivers staff continue to work with dam owners, residents and local organizations to garner support and permission for future dam removals.

And further west, two boat loads of anglers  had luck and the U.S. Coast Guard on their side when their boats  capsized or sank.      ""This is a risky time of  year for boaters,"" said Paul Donheffner, director of the  Oregon State Marine Board. ""People want to get out on the  water, but conditions can be dangerous. This last week is a reminder  for people to be extremely cautious and make sure they are fully  prepared if the worst happens.""      The first accident occurred Friday,  May 19, 38 miles off shore of Newport within site of some 80 recreational  boats fishing for halibut. A 26 foot fishing boat began taking  on water, forcing the four occupants to quickly don life jackets  and abandon ship as it literally sank beneath them. According  to Coast Guard reports, three climbed onto another fishing boat.  The fourth person jumped in the water and was picked up by a 44  foot Coast Guard vessel.      Another accident occurred Sunday,  May 28, when a 22 foot fishing boat with six people aboard capsized  while attempting to cross the Rogue River Bar. The bar was closed  to vessels 21 feet and under, according to U.S. Coast Guard reports.  Coast Guard personnel witnessed the capsizing and immediately  deployed a rescue boat and called in a Coast Guard helicopter,  which happened to be about one minute from the scene. An 11 year-old  youth was the only person aboard wearing a life jacket.      Though no one died in the accident,  the outcome could have been different had a helicopter not been  in the vicinity and a rescue boat quickly deployed. ""In the  ocean, life jackets buy you critical time,"" said Donheffner.  ""Hypothermia sets in quickly, making it hard to rescue yourself.  We’ve had several potentially serious accidents this spring  where youths have been wearing their life jackets and it probably  made the difference. Adults should take a lesson and wear them  as well."" Under Oregon law, all youths 12 and younger must  wear an appropriately sized life vest when in a boat underway.      East of the Cascades, a rafter  died Monday, May 29, while rafting down the Klamath River Canyon.  The victim was part of a guided rafting trip and was wearing safety  equipment when his raft overturned. According to press reports,  he had a life vest, helmet and wet suit, but was probably overwhelmed  by strong current and class-five rapids.      At about the same time on Monday,  a family overturned their raft on a swift stretch of the lower  Imnaha River in Wallowa County. An eight-year old girl, who was  wearing a life jacket, became entangled in the raft and drowned  before being rescued.      ""Many things combine to create  these tragedies,"" said Donheffner. ""The remote location,  low water temperature, high river flows, weather, the boat operator’s  skills – all of that comes in to play. Know your skills,  wear your life jacket and be prepared. It won’t prevent every  tragedy, but it will greatly increase your odds of survival.""      The two latest fatalities brings  the total number for Oregon this year to three. The first fatality  of the year occurred on the Columbia River near Umatilla when  a barge apparently destroyed a recreational boat at anchor at  night. In 1999, 16 boating related fatalities were reported. Of  the 16, 14 were not wearing life jackets."

This is considered best for fine maple candy.       Medium Amber  has a little more maple flavor and is made about mid-season.       Dark Amber , although slightly darker and with a stronger maple flavor, is fast     becoming a favored table syrup.                        Maple Facts            The sugar maple and black maple are the most common trees tapped to produce maple     syrup. A tree should be from 30 to 40 years old before tapping and more than 10 inches in     diameter.       As a rule of thumb, a tree can give as much as a gallon of sap for each tap it has per     day.       Maple sap is a colorless liquid with a light, sweet taste. Through boiling, the maple     taste and amber color are formed. It takes between 30 to 40 gallons of sap to make one     gallon of syrup."

He incorporates this history while providing camel-trekking trips for visitors through both Big Bend Ranch State Park and the Monahans Sandhills State Park…          ""This behemoth, a 2050 pound 8 foot tall camel is a two-hump variety.  He is a bactrian camel. They are found in Central and Northern Asia…in contrast to the more common one hump, or Arabian camel of the Sahara.""      These half-day, overnight, and three-day treks for up to 6 persons travel the same Big Bend region of West Texas that the historic U.S. Camel Corps explored in 1859 and 1860.

E Volunteer Infantry re-enacts life for the Civil War soldiers and civilians with divided loyalties.         Through living history, the re-enactors will demonstrate military life with military camps of Union   and Confederate soldiers. Muleshoe Bend, the small town caught in the middle of the conflict, will showcase civilian life caught in the bloody conflict and explain the medical practices common in the era.         The Friends of Holly Recreation Area will be selling coffee, donuts and cold soft drinks to raise funds for future special events and improvements at the park.         Visitors are welcome to observe and learn more about life during the Civil War. Cost is limited to a Motor Vehicle Permit to enter the park, $4 for a daily pass and $20 for an annual pass.         Schedule of Events    Saturday, May 17    7:00 a.m.            Reveille in military camps    8:30 a.m.            Confederate Company Drill on battlefield    9:30 a.m.            Federal Company Drill on battlefield    11:00 a.m.         Ladies of Muleshoe Bend prepare medical supplies at the Seamstress Shop    12:30 p.m.           Street Bazaar in Muleshoe Bend    1:00 p.m.            Traveling Medicine Show wagon    2:00 p.m.            Liberation of Muleshoe Bend by Federals    3:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield    4:00 p.m.            Baking Contest judging at Sheriff’s Office    5:00 p.m.              Box Social in Town Square    8:00 p.m.            Field Hospital Demonstration         Sunday, May 18    10:00 a.m.           Period   Church   Service    12:30 p.m.          Civilian Social at the Seamstress Shop    2:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield                                                                                             Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                August Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Free Fishing Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Wetzel State Park Clean-up                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State Park                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                RESCHEDULED:  MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland's Tulip Time Festival                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Bay City Recreation Area Run by The Bay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                July Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Fort Wilkins State Park's Memorial Day Ceremony                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Porcupine Wilderness State Park's Bird of Prey Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                June Events at DNR State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland State Park Snowbird Festival                                                                                                                                            Michigan.gov Home    |    DNR Home    |    Report All Poaching 1-800-292-7800    |    Feedback    |    Site Map    |    Contact DNR    |    Ask DNR Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

The New York State Thruway offers an almost parallel driving             route to the Erie Canal, and offers easy access to numerous Canal             attractions and boat launches.  The Oswego Canal can be reached             via the Thruway by taking Exit 34.  Follow signs for Route 481             North toward Oswego; the Cayuga-Seneca Canal can also be reached via             the Thruway; by taking either Exit 41 or 42 toward the Finger Lakes             Region and the Cayuga-Seneca Canal.  To visit the Champlain Canal, take the             Adirondack Northway-Interstate 87N and numerous smaller roads will             connect you. For more specific driving directions, please consult a             New York State map.               Cruising by boat?               All four Canals are easily accessible by boat. If coming from the             south, cruising up the Hudson River will bring boaters to the             eastern entrance of the Erie Canal in Waterford. If continuing             north, boaters will then enter the Champlain Canal.  Traveling from             east to west on the Erie Canal, boaters can also gain access to the             Great Lakes by connecting with the Oswego Canal to enter Lake             Ontario or continuing west to the end of the Erie Canal, where by             traversing the Federal Black Rock Lock, one can enter Lake Erie. The             Cayuga-Seneca Canal also connects with the Erie Canal in the central             part of New York, allowing boaters to visit the Finger Lakes region             as well.               The New York State Canal System is part of the Intracoastal             Waterway that runs along the Eastern U.S. seaboard. For more             information about the Intracoastal Waterway, please consult your             nearest marine center for charts or the National Ocean Service, NOAA             in Riverdale, MD., 315-436-6990.               Come and enjoy the beauty and history of the New York State Canal             System. Come cruise the past and unlock the adventure!

This was a good decision because every mural is unique and should be designed to fit into, and be a part of,   it's own architectural space.  While the mural at Audrey Moore is in a large open space, the mural at Providence will be painted in a space that is narrower and tighter.  At Audrey Moore, the objective was to create a fantasyas if the patrons were stepping into another world.  But at Providence, the intention is to add color to the foyer...to create a decorative compliment to the architectural space.     The new mural was designed to integrate with the unusual architectural environment at Providence Recreation Center. The design emphasizes the diagonal lines and the triangular space found in the architecture.  The overall composition frames the space into three groupings or vignettes that  move vertically toward the apex.  Diagonal lines add to the direction and movement of the composition.  This compositional device was used by Matisse in his famous ""Barnes Foundation"" murals.      Within the groupings, are curvi-linear shapes that bend and stretch in gestures that are loosely reminiscent of the activities practiced at the recreation center.  For this mural, we (the managers at Providence and the artists) decided that the emphasis should be on the activity, as opposed to the person, engaged in the activity.  In other words, we asked ourselves the age-old question, ""How do you separate the dance from the dancer?""  We wanted the focus to be on swimming, diving, gymnastics, pilates etcwithout the anatomy, hair color, facial expressions etc., interfering with the pleasure of observing just the movements.  In order to keep that focus, we decided to go with a more abstract or stylized means of representation.      The goal of the painting is not to illustrate people but to capture movements and rhythms.  Someone might ask, ""Why is it an either/or situation? Why not fully illustrate the human body and capture the figures' explosive movement?""  There are two answers to that:  First; inevitably when you focus on realistically rendered anatomy and invest a lot of attention to that kind of detail, then that takes over the viewers attention and becomes the subject.  Second; for this particular architectural space, the managers and the artists felt that a realistic style would be too over-powering.  In this case, a more decorative and abstract style would be more suitable because it compliments the architecture and emphasizes the more intangible qualities of athleticism: movement, rhythm, gracefulness and strength.                                                SEARCH:     Home  |  Business  |  Visiting  |  Government  |  eServices  |  Contact       Web Privacy Policy           The page address is:  fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/rec/prov/prov-newmural.htm  Last Modified:   Friday, October 24, 2003                                                     © FAIRFAX  COUNTY  PARK  AUTHORITY   [  12055 Government Center Pkwy.

GX241-91-12620568	HR15.html     03 LC 18 2169    House Resolution 15 By: Representatives Day of the 126 th , Jackson of the 124 th , Post 1, Stephens of the 123 rd , Purcell of the 122 nd , Keen of the 146 th  and others    A RESOLUTION     Commending the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Association; and for other purposes. WHEREAS, in 1938, the U.S. Congress passed a Rivers & Harbors Act which authorized a 12 foot depth in the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Association allowing the use of larger vessels by contract, common or private carriers, and offered a reduction of hazard to life and vessels for pleasure craft and recreational boaters; and WHEREAS, it is the mission of the association to encourage the continuation and further development of waterborne commerce and recreation in the Intracoastal Waterways of VA, NC, SC, GA, and FL through the promotion of adequate dredging, safe navigation, and maintenance; and WHEREAS, millions of tons of cargo, goods, and services are transported on the waterway each year offering an efficient and competitive alternate mode of transportation; and WHEREAS, in addition to commerce, the association provides boaters, vacationers, and outdoor enthusiasts with recreational, tourism, and eco-tourism opportunities; and WHEREAS, these association activities also provide opportunities for countless ancillary businesses to support both commercial transportation and recreational boating; and WHEREAS, all of these association activities and their associated economies provide the State of Georgia and the nation with direct and indirect revenues through ad valorem taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, license fees, and insurance fees; and WHEREAS, while deferred maintenance and dredging activities have resulted in less than authorized depth conditions, the waterway today remains a fundamental segment of the State of Georgia ´ s and the nation ´ s transportation infrastructure system; and WHEREAS, it is abundantly fitting and proper that the outstanding efforts of this association be recognized appropriately. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES that the members of this body commend the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Association for their energetic and creative response to the continuing needs of the intracoastal waterways of this state. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Clerk of the House of Representatives is authorized and directed to transmit a copy of this Resolution to Rosemary Lynch, Executive Director of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Association.        

These state resource properties contain nearly 40,000 acres of rugged, forested knobs in Clark, Scott, and Washington counties. Two loop trails, one six miles and the other eight miles, have been developed at the northern end of the Knobstone Trail. Eight trailheads  GENERAL INFORMATION 23 provide parking and access to the trail. Backpack camping is permitted in the two Backcountry Areas the trail crosses, as well as along the rest of the trail within certain guidelines. Campgrounds are available near each end of the trail.

Washington Street W271 Indianapolis, Indiana 46204-2782 317-232-4070 www.IN.gov/dnr/outdoor  G  YPSY  M  OTH  ALERT  T  The gypsy moth is a destructive insect pest of hardwood forests and urban landscapes in the United States. There are four developmental life stages of gypsy moth: the egg, larva, pupa and adult. The larva of this insect, called a caterpillar, eats the foliage of approximately 500 host plants, but prefers oak, apple, willow and, to a lesser extent, hickory and maple. The larvae are only present in the spring and though they produce silk, they do not build tents. Gypsy moths are not native to the United States. They were accidentally introduced from Europe to Medford, Massachusetts in 1869 and have spread steadily westward. Natural spread occurs when caterpillars spin a silken strand and are windblown out of infested areas. Gypsy moths are spread long distances when people, unknowingly, carry life stages from infested areas to non-infested areas. Indiana is detecting large numbers of moths and isolated infestation in northern Indiana. You can help prevent the spread of gypsy moth. Learn to identify gypsy moth life stages if found. For information visit our website. Quarantined counties listed as of December 2001 include: Allen, Dekalb, Elkhart, LaGrange, Noble, Porter and Steuben. It is important to check campers, trailers, and vehicles for gypsy moth life stages from May through August, especially if you are planning to visit another state park or property, outside the quarantined areas.  ICK TIPS Several different kinds of ticks live in Indiana. Only a few are of special concern because of the diseases they may transmit. In order to reduce your exposure to tick bites use these simple tips: 1) Wear light-colored, long-sleeved shirts or blouses and trousers when hiking in areas with suspected tick populations. 2) Tuck the pant legs of your trousers into your socks. 3) Use approved tick repellents on your clothing. Always follow label directions for any repellent you select. 4) Check your outer clothing and scalp as well as the clothing and scalps of those with you for ticks prior to entering your vehicle or entering your home after a hike. Be sure to check pets for ticks before letting your pet into a house or car. 5) Remove attached ticks when they are discovered by firmly grabbing the tick's head as close to the skin as possible with a pair of tweezers or with your fingers covered by a tissue. Pull the tick straight backwards, without bending or twisting the tick's body. Never apply flammable products or other household chemicals to an attached tick. Seek medical assistance if necessary. 6) Record the date of a tick bite on a calendar. If you develop fevers, rashes, or flulike symptoms contact your family physician and inform them of the tick bite. Schedule an appointment.  7) On many state properties your property manager or a naturalist may be able to advise you of any sections of a property with especially strong tick populations. If you keep these tips in mind, they will help you to enjoy Indiana's outdoor resources more safely.  DIVISION OF ENTOMOLOGY & PLANT PATHOLOGY Indiana Department of Natural Resources 402 W.

Preserving Native American, Agricultural and Environmental Heritage! Located along Interstate 65, just four miles from Greater Lafayette, Indiana, The Museums At Prophetstown will provide the opportunity for future generations to participate in making the past come alive. Although the Museums At Prophetstown is under construction, a number of special tours and events are planned during 2002. The Threshing Event takes place at the Living History Farm in July, and self-guided walking tours through the Prairie are availabe during the summer. accommodate varying needs. More than 200 acres of Museums At Prophetstown have been restored to the grassland, wetland and timber that was once so common to Tippecanoe County. The prairie restoration is in its fourth year and the diversity of both grasses and forbes is impressive. In 1808 the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa built a village, called Prophetstown, near this place. The village was destroyed by William Henry Harrison in a conflict known as the Battle of Tippecanoe. The Museums At Prophetstown is reconstructing an early 1800 s woodland village. Visitors will find several lodges in the village including a 40 x 60 council house and traditional wigwams. The Gibson Farmhouse is a replica of a 1918 Sears & Roebuck catalog house. Completed in the fall of 2000, the site continues to grow as outbuildings are added. Although not open to the public daily, the Wabash Valley Farm hosts numerous special events, such as corn husking, that transports visitors back to farm life in the 1920s.

Year-round camping, fishing, picnicking, boating and wildlife viewing opportunities make Fool Hollow Lake Recreation Area a very popular place. This 800-acre, cool, country recreation area with a 150-acre lake offers history, too.       The tiny town of Adair has long since been covered by the lake, but it was Thomas Westly Adair who was responsible for the name Fool Hollow. In 1885, Adair moved into the area with the intention of farming. The locals joked that only a fool would try and farm the place. The name stuck!        This state of the art recreation area, located in the Apache - Sitgreaves National Forest, opened in 1994 as a result of an innovative partnership between Arizona State Parks, the U.S. Forest Service, Arizona Game and Fish, the City of Show Low, and corporate sponsors Arizona Public Service and McCarty Construction Company.                         Fishing        Show Low Creek flows into Fool Hollow Lake, providing a natural feeding ground for a variety of wildlife and a very diverse fishery.        Fishing opportunities are abundant with rainbow trout, brown trout, large and small mouth bass, black crappie, green sunfish, channel catfish and walleye are all present in the lake. Catchable sized rainbow trout are stocked by the Arizona Game and Fish Department mid-May through September.

Cost is limited to a Motor Vehicle Permit to enter the park, $4 for a daily pass and $20 for an annual pass.         Schedule of Events    Saturday, May 17    7:00 a.m.            Reveille in military camps    8:30 a.m.            Confederate Company Drill on battlefield    9:30 a.m.            Federal Company Drill on battlefield    11:00 a.m.         Ladies of Muleshoe Bend prepare medical supplies at the Seamstress Shop    12:30 p.m.           Street Bazaar in Muleshoe Bend    1:00 p.m.            Traveling Medicine Show wagon    2:00 p.m.            Liberation of Muleshoe Bend by Federals    3:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield    4:00 p.m.            Baking Contest judging at Sheriff’s Office    5:00 p.m.              Box Social in Town Square    8:00 p.m.            Field Hospital Demonstration         Sunday, May 18    10:00 a.m.           Period   Church   Service    12:30 p.m.          Civilian Social at the Seamstress Shop    2:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield                                                                                             Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                August Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Free Fishing Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Wetzel State Park Clean-up                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State Park                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                RESCHEDULED:  MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland's Tulip Time Festival                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Bay City Recreation Area Run by The Bay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                July Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Fort Wilkins State Park's Memorial Day Ceremony                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Porcupine Wilderness State Park's Bird of Prey Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                June Events at DNR State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland State Park Snowbird Festival                                                                                                                                            Michigan.gov Home    |    DNR Home    |    Report All Poaching 1-800-292-7800    |    Feedback    |    Site Map    |    Contact DNR    |    Ask DNR Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

Cost is limited to a Motor Vehicle Permit to enter the park, $4 for a daily pass and $20 for an annual pass.         Schedule of Events    Saturday, May 17    7:00 a.m.            Reveille in military camps    8:30 a.m.            Confederate Company Drill on battlefield    9:30 a.m.            Federal Company Drill on battlefield    11:00 a.m.         Ladies of Muleshoe Bend prepare medical supplies at the Seamstress Shop    12:30 p.m.           Street Bazaar in Muleshoe Bend    1:00 p.m.            Traveling Medicine Show wagon    2:00 p.m.            Liberation of Muleshoe Bend by Federals    3:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield    4:00 p.m.            Baking Contest judging at Sheriff’s Office    5:00 p.m.              Box Social in Town Square    8:00 p.m.            Field Hospital Demonstration         Sunday, May 18    10:00 a.m.           Period   Church   Service    12:30 p.m.          Civilian Social at the Seamstress Shop    2:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield                                                                                             Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                August Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Free Fishing Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Wetzel State Park Clean-up                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State Park                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                RESCHEDULED:  MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland's Tulip Time Festival                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Bay City Recreation Area Run by The Bay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                July Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Fort Wilkins State Park's Memorial Day Ceremony                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Porcupine Wilderness State Park's Bird of Prey Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                June Events at DNR State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland State Park Snowbird Festival                                                                                                                                            Michigan.gov Home    |    DNR Home    |    Report All Poaching 1-800-292-7800    |    Feedback    |    Site Map    |    Contact DNR    |    Ask DNR Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

The climax of      the episode took place in 1915, when the peak blew an enormous mushroom cloud some seven miles into the stratosphere.      The reawakening of this volcano, which began as a vent on a larger extinct volcano known as Tehama, profoundly altered      the surrounding landscape.       -- From: U.S. National Park Service Website, Geology Fieldnotes -  Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, April 2000              Volcanic Highlights and Features         -- ""America's Volcanic Past""     Lassen Peak Lava Dome ...

Lassen Peak     began erupting in 1914 ,   had the most significant activity in 1915, and had minor activity until 1921.     Lassen Volcanic National Park  is located fifty miles east of Red Bluff on highway 36, and 50 miles east of Redding on highway 44. The park is open year-round, however, access is difficult in winter and spring. The best time of the year to visit the park for hiking and car touring is August and September.   Allow at least three hours to drive across the park and to make stops. The best time of the year to visit for cross country skiing  and snowshoeing is January, February and March.     Snow covers much of the park  mid October through early June.  The  Lassen Park Road  (the main road that connects Highway 89) is usually  closed late October through early June.   Many of the main park attractions are snow covered and   inaccessible by car and foot. July, August, and September may bring mostly sunny skies with warm daytime  temperatures and cold nighttime temperatures.

Allow four hours for the round trip, though some take more time, some less.  For a pleasant hike:         Wear low-heeled, sturdy shoes.      Hike at a moderate pace, and take short, frequent rests.  Enjoy the ever-changing view!      Take a lunch along. (Bring water)      Dark glasses, sunburn lotion, a hat, and jacket are advisable.      Do not start later than two hours before sunset, or when bad weather threatens.  Lightning frequently strikes the summit.       DO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS ACROSS THE TRAIL.   It is prohibited because: a) It is dangerous.  Strained muscles or broken bones can result. b) Dislodged rocks are dangerous to hikers below. c) It can cause landslides which destroy lower sections of trails.  Remember, your tax dollars rebuild trails destroyed by shortcutting.           -- Excerpt from: Paul E.

Cost is limited to a Motor Vehicle Permit to enter the park, $4 for a daily pass and $20 for an annual pass.         Schedule of Events    Saturday, May 17    7:00 a.m.            Reveille in military camps    8:30 a.m.            Confederate Company Drill on battlefield    9:30 a.m.            Federal Company Drill on battlefield    11:00 a.m.         Ladies of Muleshoe Bend prepare medical supplies at the Seamstress Shop    12:30 p.m.           Street Bazaar in Muleshoe Bend    1:00 p.m.            Traveling Medicine Show wagon    2:00 p.m.            Liberation of Muleshoe Bend by Federals    3:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield    4:00 p.m.            Baking Contest judging at Sheriff’s Office    5:00 p.m.              Box Social in Town Square    8:00 p.m.            Field Hospital Demonstration         Sunday, May 18    10:00 a.m.           Period   Church   Service    12:30 p.m.          Civilian Social at the Seamstress Shop    2:00 p.m.            Battle on the Battlefield                                                                                             Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                August Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Free Fishing Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Wetzel State Park Clean-up                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State Park                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                RESCHEDULED:  MSU Women's Crew Races at Sleepy Hollow State  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland's Tulip Time Festival                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Bay City Recreation Area Run by The Bay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                July Events at Michigan's State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Fort Wilkins State Park's Memorial Day Ceremony                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Porcupine Wilderness State Park's Bird of Prey Weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                June Events at DNR State Parks                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Holland State Park Snowbird Festival                                                                                                                                            Michigan.gov Home    |    DNR Home    |    Report All Poaching 1-800-292-7800    |    Feedback    |    Site Map    |    Contact DNR    |    Ask DNR Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

We  are still getting cool nights and somewhat warm Indian Summer days and this is  helping to keep the leaves on the trees, but the golden yellows are quickly  beginning to turn to brown, and in many areas more color is on the ground than  in the trees. The area has some rain and light wind and it is beginning to take  its toll. If you want to see the fall colors in all their beauty this year, I  recommend you do it this week.    Please, dont forget, when the leaves start covering the forest floor they  are quickly dried by the wind and the danger of forest fires rises. Be extra  careful in these conditions so we can enjoy the color again next year. Another  thing to keep in mind if you are visiting the Wayne National Forest is that last  winter we had a major ice storm that broke the tops of thousands of trees and  pushed others all the way over. This debris left on the forest floor adds to the  hazardous fuel that could make a forest fire burn faster and hotter. Please, be  extra careful! The ice storm also left many large branches hanging in the  treetops that could blow down on you. Be sure to look up and know what is above  you. We want you back next year!

Each of the links below provide a recommended driving tour for viewing fall  colors on the forest.      Athens Unit   Ironton Unit   Marietta Unit     Why Leaves Change Color.    Most people suppose fall frosts are responsible for the color change in trees, but this is not the case. Many years the leaves change colors long before we have a frost.    According to Indian legend, celestial hunters slew the Great Bear in the autumn, and his blood, dripping on the forests, changed many leaves to red. Other trees were turned yellow by the fat that splattered out of the kettle as the hunters cooked the meat.    We now know that trees change color as a result of chemical processes. All during spring and summer a green pigment in the leaves, called chlorophyll, absorbs energy from the sunlight and uses it to transform carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates. Along with the green pigment, the leaves also contain yellow and orange pigments. Most of the year these pigments are masked by the greater amount of green chlorophyll. But in the fall, partly because of changes in the period of daylight and changes in temperature, the green pigment breaks down; the green color fades; and the yellowish colors become visible.    At the same time, other chemical changes occur causing the formation of additional pigments that vary from yellow to red to blue. These pigments are responsible for the reddish and purplish fall colors of leaves, such as dogwoods and sumacs. Others give the sugar maple its brilliant orange or fiery red and yellow. The various colors result from different amounts of the pigments in various tree species during the fall season.     Fall weather conditions favoring the formation of brilliant red colors are warm, sunny days with cool nights of temperatures below 45 degrees. Sugars are made in the leaves during the daytime, but cool nights prevent the sugars from moving from the leaves. The red pigment is formed from the trapped sugars. The degree of color may vary from tree to tree. Leaves directly exposed to the sun may turn red, while those on the shady side of the same tree, or on other trees, may be yellow. Depending on weather conditions, the colors on one tree can vary from year to year.   Color changes are not the only changes taking place in the leaves in Fall.  A layer of cells are laid down at the base of the leaf stalk to gradually sever the leaf.  The layer also acts as a healing scar once the leaf drops.  The oaks and a few other species may keep their dead leaves until growth starts in the spring.   The leaves still provide a function to nature even after they've fallen.  Leaves contain relatively large amounts of valuable elements, which when decomposed return to the soil.

Hikers may once again explore trails that lead to the sapphire lakes, pinnacle  studded ridges and flowered mountain slopes of the Mount Margaret Backcountry.  Visitors to this rugged and spectacular portion of the Monument can see effects  of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The lateral blast, a hot stone filled  wind, shattered trees and swirled around peaks and basins as it toppled thousands  of acres of pristine forest.   Trails in the Mount Margaret Backcountry have narrow tread, are steep in places  and can climb over 2,000 feet in elevation. Some trails are very challenging.  The Whittier Trail #214, in particular, is very narrow and crosses steep cliffs,  it is not suitable for hikers that are uncomfortable with heights.    Portions of trails are often covered by snow until midsummer. Be prepared to  cross snow slopes if you plan an early season visit.   Eight backcountry camps can accommodate tent campers.   To protect natural features, pets and pack stock are prohibited in the Mount  Margaret Backcountry. Fires are not allowed, plan to use a camp stove for cooking.   P ermits & Fees      All campers in the Mount Margaret Backcountry must carry a valid    Northwest Forest Pass  and camping permit.

Water is available from small springs north  of the Boundary Trail.   Shovel, Snow, Obscurity and Panhandle Camps are all located along the    Lakes Trail #211 , beside tranquil mountain lakes. These lakes are at elevations  between 4,300 feet and 4,700 feet. In early summer, snow is usually present and  the surfaces of the lakes may be partially frozen. At these camps, water is available  from lakes and streams. These lakes support Eastern Brook Trout.   All campsites may be snow covered in early summer, if you plan an early season  trip be prepared to camp on snow.
