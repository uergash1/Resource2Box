GX026-54-15678861	"Attorney          General Files Lawsuit Against Illegal Pyramid Promoters in Tri-Cities         Pasco  -March 1, 2000- Washington Attorney General          Christine Gregoire today filed a lawsuit against 13 promoters of Renewal          Celebration, a large-scale illegal pyramid scheme operating out of the          Tri-Cities.          The lawsuit stems from a Renewal Celebration meeting          in Kennewick last September. Plain clothes police officers estimate as          many as 1,800 people attended and as much as $2.1 million was put in circulation          during the evening. The officers broke up the meeting and with court authorization          seized various records and about $50,000.          Pyramid schemes are an old consumer fraud and have          been reappearing recently in Washington State.          ""Pyramid schemes are illegal,"" Gregoire          said. ""People are enticed to join in with the promise they will get          more cash back than they contribute, but the reality is, the vast majority          of the people involved lose everything they invest.""          Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller endorsed the          filing of the lawsuit stating, ""Even after money and records were          seized from the committee, they simply moved their illegal scheme outside          Benton County. The Attorney Generals action is exactly the step needed          to attack this problem on a statewide basis.""          Gregoire praised the efforts of Benton County law          enforcement officials in investigating the Renewal Celebration. She said          the lawsuit is a cooperative effort between her office, the Benton County          Prosecutors Office, and the Kennewick and Richland police departments.                    Kennewick and Richland detectives conducted an extensive          investigation and attorneys from Gregoires office prepared the lawsuit,          which alleges violations of the Consumer Protection Act and Chain Distributor          Schemes Act.          Gregoire said the 13 defendants formed a committee          to promote illegal pyramid games under the guise of ""gifting""          programs. Since pyramid schemes are illegal, many operators today are          labeling them as gifting groups or clubs, often with family, church or          self-help themes. The defendants have previously used the names ""Northwest          Gifting,"" ""Friends and Family,"" ""Northwest Family,""          and ""Jubilee Celebration.""          ""These 13 individuals have cloaked their scheme          in feel-good words like gifting and renewal celebrations, but it is nothing          more than an age-old scam that separates a lot of people from their money,""          Gregoire said.          The lawsuit seeks to stop the defendants from operating          pyramid schemes, pay restitution to those who lost money, pay civil penalties          of up to $2,000 per violation and reimburse the state for legal fees.          The states lawsuit contends the defendants invited          people to attend the Renewal Celebration and participate in ""boards""          or ""reports."" In a typical board, eight individuals would be          recruited to join seven existing members in a 15-member board. The board          is registered by event organizers in a pyramid configuration, with the          eight new recruits at the bottom, four members above them, two more at          the next level, and a single person at the head of the board.            The eight new recruits would each pay $2,000 to the          person at the head of the board. The top person then moves off the board          with $16,000 cash. The board is then split in half, with the two people          who were on the second tier now moving to the top of the new pyramids.          The two new boards now must recruit eight new members, so it takes 16          people to pay off the top two people.                  Organizers also ran seven-member pyramids which required          an investment of $6,000 and pay $24,000.         Gregoire said people who get in first are usually the only ones who make          money because the deeper you go into a pyramid, the harder it is to find          new participants.          ""The 13 defendants we have sued today are perpetuating a fraud,""          Gregoire said. ""They have given it a new name, but its the same          old game, and despite the rosy promises, only a few people here will walk          away winners. The vast majority will lose everything.""          Members of the committee falsely claimed that the          payoffs were tax free because the IRS code permits gifts of up to $10,000          a year without tax liability. They also falsely implied the Attorney Generals          Office ruled the program was legal.          Gregoire said her office is beginning to hear stories          of pyramids collapsing around the state. There are stories of fist-fights          and people who could ill-afford losing money realizing they have lost          everything. ""Pyramids are especially insidious because in the end,          people are likely to victimize their friends and loved ones,"" she          said. ""They divide families and they splinter our communities.""                             -30-                       Index"

Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. How do Pyramids Work? Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot. Why do Pyramids Fail? Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality, however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money. How is a Typical Pyramid Organized? A simple pyramid -- for example, a five level program built on recruitment by fours -- might work like this:  A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization. That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company -- $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter 's ""upline"" in the form of $10 payments to the recruiter 's recruiter, and so on through five levels. continued  Minnesota law prohibits all pyramid schemes because they deceive and cheat people. But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to get-rich-quick promises.  What is a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product being sold.

From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done by the four recruits and their recruits.  Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid? Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.    Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the people r e quir ed to support the pyramid.

Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S, and hunters in this state continue to be among the safest in North America.   During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 760,000 hunters will spend tens of millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer. Last season, nearly one-third of the 19 hunting-related incidents resulted in tragedy. Two hunters died as the result of self-inflicted injuries, and four other deaths occurred because hunters violated the law and/or safe hunting practices.    Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law.   Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.   Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot!   Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.   Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.  Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it's the law!  Although no fatalities related to falls from elevated stands were reported during the 2000 firearm deer season, three fatal falls occurred during last year's archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:     Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.   Make sure all equipment is in good working order.   Always use a safety belt and/or harness.   Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Throughout the 16-day season, one firearm fatality and 17 non-fatal injuries occurred. This follows the previous safest season on record, 2001, when one fatality and 14 non-fatal injuries occurred and 1996, when one fatality and 15 non-fatal injuries occurred.      The lone firearm-related fatality, as well as three non-fatal injuries, resulted from violations of law   and/or safety practices. The non-fatal firearms incidents included 12 self-inflicted injuries. One individual died as a result of a tree-stand fall.     Any fatality or serious injury related to hunting is tragic; however, most of these incidents are preventable. Michigan's overall safety record continues to be the best in the nation. Credit belongs to hunter education efforts, safety laws (especially hunter orange, now in its 25th year) and to those individuals who volunteer their time to instruct students or who work to enforce the natural resources laws. Michigan hunters, by observing the laws and safety guidelines, have helped contribute to a 50% reduction in hunting-related injuries over the past decade.

But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit         new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to         get-rich-quick promises.            What is a Pyramid Scheme?             Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and         small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who         recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value         (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the         promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join         the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually,         there is no legitimate product being sold.            How are Pyramids Disguised?             Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational         companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call         themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what         distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new         members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal         pyramid.            How do Pyramids Work?             Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of         promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them         to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from         there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain         the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number         of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the         ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial         ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune         because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.            Why do Pyramids Fail?             Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members         are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would         have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality,         however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has         less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.            How is a Typical Pyramid Organized?            A simple pyramid — for example, a five level program built on recruitment by         fours — might work like this:            • A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.            • That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company —         $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in         the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.            • The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more         people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.            • From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done         by the four recruits and their recruits.            Pyramid Reality             • Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature         deceptive, they have been made illegal by the Minnesota legislature. There is a real risk         that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to         fines and possible arrest.            • Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not,         are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them         were fully explained.            • Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many         losers pay a few winners.            Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?             Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a         frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play         upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind         of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.            Protect Yourself            • Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any         contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear         overnight.            • Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its         officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees;         buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.            • Get copies of all available company literature.            • Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find         out if the products are actually being sold to customers.            • Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Minnesota Attorney General's         Office, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the         Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid         scheme.            Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the         people required to support the pyramid.

But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit         new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to         get-rich-quick promises.            What is a Pyramid Scheme?             Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and         small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who         recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value         (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the         promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join         the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually,         there is no legitimate product being sold.            How are Pyramids Disguised?             Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational         companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call         themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what         distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new         members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal         pyramid.            How do Pyramids Work?             Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of         promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them         to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from         there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain         the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number         of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the         ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial         ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune         because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.            Why do Pyramids Fail?             Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members         are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would         have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality,         however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has         less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.            How is a Typical Pyramid Organized?            A simple pyramid — for example, a five level program built on recruitment by         fours — might work like this:            • A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.            • That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company —         $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in         the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.            • The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more         people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.            • From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done         by the four recruits and their recruits.            Pyramid Reality             • Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature         deceptive, they have been made illegal by the Minnesota legislature. There is a real risk         that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to         fines and possible arrest.            • Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not,         are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them         were fully explained.            • Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many         losers pay a few winners.            Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?             Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a         frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play         upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind         of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.            Protect Yourself            • Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any         contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear         overnight.            • Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its         officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees;         buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.            • Get copies of all available company literature.            • Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find         out if the products are actually being sold to customers.            • Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Minnesota Attorney General's         Office, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the         Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid         scheme.            Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the         people required to support the pyramid.

Lansing, December 31, 1997 – A  Holt  man thought he was dreaming, but it was no dream – he won the top prize in the Michigan Lottery's Keno game!     After matching 10 of the Keno numbers drawn Monday, Nov. 24 – 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78 and 79 &150; the lucky winner was thrilled to learn it was true: he won the game's top prize of  $250,000 .     ""I didn't believe it,"" he said.  ""I taped the drawing and played it over and over.  I had to pinch myself because I thought it might be a dream!""     The winner, who requested anonymity, picked his own Keno numbers.  The winning ticket was purchased at  7-Eleven 028E, 1997 Aurelius Road, in Holt.      A regular Michigan Lottery player for 25 years, the winner is a State of Michigan employee.  He is the director of a Scrabble® club which competes in tournament play.  The winner said he plans to use his Keno winnings to pay bills, upgrade his computer, make home repairs and invest for his retirement.     The Keno game is designed to appeal to players wanting better odds of winning a prize.  To play Keno, a player selects 10 numbers between 1 and 80.  The Lottery draws 22 numbers from the field of 1 to 80.  Players win prizes if they match six, seven, eight, nine or all ten of their numbers to the 22 drawn by the Lottery, or even if they match no numbers at all. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000; nine numbers wins $2,500; eight wins $250; seven wins $25; six wins $7; and matching zero numbers wins a free $1 instant game ticket.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

GX023-29-11275981	"www.michigan.gov  (To Print: use your browser's print function)                Release Date:        January 01, 2002                                   The $100,000 Pyramid Scheme    11/2001                                       CONSUMER ALERT       MIKE COX    ATTORNEY GENERAL           The Attorney General provides Consumer Alerts to inform the public of unfair, misleading or deceptive business practices, and to provide information and guidance on other issues of concern.            THE      $100,000      PYRAMID SCHEME           MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING OR ILLEGAL PYRAMID SCHEME?              What is the Difference?             ""Multi-level"" or ""network"" marketing is a form of business that uses independent representatives to sell products or services to family, friends, and acquaintances. A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.                                                Copyright © 2003 State of Michigan"
GX233-31-16250765	Things You Should Know About...    Pyramid Schemes         Have you ever received a chain letter that asked you to mail one dollar to the top person on the list and forward the letter to 10 friends?  If so, you have been solicited for an illegal pyramid.    What is a Pyramid Scheme?  Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures used by  individuals, businesses, and small groups of people.  A typical pyramid scheme involves a few people at the top who recruit participants to recruit more participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization.  Participants are promised large sums of money if they successfully recruit others to pay money to join the pyramid.  Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment; usually, no legitimate product is sold.    How are Pyramid Schemes Disguised?  Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, gifting clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations.   Some pyramid schemes also call themselves multilevel marketing operations, but not all multilevel marketing companies are pyramids.  The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multilevel operations from pyramids.  If you are told you will earn commissions for recruiting new members rather than for selling something of value, the organization is probably an illegal pyramid.    How Are Pyramids Formed?  Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of “friends” and instructs them to collect more money from their “friends.”  The cycle goes on from there.    Why Do Pyramids Fail?  For a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be an endless supply of willing participants.  However, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.   In fact, pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the number of people required to support the pyramid.  A nine-level pyramid, which is built when each participant gets six “friends” to join, would involve over ten million people!    1>6  2>36  3>216  4>1,296  5>7,776  6>46,656  7>279,936  8>1,679,616  9>10,077,696     What Laws Do Pyramid Schemes Violate?  Pyramid schemes violate state criminal and civil laws.  The Illinois Criminal Code makes it a Class A misdemeanor (prison sentence of one year and $1,000 fine) for any person to knowingly sell, offer to sell, or attempt to sell the right to participate in a pyramid sales scheme.   Pyramid schemes also violate the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, which is enforced by the Consumer Fraud Bureau of the Office of the Illinois Attorney General.  The law allows the Attorney General to ask the court to impose a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000 per violation.    Pyramid Scheme Reality   Pyramids have been made illegal by the Illinois legislature.  If discovered, pyramids will be closed down by police, leaving participants subject to fines and possible arrest.  Pyramids are deceptive.  Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not, are deceiving those they recruit.  Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them were fully explained.  Pyramids are risky.  Pyramiding is based on simple mathematics: many losers pay a few winners. Back to Consumer Protection Information Listings   Back to Consumer Main Page

GX033-02-16565787	"Pyramid schemes, which are an old consumer fraud device, are reappearing          throughout Washington state. Based on consumer complaints, pyramid scheme          operators are preying on the elderly, immigrants, church members, employees          of major corporations, and even police and fire department personnel.                  Although they take different guises, all classic pyramid schemes          work the same. In every case the vast majority of participants end up          losing everything they invest. In a pyramid scheme, only a few -- usually          the con artist and a small group of accomplices who start the pyramid          -- make money. They do so by convincing others to give them as much as          $5,000, based upon a promise they will get even more in return.                                                  FTC ALERT:                 The              Gifting Club ""Gotcha""                                   Pyramid operators benefit from the fact that on the surface, their schemes          look simple. An individual is asked to contribute money, and in exchange,          as new people are recruited into the scheme, money will flow back to them.          But the results of pyramids are inevitable and predictable. All eventually          collapse and fail.                     In order for everyone to win under a pyramid scheme,          the recruiting would have to go on forever. Heres another way to think          of it. If the earths population was 5 billion and everyone got involved          in a pyramid scheme, in order for there to be 500 million winners, 4.5          billion must be losers.                   Although illegal, pyramid schemes remain popular because the promise          of quick, easy money lures people. Typical sales pitches try to convince          people they are near the top of the pyramid. And for good reason. The          following chart illustrates how difficult it is for those who are not          at the top of the pyramid to expect payment.                                     Since many people know pyramids are illegal, they also need to be          convinced that what they are involved in is not a pyramid scheme. As a          result, pyramid schemes today are being described in different terms,          such as clubs or gifting groups. Pyramid scheme operators attempt to convince          people they are involved in a club to make an investment or to raise money          by making ""gifts"" to help someone else -- like making it possible          for a single mother to buy her first house.           Pyramid schemes recently have operated throughout Western Washington          and in Ellensburg, Yakima and the Tri-Cities. A group called ""Women          Helping Women"" uses female camaraderie and empowerment as a powerful          hook. After losing their money, many of those who joined said they couldnt          afford to buy Christmas presents for their children or pay their bills.          In Mill Creek, one scheme called the ""Dinner Club"" was failing          and a fight broke out between two men who ended up in the hospital with          fairly serious injuries.            The bottom line is this: if it sounds too good to be true, it          is!         For more information, go to  Consumer          Protection's Illegal Pyramid Scheme  page."

The parent or guardian is required to sign this form in person at the Library. Internet access will be denied to all children under 18 years of age who do not have an  Internet Consent Form  on file or who are not accompanied by a parent or guardian.      To fulfill the Library's mission as a federal depository, the Library will provide unrestricted access to one unfiltered Internet workstation dedicated to assist all patrons, regardless of age, wishing to access federal government information. Patrons will not be required to show identification or a consent form to use this workstation. The workstation also includes adaptive technologies to assist patrons with disabilities.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S, and hunters in this state continue to be among the safest in North America.   During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 760,000 hunters will spend tens of millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer. Last season, nearly one-third of the 19 hunting-related incidents resulted in tragedy. Two hunters died as the result of self-inflicted injuries, and four other deaths occurred because hunters violated the law and/or safe hunting practices.    Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law.   Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.   Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot!   Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.   Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.  Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it's the law!  Although no fatalities related to falls from elevated stands were reported during the 2000 firearm deer season, three fatal falls occurred during last year's archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:     Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.   Make sure all equipment is in good working order.   Always use a safety belt and/or harness.   Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S, and hunters in this state continue to be among the safest in North America.   During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 760,000 hunters will spend tens of millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer. Last season, nearly one-third of the 19 hunting-related incidents resulted in tragedy. Two hunters died as the result of self-inflicted injuries, and four other deaths occurred because hunters violated the law and/or safe hunting practices.    Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law.   Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.   Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot!   Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.   Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.  Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it's the law!  Although no fatalities related to falls from elevated stands were reported during the 2000 firearm deer season, three fatal falls occurred during last year's archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:     Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.   Make sure all equipment is in good working order.   Always use a safety belt and/or harness.   Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.

During the 16-day season one firearm fatality and 12 non-fatal injuries occurred. This surpasses the previous safest season on record, 1996, when one fatality and 15 non-fatal injuries occurred.  The single firearm-related fatality, as well as four non-fatal injuries, resulted from hunters who failed to obey a basic tenet of safe hunting--hunters knowing their target and beyond. The non-fatal firearms incidents included five self-inflicted injuries. One individual died as a result from a treestand fall.   Although any fatality or serious injury related to hunting is tragic, most of these incidents are preventable. Michigan's overall safety record continues to be the best in the nation. Credit belongs to hunter education efforts, safety laws (especially hunter orange) and to those individuals who volunteer their time to instruct students or who work to enforce the natural resources laws. Michigan hunters, to their credit, by observing the laws and safety guidelines, also have helped contribute to a 50 percent reduction in hunting-related injuries over the past decade.

Suzanne Koppelo 517-335-3410                              Agency:                    Natural Resources                                  SAFETY FIRST DURING FIREARM DEER SEASON                        November 14, 2002    The Michigan Department of Natural Resources urges all hunters to continue to practice Safety First! when they hunt this fall.     Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S. During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 750,000 hunters will spend millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer.     While Michigan continues to be one of the safest places to hunt white-tailed deer, hunters are still urged to practice Safety First! Last season, one-third of the 15 hunting-related incidents involved self-inflicted injuries. The remainders, including one fatality, were attributed to violations of the law and/or safety practices.       Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     • Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law, a law, now in its twenty-fifth year, that has proven to save lives!     • Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.     • Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot.     • Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.     • Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.           • Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it’s the law!         One fatality related to a fall from an elevated stand occurred during the 2001 firearm deer season, three fatal falls have occurred during the 2002 archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:         • Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.     • Make sure all equipment is in good working order.     • Always use a safety belt and/or harness.     • Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   • Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.         Enjoy a safe, successful hunting season!                                                                                                                                                              Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                Spring turkey hunting application period starts Jan. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Program On Call To Help  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Spring turkey hunting application period starts Jan. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Safety must be first consideration when clearing driveway                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Unemployment Program To Open Phone Lines To Accept  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Sponsors and Partners Help Library of Michigan Build Momentum  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                American Association of School Librarians Commends Michigan  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Welfare Cases Decreased Again in November                                                                                                                                                                                                                         >                MDOT follows up on Transportation Summit, seeks public input a ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Service, safety, savings are highlights of Secretary Land's  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Oakland County Boy's Death Was Flu-Associated                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                State Responds to Increase in Homeland Security Advisory Level                                                                                                                                             Michigan.gov Home    |    Home    |    State Web Sites    |    Contact Michigan Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

Suzanne Koppelo 517-335-3410                              Agency:                    Natural Resources                                  SAFETY FIRST DURING FIREARM DEER SEASON                        November 14, 2002    The Michigan Department of Natural Resources urges all hunters to continue to practice Safety First! when they hunt this fall.     Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S. During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 750,000 hunters will spend millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer.     While Michigan continues to be one of the safest places to hunt white-tailed deer, hunters are still urged to practice Safety First! Last season, one-third of the 15 hunting-related incidents involved self-inflicted injuries. The remainders, including one fatality, were attributed to violations of the law and/or safety practices.       Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     • Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law, a law, now in its twenty-fifth year, that has proven to save lives!     • Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.     • Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot.     • Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.     • Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.           • Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it’s the law!         One fatality related to a fall from an elevated stand occurred during the 2001 firearm deer season, three fatal falls have occurred during the 2002 archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:         • Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.     • Make sure all equipment is in good working order.     • Always use a safety belt and/or harness.     • Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   • Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.         Enjoy a safe, successful hunting season!                                                                                                                                                              Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                Spring turkey hunting application period starts Jan. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Program On Call To Help  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Spring turkey hunting application period starts Jan. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Safety must be first consideration when clearing driveway                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Unemployment Program To Open Phone Lines To Accept  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Sponsors and Partners Help Library of Michigan Build Momentum  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                American Association of School Librarians Commends Michigan  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan's Welfare Cases Decreased Again in November                                                                                                                                                                                                                         >                MDOT follows up on Transportation Summit, seeks public input a ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Service, safety, savings are highlights of Secretary Land's  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Oakland County Boy's Death Was Flu-Associated                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                State Responds to Increase in Homeland Security Advisory Level                                                                                                                                             Michigan.gov Home    |    Home    |    State Web Sites    |    Contact Michigan Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Accessibility Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan

During the 16-day season one firearm fatality and 12 non-fatal injuries occurred. This surpasses the previous safest season on record, 1996, when one fatality and 15 non-fatal injuries occurred.  The single firearm-related fatality, as well as four non-fatal injuries, resulted from hunters who failed to obey a basic tenet of safe hunting--hunters knowing their target and beyond. The non-fatal firearms incidents included five self-inflicted injuries. One individual died as a result from a treestand fall.   Although any fatality or serious injury related to hunting is tragic, most of these incidents are preventable. Michigan's overall safety record continues to be the best in the nation. Credit belongs to hunter education efforts, safety laws (especially hunter orange) and to those individuals who volunteer their time to instruct students or who work to enforce the natural resources laws. Michigan hunters, to their credit, by observing the laws and safety guidelines, also have helped contribute to a 50 percent reduction in hunting-related injuries over the past decade.

Throughout the 16-day season, one firearm fatality and 17 non-fatal injuries occurred. This follows the previous safest season on record, 2001, when one fatality and 14 non-fatal injuries occurred and 1996, when one fatality and 15 non-fatal injuries occurred.      The lone firearm-related fatality, as well as three non-fatal injuries, resulted from violations of law   and/or safety practices. The non-fatal firearms incidents included 12 self-inflicted injuries. One individual died as a result of a tree-stand fall.     Any fatality or serious injury related to hunting is tragic; however, most of these incidents are preventable. Michigan's overall safety record continues to be the best in the nation. Credit belongs to hunter education efforts, safety laws (especially hunter orange, now in its 25th year) and to those individuals who volunteer their time to instruct students or who work to enforce the natural resources laws. Michigan hunters, by observing the laws and safety guidelines, have helped contribute to a 50% reduction in hunting-related injuries over the past decade.

Prison Build officials said the eight by ten feet mini-barns are being used as storage sheds since the Habitat homes do not have garages. One was built earlier at the Straits Correctional Facility for a home in Sault Ste. Marie.      The sheds are becoming part of the standard home packages offered by some Habitat affiliates.      In other Prison Build news, a large storage barn is nearing completion at the Saginaw Correctional Facility. It will allow the department to store large quantities of building materials purchased by Habitat for Humanity to take advantage of lower costs and to maximize the value of state grants.

Prison Build officials said the eight by ten feet mini-barns are being used as storage sheds since the Habitat homes do not have garages. One was built earlier at the Straits Correctional Facility for a home in Sault Ste. Marie.      The sheds are becoming part of the standard home packages offered by some Habitat affiliates.      In other Prison Build news, a large storage barn is nearing completion at the Saginaw Correctional Facility. It will allow the department to store large quantities of building materials purchased by Habitat for Humanity to take advantage of lower costs and to maximize the value of state grants.      The storage barn and building supplies are being paid for with grants from the Michigan State Housing Authority and by Habitat for Humanity of Michigan.

Mulhern worked at the Masco Corporation Governor's House, a one and one-half    story bungalow, built for homeowner Winifred Jones and his three children. Mulhern    spoke at the house dedication and closing ceremony, where he officially presented    Jones with his home. Jones is the first single father to receive a home from    Habitat for Humanity.    Mulhern said, ""The Governor talked about One Michigan, and at a Habitat    site it's not just talk. There were people from as far as Benton Harbor, corporate    people, non-profit, old, young, black, white and everything in between. If you    need to renew your hope, and build someone else's click on the link below. There    is still a ton of work necessary to complete Winfred's home and the other 15    homes that were raised up from the ground at the Blitz Build.""   >  Habitat    for Humanity Detroit: Blitz Build '03  website    >  Governor's    Press Release                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Some                photos courtesy of D.

Granholm and Habitat for Humanity International (HBHI) today announced that the international organization’s signature event will be held in Michigan in 2005.     At press conferences in Detroit and Benton Harbor, Granholm and Habitat for Humanity International Founder and President Millard Fuller declared Detroit and Benton Harbor host cities for the 2005 Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP).  The builds will be held in each city from June 19 to June 24, 2005.     Granholm and Fuller will join the former President and 2002 Noble Peace Prize laureate, along with his wife Rosalynn and an estimated 3,000 volunteers from the U.S. and around the world, as they build houses in partnership with families in need.     “Habitat for Humanity’s focus on Detroit and Benton Harbor demonstrates the importance of all of our citizens working together to build homes, to build lives, and most importantly, to build bridges between us,’’ said Granholm.  “We appreciate their support and look forward to working with them.’’     Carter has been a long-time supporter of the nonprofit, nondenominational Christian housing organization.  He became actively involved with it after leaving office in 1981.     Carter hosts a JCWP every year somewhere in the world.  In 2002, he built homes in Durban, South Africa; in 2003, he is building homes in Georgia and Alabama; next year, he will build homes in Mexico.     Detroit and Benton Harbor had been under consideration by Habitat officials as potential sites since early in the year.  The housing needs in those communities and the presence of strong Habitat affiliates were deciding factors.     “The Jimmy Carter Work Project provides a wonderful opportunity to continue to strengthen and build Habitat’s ministry across the state of Michigan and engage people from all walks of life to volunteer and come together to eliminate poverty housing from Michigan and the world,’’  said Fuller.        The state of Michigan has strong ties to Habitat for Humanity.  Since 1986, Habitat Detroit has helped to house more than 100 families in the city of Detroit.  Michigan has 80 Habitat affiliates, more than any other state.  Michigan State University has the largest Habitat for Humanity student chapter in the world.  The Michigan Department of Corrections Prison Build is also the largest prison build program in the world.  (The Prison Build Program builds the door frames, window frames, walls, and some cabinetry.)  Whirlpool Corporation, headquartered in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, provides appliances (stoves and refrigerators) for every Habitat home built in the United States.  The Michigan State Housing Development Authority has provided over $20 million (over a several year period) to Habitat affiliates to help homeowners buy-down the cost of their homes by $10,000 per home.     Since 1976, Habitat has built more than 150,000 houses in more than 89 countries, including some 50,000 houses across the United States.

Volunteers from state agencies, including 16 corrections staff and administrators, spent several days working on the Detroit Habitat home.    During the week, families, sponsors and volunteers helped to build 16 houses on one city block in Detroit. It was one of the largest week-long builds in Habitat history for Michigan. The families who qualified for houses worked along side volunteers to witness and participate in the building of their homes. The families purchase the homes through zero-percent interest mortgages.                   Regional Prison Administrator Dennis Straub and Acting Deputy Director James MacMeekin         In addition to the Department of Corrections providing volunteers, the Prison Build Program also built all 16 sets of interior and exterior wall panels for the project. Each of the wall panels was delivered to the site by soldiers of the Michigan Army National Guard.    ""Both Habitat for Humanity of Michigan and the Governor’s Office gave praise and thanks to the corrections department and the Prison Build Program for helping to lead the effort,"" said Mike Green, Administrator of the Prison Build Program.    Over the course of the week, a total of 120 State employees worked on the Habitat build. DOC individuals who were selected to participate represented nearly every administration in corrections. In fact, response from the corrections staff was so good that not everyone who volunteered could be offered an opportunity to work on the house. Their names are being kept on a list as a resource for next year if a similar opportunity arises.    ""Corrections staff stepped up to the plate once again, volunteering their time and efforts to help build a home for a family that might not otherwise have the opportunity to own a safe and decent place to live,"" said DOC Director Patricia L. Caruso. ""In addition, the Prison Build Program continues to improve communities by assisting low-income families in securing housing.""                   Mound Warden Andrew Jackson and Susan Babcock, wife of Mike Babcock, Pine River Physical Plant Inspector.          The house is being built for Winifred Jones and his three children. He is the first single father selected to be a recipient of a Habitat for Humanity Detroit house.    Masco Corporation has partnered with Habitat for Humanity to sponsor the Governor’s State of Michigan House.

The walls for the houses were pre-built at the Saginaw Correctional Facility. ""Our crews assisted in pouring foundations and basements,"" said Mike Hamilton, Program Manager, Buena Vista Corrections Center. ""They also assisted with building the homes and completing the landscaping.""    ""We could not have completed the projects on time without their help,"" said Charlie Wargal, the field supervisor of the projects. ""The crews were invaluable.""    ""We also have a success story involving the program,"" explained Hamilton.    Bill Clingaman was a resident of the Buena Vista Corrections Center in 2001. During his stay there, he was assigned to Officer Walter Wysopal’s community service work crew and assisted with the Habitat for Humanity project. He had previous building experience with his grandfather’s construction business, Jacobs Builders in Bay City. As a result of the Habitat for Humanity work, he was able to gain employment through L & T Construction who had also worked with Habitat. In 2002 he went back and assisted Habitat for Humanity, this time as an employee for L & T Construction. On June 6, 2003, he received his parole. He is also getting his Builder’s License and has started his own construction company, Clingaman Builders.    Saginaw Habitat for Humanity asked Clingaman if he would like to help them out during their June 2003 Saginaw Blitz, which is celebrating their 100th home built in Saginaw. He accepted the request and because of his hard work and dedication to the Saginaw Habitat for Humanity, the organization assigned him as the House Leader of the organization’s celebrated 100th house. He considered this quite an honor. He is in charge of making sure that the house meets code and can be turned over to the new owner on Saturday.

The corrections personnel along with community volunteers worked under the direction of St. Louis Correctional Facility Warden Paul Renico who is a licensed builder. The house was ready for plumbers and electricians by the end of the day.         Along with volunteering on the building site, Warden Renico serves on the board of directors for the Gratiot County Affiliate of Habitat for Humanity.         “This program is a win win for the department and the community,” said Warden Renico. “It provides excellent training for prisoners in the vocational program and it doesn’t cost the department a cent for material.”         Habitat for Humanity provides raw material to the prisons where inmates turn it into wall panels and cabinets for the homes.                         “Under normal circumstances this is a great program, but in these tight budget times, it’s fantastic,” added Warden Renico. “Not only are we providing an opportunity for people to own a home that might not otherwise have the opportunity, the prisoners are able to give something back to the community.”      According to Mike Green, administrator for the Prison Build Program, 18 facilities are involved in providing prebuilt wall panels, kitchen and bathroom cabinets, sheds and horticulture products for low-income families. Since the program’s inception in 1998, more than 400 homes have been built as a result of this nationally-recognized program.         “With the help of great corrections staff, we’re assisting inmates with job skills that will help them succeed when they are released,” said Green. “At the same time we’re helping to provide much needed low-income housing in the community.” Photos courtesy the Morning Sun Michigan                   Department of Corrections, May 29, 2003                                                                                        Related Content                                                                                                                                                        >                Article from Detroit News                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Michigan to host 2005 Jimmy Carter Work Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Corrections employees join Governor Granholm in Habitat for  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Corrections center crews assist Habitat for Humanity build                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Article from Holland Sentinel                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Prison Build Program approved                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Saginaw Prison Build helps local cops                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Prison Build Program to help Tree of Hope to ""live"" on                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Mini-barns being produced by Prison Build                                                                                                                                                                                                                        >                Capitol holiday tree to be used in prison-built houses                                                                                                                                            Michigan.gov Home    |    MDOC Home    |    Site Map    |    Contact MDOC    |    State Web Sites Accessibility Policy    |    Privacy Policy    |    Link Policy    |    Security Policy Copyright © 2001-2003 State of Michigan"
