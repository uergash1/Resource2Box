This represents an increase of $4.8 billion, or 49 percent, since 1994-95. For the 2002-03 school year, the calculation of State aid has been simplified by creation of a new Comprehensive Operating Aid formula which will replace four previously existing categories of aid. Increased funding will be available for programs that serve at-risk pupils, as well as for programs that assist schools in meeting the State's higher learning standards. Continued funding is available for early childhood education and for class size reduction initiatives. In addition, changes are enacted for State aid for certain school construction projects. The 2002-03 State budget also includes a cost of living adjustment for STAR senior income eligibility effective with the 2003-04 school year. Major elements of State support for elementary and secondary education for the 2002-03 school year include the following:  An overall increase of $410.79 million (2.89 percent) in school aid, including an increase of $420.02 million (3.09 percent) in formula-based computerized aids.1 A $59.44 million increase to 445 below-average wealth school districts through the new Comprehensive Operating Aid formula. A $41.70 million, or 6.16 percent, increase in Extraordinary Needs Aid to provide funding to districts with concentrations of at-risk pupils. An increase of $74.63 million, or 54.24 percent, in Operating Standards Aid to support services and expenses        1  The 2002-03 enacted computerized aid total for school districts is based upon formula aid calculations. For the most part, this was not the case for the previous school year. In August 2001, the Legislature adopted a baseline budget for the 2001-02 school year. The baseline budget provided a statewide total for computerized aid of $12,076.82 million. Rather than a formuladerived total, each school district received an amount equal to the district total set forth in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget.  1   related to achieving the State's higher learning standards.  A new $24.92 million Academic Support Aid to provide funding to improve academic performance in the State's Big Five City school districts. An additional $5.78 million, for a total of $43.20 million, to assist school districts in operating summer programs and to provide courses to improve student performance in required academic subjects or to prepare for Regents examinations. Building Aid will be funded at $1,234.90 million including nearly $140 million in Capital Outlay Transition grants. This total funding level reflects implementation of reforms enacted in Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001 whereby the State will reimburse its share of school construction projects over the useful life of the project. Funding of $2,247.51 million is available to provide public and private excess cost aid for programs for pupils with disabilities. To promote education of disabled children with their non-disabled peers, a pupil weighting of 0.5 will be added to the existing public excess cost aid weighting for severely disabled children to generate additional aid for those children who require special education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive these services in a general education setting. Continued funding is provided for Universal Prekindergarten Aid ($204.68 million), for Class Size Reduction programs ($139.97 million), and for Minor Maintenance Aid ($49.97 million). An increase of $11.30 million is allocated for Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive Aid to provide funding for 2002-03 programs as well as to aid districts that first offered full-day kindergarten programs in the 2001-02 school year, but which did not receive funding in the 2001-02 State budget. An increase of $79.03 million is provided for expensebased Transportation Aid. Statewide, up to $5 million continues to be available for reimbursement of summer school transportation expenses.            2     For the 2002-03 school year, aid for BOCES services, based on 2001-02 school district expenditures, will total $510.91 million. Eligibility for Special Services Aid has been expanded. For the 2002-03 school year, $128.39 million will be provided both to the Big Five City school districts and to other districts that are non-components of BOCES. The 2002-03 State budget authorizes the Municipal Bond Bank Agency to issue bonds to accelerate payment of prior year aid claims to school districts. The Big Five City school districts and other districts with over $1 million in such claims are eligible for financing to accelerate nearly $470 million in prior year claim payments. For the 2002-03 school year, the Charter School Stimulus fund will continue to provide $6 million to support charter school start-up efforts throughout the State including $2.15 million for the SUNY Charter School Institute which provides technical assistance for charter schools. STAR property tax relief will increase by $100 million, from $1.99 billion in 2001-02 to an estimated $2.09 billion in 2002-03, to support the $50,000 full value exemption for income-eligible seniors and the $30,000 full value exemption for other homeowners. A key component of the 2002-03 budget for the STAR program is a cost of living adjustment (COLA) for senior income eligibility. Effective with applications for the 2003-04 school year, the COLA will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income will not make seniors who receive enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. In addition, legislation was enacted which provides seniors with the option of having their income eligibility for the enhanced STAR benefit verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Seniors who elect the income verification option as part of their application for the 2003-04 school year will not have to reapply for the exemption in the following years. They will be automatically renewed as long as their income eligibility and homeowner status remain unchanged.          3   2002-03 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS A summary of the 2002-03 school aid and STAR programs contained in Chapter 83 of the Laws of 2002, as well as related programs contained primarily in the Education, Labor and Family Assistance Budget (Chapter 53) of the Laws of 2002 is presented in this publication. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will increase the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools (GSPS), BOCES Aid and Employment Preparation Education (EPE) Aid by $410.79 million, from $14,191.30 million in 2001-02 to $14,602.09 million in the 2002-03 school year, an increase of 2.89 percent. Formula-based computerized aids will increase by $420.02 million or 3.09 percent. Significant items for 2002-03 include:  A new simplified Comprehensive Operating Aid will replace four previous aids (Operating Aid, Tax Effort and Tax Equalization Aid and the Transition Adjustment calculation). Comprehensive Operating Aid will provide $6,869.92 million to the 680 public school districts statewide including $59.44 million in increases to the State's 445 below-average wealth school districts. Operating Standards Aid is enriched to provide $212.21 million, an increase of $74.63 million. This aid supports school districts in providing programs and services to help students meet the learning standards established by the Board of Regents. A new Academic Support Aid will provide $24.92 million to improve student performance on the learning standards in the State's Big Five City school districts. New York City will receive $12.82 million, or 51 percent, of the statewide total for this aid category. The Extraordinary Needs Aid formula will provide $718.75 million in funding, a $41.70 million increase, to districts with concentrations of pupils with extraordinary needs. Funding of $2,247.51 million is available to provide excess cost aid for public and private programs for pupils with disabilities. A public excess cost pupil weighting of 0.5 will generate aid for those children who require special          4   education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive these services in a general education setting. Additional formula adjustments include a pupil weighting change for those pupils receiving special services or programs 60 percent or more of the school day and an adjustment to the save-harmless calculation.  As a result of Building Aid payment changes enacted by the legislature in October 2001 (Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001), the State will begin reimbursing school districts for the State share of the cost of building projects over the useful life of the projects. For the 2002-03 school year, $1,234.90 million will be paid to school districts in continuing support of approved school construction projects statewide. These payments include $140 million in 2002-03 Capital Outlay Transition Grants which provide continued payment to school districts for ""hard dollar"" expenditures as the State aligns the payment of Building Aid for all projects with assumed amortization requirements. For the 2002-03 school year, aid for BOCES services will be $510.91 million, an increase of $55.64 million or 12.22 percent. Districts will receive aid based on 2001-02 school year expenditures. For the 2002-03 school year Special Services Aid will total $128.39 million. Eligibility for Special Services Aid has been expanded to include not only the Big Five City school districts, but all other school districts which are not components of a BOCES. An increase of $79.03 million is provided for expense-based Transportation Aid. This amount will fully fund all projected school district increases for aidable transportation expenditures. A total of $263.05 million, an increase of $4.53 million or 1.75 percent, is provided for the textbook, software and hardware aid categories. Computer Software Aid is increased by $0.49 million or 1.09 percent. Textbook Aid is increased by $3.94 million or 2.12 percent. Computer Hardware Aid is increased by $0.10 million or 0.36 percent.          5     LADDER  A total of $204.68 million is continued for Prekindergarten Aid, which is reflective of recent school district expenditures for this program. This total amount will be provided through a combination of State funding and Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. Class Size Reduction is funded at $139.97 million. This represents continuation of the previous funding level for this program. School districts offering full-day kindergarten programs will receive $16.18 million for 2002-03, an $11.30 million increase. In addition to providing funds for new 2002-03 programs, funding is included for those districts which first implemented full-day kindergarten programs in 2001-02, but did not receive aid under the enacted 2001-02 State budget. For 2002-03, Minor Maintenance is funded at $49.97 million. New York City will receive $33.33 million of the statewide total.          Continued General Support for Public School funding is provided for various categorical aid programs including: Teacher Support Aid ($67.48 million), Teacher Centers ($30 million) and the Teacher-Mentor Intern program ($5 million). Chapter 53 of the Laws of 2002 also includes additional funding of $1 million outside of General Support for Public Schools for each of the latter two programs. The ""Teachers of Tomorrow"" initiative will be continued at $25.00 million. The program provides assistance to school districts, including the Big Five City schools, in their efforts to increase the supply of qualified entry-level teachers. Small Cities Aid ($81.88 million) and Bilingual Grants ($11.20 million) will be continued at 2001-02 funding levels. The 2002-03 State Budget provides funding of $57 million for payment of statewide prior year claims and/or fiscal stabilization grants including $33 million for payment to        6   New York City. In addition, the 2002-03 State budget authorizes the Municipal Bond Bank Agency (MBBA) to issue bonds to accelerate payment of prior year aid claims. Eligible school districts include the Big Five City school districts and other school districts with more than $1 million in such claims. MBBA financing will permit acceleration of prior year claim payments of nearly $470 million including $435 million for New York City.  FORMULA-BASED AIDS Comprehensive Operating Aid: In 2001-02 there was no separate Operating Aid, Tax Effort Aid, Tax Equalization Aid or Transition Adjustment calculation as these aids were incorporated within the baseline school aid amount enacted by the Legislature. For 2002-03 a single Comprehensive Operating Aid will replace these previous aids.2 Each district will receive Comprehensive Operating Aid equal to a calculation based on the 2001-02 Executive Budget Flex Aid amount set forth in the January 2001 computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" minus the 2000-01 aids listed below:         Gifted and Talented Aid Minor Maintenance Aid Public Excess Cost Aid Private Excess Cost Aid Educationally Related Support Services Aid Extraordinary Needs Aid Operating Standards Aid Limited English Proficiency Aid  Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio of less than 1.000 will receive a one percent increase in Comprehensive Operating Aid. Statewide, 445 districts will receive aid increases totaling $59.44 million. (New York City will receive $24.34 million, or 41 percent, of this amount.) For the 2002-03 school year, this aid will total $6,869.92 million. Operating Standards Aid: For 2002-03, $212.21 million, an increase of $74.63 million, will be available for services and 2  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid (as cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used.  7   expenses related to achieving the Board of Regents' high learning standards. The aid per pupil amount has been increased from $7.50 to $8.50. Increased funding is available for school districts with a high percentage of at-risk pupils. Additional aid will also be provided to school districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio less than .700. A save-harmless provision guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2000-01. Academic Support Aid: A total of $24.92 million for academic improvement is provided to Big Five City school districts through this new aid category. These funds will be allocated as follows:      New York City Yonkers Syracuse Buffalo Rochester $12,820,000 5,700,000 2,280,000 2,100,000 2,020,000  Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of limited English proficient and other at-risk pupils. Several formula enhancements first enacted in 1998-99 are continued, including a recalculation of the concentration and sparsity factors. The save-harmless provision guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2000-01. Extraordinary Needs Aid will provide $718.75 million to school districts, an increase of $41.70 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula, which supports school district programs for special needs students, continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the formula Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum. The second uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the Extraordinary Needs percent in excess of 60 percent and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The aid ceiling for the first per-pupil calculation is $365.00; that for the second is $635.00. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 9 percent; that for the second is 15 percent. For 2002-03, this aid will total $73.54 million, an increase of $3.46 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: This program supports the commitment to a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for pupils with disabilities. For aids payable  8   in 2002-03, the calculation of Public Excess Cost Aid will be based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 2000-01 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $7,400. The aid ratio will be determined using the Combined Wealth Ratio and based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. For 2002-03, the public excess cost pupil weightings contain a 0.5 weighting for those children who required special education services in the year prior to the base year at least 60 percent of the time and who received these services in a general education setting. The pupil weighting for students served in segregated settings in the base year will be 1.68 for aid paid in 2002-03. The save-harmless provision is revised to ensure that no district will receive less than 95 percent of the amount paid for 2001-02. Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for Public Excess Cost Aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid equals 50 percent of a district's Public Excess Cost Aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Public Excess Cost Aid will total $2,074.78 million in 2002-03, an increase of $221.73 million. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs serving public school children placed in private school settings and in the State-operated schools in Rome and Batavia. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 2002-03 will total $172.73 million, an increase of $26.89 million. BOCES Aid: For 2002-03, aid to reimburse districts for expenditures for BOCES services in the 2001-02 school year will total $510.91 million, an increase of $55.64 million. Beginning with contracts entered into on or after January 15, 2000, school districts are not eligible for BOCES Aid for the purchase or installation of educational technology unless a district can demonstrate that this shared service is costeffective without regard to the availability of State aid. For the 2002-03 school year, the use of BOCES in the provision of Academic Intervention Services (AIS) to improve student  9   performance must continue to be approved by the State Education Department to be aid eligible. As is the case with the technology cost-effectiveness requirement, districts must demonstrate, not only that district resources were insufficient to provide appropriate Academic Intervention Services, but that accessing BOCES services is a cost-effective solution. Special Services Aid: For 2002-03, eligibility for Special Services Aid for career education and computer services has been expanded to include all school districts which are not components of a BOCES. This aid, which totals $128.39 million for 2002-03, a decrease of $3.12 million, was previously provided only to the Big Five City school districts. Since these five districts are not permitted to join BOCES, a different formula (now applicable to all non-component districts) is used to fund career education programs and computer services provided by such districts. The career education aid ceiling for 2002-03 is continued at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. Transportation Aid: For 2002-03, the minimum aid ratio for Transportation Aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, this aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved transportation expenses). Transportation Aid will total $1,017.67 million in 2002-03, an increase of $79.03 million. The aid ratio choice permitting school districts to receive aid based on public and non-public enrollments is continued and will benefit districts transporting large numbers of nonpublic school students. District expenditures for transportation to and from school district operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5 million statewide. Districts may claim aid based on the transportation of pupils in summer school courses to improve performance during the summer of 2001. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year. Limited English Proficiency: For 2002-03, the LEP per pupil calculation based on formula Operating Aid has been restored. As a result, school district programs for the education of  10   students with limited proficiency in English will be supported by $68.60 million, a decrease of $1.41 million. Gifted and Talented: For 2002-03, $15.35 million, an increase of $0.97 million is available to fund programs for gifted students. Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid: Reorganization Incentive Aid is provided for operating expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law. It is paid as a supplement based on formula Operating Aid when districts meet certain conditions prescribed by law. Beginning in 1992, reorganization incentive operating aid for reorganizing districts was increased to 40 percent for the first five years. The statutory provisions for reorganization incentive operating aid remain unchanged. In total Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid will amount to $19.25 million in 2002-03, a decrease of $2.06 million. Textbook and Computer Aids: For the 2002-03 school year, the following provisions apply:  Textbook Aid: These funds reimburse school districts for the purchase and loan of textbooks. Textbooks are loaned to both public and nonpublic pupils. The lottery funded portion of Textbook Aid is $15.00 per pupil. The general fund portion will be $42.30 per pupil, for a combined maximum textbook aid payment of $57.30 per pupil. Schools are also able to qualify for reimbursement based on eligible purchases of content-based instructional materials in an electronic format. This aid will total $189.89 million in 2002-03, an increase of $3.94 million. Computer Software Aid: Under this program, aid is apportioned to districts for the purchase and loan of computer software. Software programs designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils pursuant to Rules of the Board of Regents. For the 2002-03 school year, districts will be reimbursed for expenses up to $14.98 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2002-03, Computer Software Aid will total $45.43 million, an increase of $0.49 million. Instructional Computer Hardware and Technology Equipment Aid: This aid category provides funding for the lease or purchase of mini- and microcomputers, computer terminals 11       or technology equipment for instructional purposes and repair and staff development. Computer Hardware Aid equals approved expense (up to $19.25 per pupil, adjusted by the current year AV/RWADA aid ratio). For the 2002-03 school year, $27.73 million, an increase of $0.10 million, is provided. Library Materials Aid: Districts are reimbursed for expenses up to $6.00 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2002-03, Library Materials Aid will total $19.38 million, an increase of $0.39 million. Materials purchased under this program and designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils. Prekindergarten: Beginning in 1998-99, State funds were provided to expand the availability of prekindergarten programs for four-year-old children statewide. For 2002-03, a total of $204.68 million is continued for State prekindergarten grants. This total amount will be provided through a combination of State funding and Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. Early Grade Class Size Reduction Aid: For 2002-03, $139.97 million is continued to enable school districts to reduce class size in kindergarten and in grades one through three. Full-Day K Incentive Aid: This aid category provides funding to encourage school districts to establish full-day kindergarten programs intended to strengthen the quality of education for five-year-old children. School districts first offering full-day kindergarten programs in 2002-03 will receive current year formula Operating Aid for any increase in the number of students served in full-day programs in 2002-03 compared to 2001-02. In addition, those districts that first offered programs in the 2001-02 school year, but did not receive aid in the enacted 2001-02 State budget for the increased number of students served in full day programs in 2001-02 compared to 2000-01, will receive that aid in 2002-03. For 2002-03, a total of $16.18 million, an increase of $11.30 million, is provided for this program. Minor Maintenance Aid: For 2002-03, $49.97 million will be reinstituted for support of minor maintenance projects necessary to preserve school facilities statewide. School districts will receive funding based upon the average age of their facilities and upon enrollment growth.  12   Tax Limitation Aid: For 2002-03, a total of $25.00 million is provided to school districts through this formula aid calculated using district tax levy from residential property and overall district income. Summer School Aid: In 2000-01, a new summer school program was established to fund school district courses to improve student performance in required academic subjects or in taking Regents examinations. For 2002-03, this aid will total $43.20 million, an increase of $5.78 million. School districts that provided transportation for pupils to district operated summer school programs for the 2001 summer school session may claim Transportation Aid for such services in the 2002-03 school year. Such aid will be capped at a statewide total of $5.00 million. While BOCES may operate summer session programs on a shared services basis, BOCES may not claim aid for summer programs under this new aid category. Building/Reorganization Incentive Building Aid: For 2002-03 Building Aid to support school building projects throughout the State (including Reorganization Incentive Aid for building expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law) will total $1,234.90 million. The 10 percent Building Aid enrichment provided for projects approved July 1, 1998 and thereafter is continued in 2002-03. Projects approved by voters beginning July 1, 2000 receive Building Aid based on the greater of their current year AV/RWADA aid ratio or their 1999-00 Building Aid ratio reduced by 10 percentage points. Reforms included in Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001 provide that, beginning July 1, 2002, the State share of all bonded projects, both existing and future, will be paid to school districts on the basis of assumed amortization. The reimbursement period will be tied to the useful life of the project. The 2002-03 State Budget conforms the payment of State aid for hard dollar projects with the recently enacted reforms for bonded projects. A total of $140 million in Capital Outlay Transition Grants is made available to school districts to aid in the transition from the previous reimbursement system for hard dollar projects to one based on assumed amortization. Beginning with Building Aid payable in the 2003-04 school year for school district expenditures made during the 2002-03 school year, aid for hard dollar expenditures will be calculated  13   based on the useful life of the project (15 years for reconstruction, 20 years for major construction/additions and 30 years for new buildings). Teacher Support Aid: For the 2002-03 school year, $67.48 million will be available for this Big Five City school district program. Growth Aid: Growth Aid to qualifying districts will be paid as a separate apportionment in June 2003. As provided for in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996, a district's growth index is calculated based on the change in enrollment rather than the change in average daily attendance. For 2002-03, Growth aid will total $30.20 million, an increase of $18.39 million. GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER AID CATEGORIES Teachers of Tomorrow: For 2002-03, $25 million will continue to be available for incentives such as awards and stipends to retain and attract teachers into New York's classrooms, particularly in areas where teacher shortages exist. Of available funds, $15 million, or 60 percent, will go to New York City. Teacher Resource and Computer Training Centers: General Support for Public School funding of $30.00 million is available for this program in the 2002-03 school year.

Senior homeowners at least 65 years old and with incomes up to $60,000 are eligible to receive exemptions of at least $50,000 from the full value of their primary residences for school tax purposes. The property tax component of the STAR program will also provide other homeowners with at least a $30,000 exemption from the full value of their primary residence for school property tax purposes. In those counties where the median value of homes exceeds the statewide median home value, as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS), the value of the exemptions will be increased. The State will reimburse school districts dollar-for-dollar for the property tax revenues foregone from these exemptions. School District Reimbursement for STAR STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies to the Commissioner of Education amounts payable under the STAR program and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements in the 2002-03 school year will follow the same accelerated formula as last year. Under the accelerated schedule, 35% of a district's school tax relief aid reimbursement will be paid in October and an additional 35% in November. Ten percent will be paid in December and the balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003. 2002-2003 Budget Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for Senior Income Eligibility: A cost of living adjustment (COLA) will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income  24   will not make seniors who receive Enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. Effective for applications filed in 2003 and later, the $60,000 income limit will be increased annually in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Senior Income Verification: The Budget includes legislation which establishes a STAR income verification program for seniors applying for the enhanced exemption. With their 2003-04 application, seniors will have the option of allowing their income eligibility in future years to be verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Once they have chosen this option, seniors will no longer be required to reapply in subsequent years. Third Party Notice: School districts will no longer be responsible for administering third party notification for senior STAR recipients. As enacted in Chapter 83 of the Laws of 2002, effective for 2003 STAR applications, local assessors will take over the responsibility of sending renewal notices to designated third parties.  25   OTHER INITIATIVES Chapters 53 and 83 of the Laws of 2002, as well as other enacted 2002 legislation, include educational programs and initiatives regarding mandate relief measures, school personnel, extended day child education and teacher quality. Mandate Relief: Currently, school districts statewide must allocate staff time and resources to the completion of over 50 plans and reports imposed on the districts by the State Education Department (SED). In an effort to reduce this reporting burden, the enacted 2002-03 State budget directs the Commissioner of Education to review all of the plans and reports now required to be completed by school districts. On or before June 1, 2003, the Commissioner must report to the Director of the Budget and to the Legislature on SED's efforts to determine if there is a need for continued annual submission of such reports and on its efforts to reduce excess reporting requirements. Early Retirement: To help reduce local costs, Chapter 69 of the laws of 2002 provides two early retirement incentive programs for school district and other public employees. School districts may chose to ""opt in"" to the first, standard retirement incentive program, which allows for the accumulation of one month of additional service credit for each year of employment up to 36 months. An additional, one-time program, will enable anyone aged 55 with 25 years of service to retire without penalty. Advantage Schools: The Advantage Schools initiative continues to provide a secure and enriching environment for children during those hours after school ends but before many parents are home from work. At over 160 sites statewide, children from kindergarten through 12th grade have opportunities for enriching experiences that complement their education in a safe, supportive program operating in neighborhood schools. The State Budget appropriates $25.00 million, an increase of $5.00 million, to the Office of Children and Family Services for Advantage Schools in 2002-03. New York City School Reform: Chapter 91 of the Laws of 2002 amends the Education Law to give the Mayor of New York City new powers and greater control over City schools, including the power to appoint the New York City Schools Chancellor. The Chancellor will serve at the pleasure of the Mayor and will head a thirteen-member board  expanded from the previous seven-  26   member board - which will advise the Chancellor on matters of policy. The new law provides the Chancellor with the power to appoint community school district superintendents. The law gives the Mayor sole control of the School Construction Authority (SCA) by authorizing him to appoint two members of the board, with the Chancellor serving as the third member. Effective June 30, 2003, the law also repeals statutory provisions that originally established the existing thirty-two community school boards. A task force will be established to discuss possible models to replace the community school boards, and will submit its recommendations to the Governor and Legislature by February 15, 2003. Finally, the legislation includes a maintenance of effort provision which requires New York City to maintain its spending on its schools at least in the same amount as was provided in the preceding year. The City may only reduce its contribution to schools if overall City revenues decline. Roosevelt School District: In response to identified administrative and financial deficiencies in the Roosevelt School District, legislation was enacted in 2002 authorizing the Commissioner of Education to remove the Board of Education and replace it with an interim board. This interim board, under the oversight of the Commissioner, is charged with implementing a corrective action plan to improve both fiscal and academic performance in the district. This board will gradually transition to a locally elected board starting in 2007. In order to alleviate the financial problems faced by the district, the legislation also provided up to $6 million annually in special academic improvement grants to the Roosevelt School District, extended the payment of the existing $4 million State aid advance, authorized the issuance of bonds to address deficits in the district's general fund balance, and provided enhanced State assistance for construction of any new buildings deemed necessary. Stabilization Grants: In addition to the State aid formula amounts calculated for school districts, the May 2002 computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" and provided by the State Education Department in support of the 2002-03 enacted State budget includes $7.76 million in Stabilization Grant funds to 56 nonBig Five City school districts statewide.  27   SUMMARY OF 2002-03 SCHOOL YEAR/FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATIONS School Year/Fiscal Year Impact There are two time frames to consider when discussing 200203 New York State aid programs relating to support for public schools: the 2002-03 school year which runs from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003; and the 2002-03 State fiscal year which runs from April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003.

Each of the appendices is described below.  Appendix III-A summarizes the School Aid categories and adjustments enacted for 2002-03 and compares them with the 2001-02 aid categories. Appendix III-B provides the mathematical formulas for computing 25 different aids for 2002-03 school aid payments. Appendix III-C describes the pupil counts used in aid formulas. Appendix III-D describes the payment schedule for aids payable under section 3609 of the Education Law in the 2002-03 school year.       36   APPENDIX III-A COMPARISON OF 2001-02 AND 2002-03 GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROGRAMS Category COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING AID 2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Operating Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget. 2002-03 School Year No district will receive less that the Flex Aid amount allocated for each district in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget minus the 2000-01 school year amounts payable for Extraordinary Needs Aid, Minor Maintenance Aid, Public and Private Excess Cost Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid and Operating Standards Aid. Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio3 less than 1.000 will receive an additional one percent in Comprehensive Operating Aid. GROWTH AID4 A district's apportionment for 200102 Growth Aid was based on data on file with the commissioner of education for preparation of the 200102 Executive Budget Growth Index in excess of 1.004 * Formula Operating Aid5  3  A district's Combined Wealth Ratio for 2002-03 is equal to: (.5 x District Pupil Wealth Ratio) + (.5 x District Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio). The district Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: (1999 Actual Valuation)/2000-01 TWPU $264,200 ; and the Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: 1999 District Income/2000-01 TWPU $110,100 Beginning with the 1997-98 school year, income and actual valuation data moved back one year from the previous year-prior-to-the-base-year data. The Actual Valuation (AV) for calculating a district's property wealth per pupil for 1997-98 was 1994 AV. The income wealth per pupil calculation used the 1994 Adjusted Gross Income of district residents. For the 2002-03 school year, 1999 Actual Valuation and Adjusted Gross Income will be used. 4  For the 1997-98 school year and after the Growth Index is defined as a measure of enrollment rather than attendance.  37   Category EXTRAORDINARY NEEDS AID Formula Ceiling  2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Extraordinary Needs Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.  2002-03 School Year A minimum of 11% of the Formula Operating Aid ceiling. If more than 74.5% of a district's enrolled students have extraordinary needs, the district receives more than 11% of its Formula Operating Aid ceiling. The calculation for Formula Operating Aid is described in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law. Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio .60 100% of 2000-01 aid The sum of the percentage of eligible K-6 free and reduced price lunch applicants times 2001 enrollment, plus the number of Limited English Proficiency Students, plus a sparsity factor based on a calculation of enrollment per square mile times 2001 enrollment.  Wealth Measure State Share Save-Harmless Pupil Count  URBAN-SUBURBAN TRANSFER SUPPLEMENTATION  If formula operating aid per pupil is greater in the district of residence, the district of attendance will receive urban-suburban transfer aid equal to formula operating aid per pupil that the district of residence would have received.  Qualifying districts will receive the same aid that they would have received in the 2000-01 school year.  5  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid (as cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used.  38   Category GIFTED AND TALENTED AID Pupil Count Ceiling  2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Gifted and Talented Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.  2002-03 School Year  3% of ADA $196  LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AID Weighting  None Funding in lieu of 200102 Limited English Proficiency Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.

Starting with all new building projects approved by the voters beginning July 1, 2000, the selected building aid ratio is based upon the greater of a school district's current-year building aid ratio or the aid ratio selected for use in 1999-00 reduced by 10 percentage points. School districts with a pupil wealth ratio greater than 2.50 and an alternate pupil wealth ratio less than .850 may select an aid ratio equal to 1.263 multiplied by the district's Formula Operating Aid Ratio. Incentive: For aid payable in 1998-99 and after for new projects approved by the voters after 7/1/98 districts will continue to receive an additional 10 percent State reimbursement. However, the sum of the incentive and the selected aid ratio may Not exceed .950.

Section 3609-a includes computerized aids payable as General Support for Public Schools (GSPS) except for aids which are covered under the Section 3609-b (Excess Cost) payment schedule and Section 3609-d (BOCES Aid) payments as well as Textbook, Software and Library Materials aids. Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will not be paid until June 2003. Building Aid will be paid based on an assumed amortization for the 2002-03 aid year. Small Cities Aid is covered by Section 3609-c. In addition Section 3609-e of the Education Law governs the schedule of school district payments for School Tax Relief (STAR). This payment is intended to reimburse school districts for school property tax exemptions granted pursuant to Section 425 of the Real Property Tax Law. For GSPS aid payable in the 2002-03 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003. The payment schedule has several features: GSPS Aids   Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on or before September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November. AFixed@ payments will be paid in the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's apportionments, after TRS payments, will be paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent by October 15, 18.75 percent by November 15 and 25.00 percent by December 15. AIndividualized@ payments will be calculated for the months of January through June. January through May payments are based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. The June payment is based on data available to the Commissioner as of May 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 2003. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31.      66     Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year will be paid to school districts on or before March 31 on a prorata basis using the district=s relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total monies designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the total monies designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies designated for March (if a negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General Support of Public Schools will be used. Any aid payable for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. Building Aid will be paid based on an assumed amortization for the 2002-03 aid year. In addition the total of such aid payable through June for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid cannot exceed the total of such aid as it appears on the computer listing ""SA020-3."" Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003.      STAR Aid  STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies to the Commissioner of Education amounts payable under the STAR program and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements in the 2002-03 school year will follow the same accelerated formula as last year. Under the accelerated schedule, 35% of a district's school tax relief aid reimbursement will be paid in October and an additional 35% in November. Ten percent will be paid in December and the balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003. Payment amounts will be based on current data on file at the time of each payment through January. Current statutory provisions authorizing the Commissioner to withhold State aid payments from school districts that have not submitted enrollment and expenditure data on a timely basis shall not apply to STAR aid payments. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that occur after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003.         67   Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Reimbursement). Such State share monies will be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid Reimbursement. Any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids will be paid in accordance with the schedule below. Total Excess Cost Aids payable to a district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget.  The positive remainder of 25 percent of Excess Cost Aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November, 2002 will be paid on or before December 15. The positive remainder of 70 percent of such aids minus any apportionment previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-February 2003 will be paid on or before March 15. The positive remainder of 85 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-May 2003 will be paid on or before June 15. The positive remainder of 100 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-July 2003 will be paid on or before August 15. Any excess of actual Excess Cost Aids payable over the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003.          BOCES Aid  BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school districts of the BOCES, but the sum of all such payments are paid directly to the BOCES. Total BOCES Aid payable for the school year to each component school district may not exceed 100 percent of the amount of such aid as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget plus any BOCES Aid payable to contracting school districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts based on data on file at the time of each payment. BOCES obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will be paid by the State on behalf of the BOCES from the apportionment payable to the BOCES by the fifteenth of each of the months of September, October and November. An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on or before February 1 equal to 25 percent of the lesser of the actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" plus BOCES Aid payable for contracting school st      68   districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts, minus the payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf.  An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on the first business day of June equal to 55 percent of the lesser of the actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component school district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" plus BOCES Aid payable for contracting school districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts, minus the sum of all previous payments including payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf.

This unprecedented growth in State support to public schools includes the following components: C A $650 million school year. and secondary million. This State history. increase in computerized aids for the 1997-98 The total increase for all elementary, middle education programs is approximately $750 represents the largest funding increase in  C  A new STAR initiative that will provide homeowners across the State approximately $2.2 billion in direct property tax relief when fully implemented in 2001-02. A multi-year education investment that beginning in 1998-99 will support pre-kindergarten program expansion, full-day kindergarten incentive funding and a class size reduction initiative. In addition, school districts will be eligible in 1998-99 for enriched building aid support for new projects and minor maintenance aid. 1997-98 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS  C  A summary of the 1997-98 school aid programs contained in Chapter 436 of the Laws of 1997, as well as related programs contained in the Education, Labor and Social Services Budget (Chapter 53) of the Laws of 1997 and Chapter 389(STAR)are presented in this bulletin. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will increase the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools, BOCES Aid and Employment Preparation Education Aid by $679.31 million, from $10,271.89 million in 1996-97 to $10,951.20 million in the 199798 school year, an increase of 6.61 percent. Computerized aids will increase by $650.21 million or 6.71 percent. This is the largest enacted increase in State aid to public schools in history. The following major actions were taken: C Increased funding in the amount of $230.61 million is provided 1   for major operating aid programs subject to the transition adjustment to respond to growth in enrollment and increases in educational operating expenses. Of this amount, $91.18 million, or more than 39 percent will go to New York City. For 1997-98, no district will receive less than the previous year's sum of the aids subject to the transition adjustment. The transition adjustment will also allow districts to receive an increase in the sum of these aids over 1996-97 levels of up to 4.50 percent; or 17.60 percent of the amount withheld by the transition adjustment, whichever is greater. C An additional $16.39 million in State funding is available for textbooks and computer aids to be used to purchase new textbooks and to enhance the State's efforts to make computers accessible to students in every classroom. The General Fund portion of the Textbook Aid ceiling is increased to $25.00 for a total ceiling amount of $40.00. The Computer Software Aid ceiling is now $4.58 and that for Hardware Aid is $10.61. In the 1998-99 school year and after, these aids will also receive funding increases as a result of the multi-year STAR initiative highlighted below. Increased funding is provided to support services to students with special needs in regular classrooms. Additional State funding of $8.1 million is available for Educationally-Related Support Services Aid (ERSSA) and the declassification component of Public Excess Cost Aid is increased by $6 million to facilitate the transition of special needs students into regular classroom environments. Expense-based changes in building and transportation aids are provided under the same formulas used in 1996-97. Beginning in the 1998-99 school year the building aid formula will be enhanced to increase State support for school building projects and to recognize regional cost differences. Overall, for 1997-98 an additional $174.2 million is provided for building and transportation aids. The BOCES Aid limitation holding State support to 98 percent of present law has been eliminated. As a result, school districts will receive a $42.97 million BOCES Aid increase in 1997-98. $40 million is now available for prior year school aid claims, an increase of $18.2 million. $400,000 is now available for grants to school districts for school bus safety training purposes. 2  C  C  C  C C   COMPUTERIZED AIDS Major Operating Aids: As noted above, total State funding will be adjusted through a transition adjustment to ensure that no district receives less than its 1996-97 level for the major aids listed below. The transition adjustment will also allow districts to receive an increase in the sum of these aids over 1996-97 levels of up to 4.50 percent or 17.60 percent of the amount withheld by the transition adjustment, whichever is greater. Aids subject to the transition adjustment include:      Operating Aid Tax Effort Aid Tax Equalization Aid Gifted and Talented Aid Limited English Proficiency Aid  For the 1997-98 school year, aid provided to school districts under these programs totals $5,906.04 million, an increase of $230.61 million. Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of at-risk pupils. A recalculation of the formula's concentration factor will provide $544.52 million to school districts, an increase of $84.46 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula which supports school district programs for special needs students continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the selected Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum. The second uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the extraordinary needs percent in excess of 60 percent and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The aid ceiling for the first per-pupil calculation continues to be $331.52; that for the second has been increased to $450.00. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 8 percent; that for the second has been increased to 12 percent (from 7 percent). For 1997-98, this aid will total $48.33 million, an increase of $8.13 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: This program supports the commitment to a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for pupils with disabilities. For aids payable in 199798, the calculation of public excess cost aid will be based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 1995-96 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $6,100. The aid ratio will be 3   determined using the combined wealth ratio, as used for operating aid, and based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. The saveharmless provision is continued. Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for public excess cost aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid now equals 50 percent of the public excess cost aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Public Excess Cost Aid will total $1,466.93 million in 1997-98, an increase of $88.41 million. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs offered by private schools and in the Stateoperated Rome and Batavia schools. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 1997-98 will total $117.98 million, an increase of $6.67 million. BOCES million. percent of districts Aid: For 1997-98, BOCES aid will total $368.47 The BOCES aid limitation holding State aid to 98 present law has been eliminated. As a result, school will receive a BOCES aid increase of $42.97 million.  Special Services Aid: This aid, which totals $139.68 million for 1997-98, an increase of $13.72 million, is provided to the Big Five city school districts for career education and computer services. Since these five districts are not permitted to join BOCES, a different formula is used to fund career education programs and computer services provided by such districts. The career education aid ceiling for 1997-98 is increased from 1996-97 and is set at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. Previously, the maximum expense had been $57.10. Transportation Aid: The minimum aid ratio for transportation aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, this aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved expenses). Transportation aid will total $713.10 million in 1997-98 an increase of $25.40 million. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred 4   only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year. Building Aid (BANS/New Debt Service): For 1997-98 building aid, a district may choose the highest of its current aid ratio or the aid ratio used for aid payable in the 1981-82 through 1996-97 school years (i.e., aid ratios based on current year or prior year selected actual valuations per resident pupil-AV/RWADA or the AV/RWADA for 1979-80 through 1994-95). For the 1997-98 school year and after, the 95 percent cap on aidable expenses pending submission of final cost reports has been eliminated. In addition, statutory provisions governing energy performance contracts have been clarified to exclude State building aid from the energy savings calculation and limit the payback period to 18 years. All building projects approved by the voters after July 1, 1998 will receive a 10 percent addition to their selected State aid ratio. Additionally, the minimum aid ratio will be 10 percent. A regional cost factor will help address the higher cost of building and repairing school facilities in certain areas of the State. These building aid enhancements will give school districts $28 million more in building aid reimbursements in 1998-99 and are expected to reach $170 million by 2001-02. As was the case last year, aid for bond anticipation notes (BANs) and for newly issued bonds and capital notes will be based on data reported to the Commissioner on or before November 15 or the actual claim submitted by the district on or before March 1. For 1997-98, building aid will total $775.36 million, an increase of $148.80 million. Reorganization Aid: Reorganization incentive aid is provided for both operating and building expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law. It is paid as a supplement to regular operating and building aid when districts meet certain conditions prescribed by law. The statutory provisions for reorganization incentive aid remain unchanged for districts which have already undergone reorganization. Beginning in 1992, reorganization incentive operating aid for reorganizing districts was increased to 40 percent. Eligibility for reorganization incentive building aid on new projects for qualified districts was extended to July 1, 1998 in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996. In total, reorganization incentive aid will amount to $40.78 million in 1997-98, an increase of $2.79 million. 5   Growth Aid: Growth aid to qualifying districts will be paid as a separate apportionment in June 1998. As provided for in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996, beginning with aid for the 199798 school year, a district's growth index is calculated based on change in enrollment rather than average daily attendance. For 1997-98, growth aid will total $58.41 million, a decrease of $18.40 million. Textbook and Computer Aids: As noted previously, as part of the overall enacted budget, multi-year funding increases are provided for textbooks and computer aids. For the 1997-98 school year, the following provisions apply: C Textbook Aid: The lottery funded portion of textbook aid is $15 per pupil. The general fund portion has been increased from $21 to $25 per pupil, for a maximum total textbook aid payment of $40 per pupil. This aid will total $127.41 million in 1997-98, an increase of $12.71 million. The aid ceiling will continue to increase to $78.18 by 2001-02, resulting in a doubling of textbook aid. Computer Software Aid: Under this program, aid is apportioned to districts for the purchase and loan of computer software. Software programs designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils pursuant to Rules of the Board of Regents. Beginning with the 1997-98 school year, districts will be reimbursed for expenses up to $4.58 per pupil for 1996-97 pupils enrolled in both public and nonpublic schools. (By 2001-02 the aid ceiling will increase to $23.90.) For 1997-98, computer software aid will total $11.03 million, an increase of $1.09 million. Computer Hardware and Technology Aid: This aid category, which is no longer subject to the transition adjustment, provides funding for the lease or purchase of mini- and microcomputers, computer terminals or technology equipment for instructional purposes. Computer hardware aid equals approved expense (up to $10.61), adjusted by the current year AV/RWADA aid ratio, per pupil. For the 1997-98 school year, $13.36 million, an increase of $2.59 million, is provided in the enacted budget. Between 1997-98 and 2001-02 the formula aid ceiling will increase to $32.35, a four-fold increase over the 1996-97 ceiling of $8.00 per pupil.  C  C  Library Materials Aid: Districts are reimbursed for expenses up to $4.00 per pupil for 1996-97 pupils enrolled in 6   public and nonpublic schools. For 1997-98, library materials aid will total $12.42 million. Materials purchased under this program and designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils. NONCOMPUTERIZED AIDS Teacher Support Aid: A total of $67.48 million is provided in aid and grants to the Big Five City School Districts. This amount includes an increase of $10 million to New York City. Aid to Small City School Districts: Aid for small city school districts was instituted as a grant program by Chapter 288 of the Laws of 1979, and was intended to provide funds to districts at or near constitutional tax limits. With the removal of small city constitutional tax limits by a referendum in 1985, aid to small city school districts is provided to permit such districts to adjust their taxes gradually to an appropriate level. A total of $81.87 million, the same amount as in 1996-97, will be allocated to small city school districts for the 1997-98 school year. Employment Preparation Education (EPE) Aid: EPE funding available for adult education programs such as literacy, basic skills and high school equivalency programs. School districts and BOCES offering such programs are required to submit plans service to the Commissioner of Education for approval. Total for the 1997-98 school year continues to be capped at $96.18 million, and approved claims above such amount will be subject proration. is of aid to  Urban-Suburban Transfer: A total of $1.13 million will be provided in 1997-98 to districts that participate in a voluntary interdistrict transfer between an urban and suburban school district to reduce racial isolation. Related transportation expenses are eligible for transportation aid. Education of Homeless Children: Chapter 348 of the Laws of 1988, by amending section 3602 of the Education Law, instituted this program of State aid. Under this program, school districts where homeless children are temporarily located are reimbursed for the direct cost of educating such children. This cost to the State is partially recaptured from the district of last attendance for each such homeless child by deducting an amount equal to the district's basic contribution per pupil from the district's State aid. The net cost of aid for homeless pupils in 1997-98 is estimated at $4.0 million.  7   Aid for Incarcerated Youth: A total of $10.5 million is provided to continue support for the provision of educational services to youth detained in local correctional facilities. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 53 of the Laws of 1992, such services may now be provided, and aided, during summer sessions as well as the regular school year. Reorganization Study Grants: In addition to regular reorganization aid, the Commissioner of Education is empowered to provide reorganization study grants of up to $50,000 to encourage school districts to study the feasibility of combining with adjacent districts. In addition, $20,000 grants may be provided for the study of collaborative delivery systems, and training therefor, for school-age, at-risk youth. Such grants are also available for administrative and operational reviews of individual school districts. A total of $1.28 million is provided for such grants in 1997-98. State Bilingual Categorical Funds: In 1997-98, $11.20 million will be used to continue existing funding of regional bilingual programs at BOCES and to support innovative Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs which employ two languages (one of which is English) for the purpose of instruction, involving students whose native language is other than English. Categorical Reading Aid: This aid category is provided to the Big Five city school districts to help improve pupil reading skills and academic performance. Aid payments will total $63.95 million in 1997-98, the same amount as last year, to be distributed as follows:      New York City Buffalo Syracuse Rochester Yonkers $29.95 17.50 6.00 5.50 5.00 million million million million million  AI/DP Grants: $949,900 is available in 1997-98, for attendance improvement and drop-out prevention programs.

Pre-kindergarten Programs: Pre-kindergarten programs provide health, psychological and social services to four-yearold children from economically deprived neighborhoods. A total of $50.2 million has been budgeted for the 1997-98 school year. Grants to support existing programs will be awarded based on Regulations of the Commissioner subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget. Beginning in the 1998-99 school year, an additional $50 million will be made available for this program as the first phase of a multi-year STAR initiative discussed below. Lunch/Breakfast Programs: $31.7 million in State funds, the same as last year, including support for additional expenses of school breakfast programs for schools with extraordinary needs, is appropriated to subsidize school lunch and school breakfast programs.

STAR Property Tax Relief  Chapter 389 of the Laws of 1997 includes a multi-year School TAx Relief (STAR) program that will provide approximately $2.2 billion by 2001-02 to reimburse school districts for Stateauthorized property tax relief for homeowners. When fully implemented, the property tax component of the STAR program will provide homeowners with at least a $30,000 exemption from the full value of their primary residence for school property tax purposes. Senior homeowners at least 65 years old and with incomes up to $60,000 will receive exemptions of at least $50,000 from the full value of their primary residences for school tax purposes. The State will reimburse school districts dollar-fordollar for the property tax revenues foregone from these exemptions. STAR property tax exemptions will be phased-in, beginning with a $12,500 exemption for income-eligible senior homeowners for 1998-99 school year taxes. Senior exemptions will be increased to $25,000 in 1999-2000, $37,500 in 2000-01 and $50,000 in 2001-02. Other homeowners will be eligible for exemptions of: $10,000 in 1999-2000; $20,000 in 2000-01; and $30,000 in 2001-02. In those counties where the median value of homes exceeds the statewide median home value, as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS), the value of the exemptions will be increased. A ""Property Taxpayer's Bill of Rights"" included in Chapter 389 provides that property tax bills include additional information, including the estimated full value of the property and the uniform percentage of value at which a municipality is assessing properties. Information on how to appeal assessments must be provided with the bill or through another notice. While local assessors will process applications for STAR property tax exemptions, school districts are required to notify residential property owners that they may qualify for such relief and must apply to their local assessor by the applicable taxable status date to receive the exemption. STAR exemptions will have no levies, rates or other State aid. reimbursed for the taxes foregone Office of Real Property Services.

Upon defeat of a school budget by voters, contingency budget increases will be capped at the lesser of 4 percent or 120 percent of the CPI. Districts adopting a contingency budget must also limit their administrative component to a percentage of the budget that is the lower of the previous year's percentage or that for the first rejected budget.

The 1997-98 budget enacts a multi-year commitment of State aid to expand pre-kindergarten programs, to reduce class sizes to foster an improved learning environment for children, and to preserve and expand school facilities. In addition, education programs are strengthened by providing additional funding for textbooks, computers and other educational technology. Major initiatives which will begin in the 1998-99 school year include: C A $50 million increase in aid for pre-kindergarten programs for four-year-old children ($500 million when fully implemented in 2001-02). A minimum of $2,000 and a maximum of $4,000 is provided for each pre-school child in a school district, based on wealth. Districts would be required to develop a plan in conjunction with local child-care agencies and pre-schools for providing pre-school education.  17   Provision of services would be a local option and not a mandate. C An estimated $28 million enhancement of the building aid formula to reflect regional costs and to support a State building aid enrichment that would add 10 percent to each school district's aid ratio up to a maximum of 95 percent ($170 million by 2001-02). The minimum aid ratio will be 10 percent. In addition, $50 million will be available for minor maintenance projects ($80 million by 2001-02). Textbooks and computer aids will receive $3 million in additional State funding in 1998-99, an amount which will increase to $120 million by 2001-02. By 2001-02 the computer hardware per pupil aid ceiling will increase fourfold over that for 1996-97; the computer software per pupil aid ceiling will increase five-fold. Furthermore, districts will be allowed to purchase computers through vendors and receive aid equivalent to BOCES aid. Big 5 city schools and other non-component districts will also receive aid on computer purchases at an aid ratio equivalent to BOCES aid, up to the amount appropriated statewide. Funding for education technology will expand by $9 million in 1998-99 and by an additional $91 million when fully implemented. An additional $1.5 million will be provided for instructional staff development grants ($10.0 million by 2000-01). In addition, the Big 5 city school districts will be able to contract for professional development through BOCES, on their own, or in collaboration with higher education institutions. Such expenses will be eligible for aid at a BOCES aid ratio, up to the amount appropriated statewide. Additional State aid, on a per pupil basis, will be provided to districts that decide to establish full-day kindergarten programs during the next five years.  C  C  C  C  Beginning in the 1999-2000 school year, $75 million in additional State aid will be available for reducing class sizes. This aid will increase to $225 million by 2001-02. The enacted budget also establishes a new $25 million Tax Freeze program that will provide State aid to those districts that voluntarily freeze or reduce their property taxes beginning with the 1999-2000 school year. 18   OTHER INITIATIVES There are several components of the 1997-98 enacted budget which will effect BOCES: C For the 1997-98 school year and after, all BOCES must develop a report card highlighting the fiscal and academic performance of the BOCES and its component schools plus comparing these measures to a statewide average for all BOCES.

C  C  Each BOCES must make public information regarding the total salary of its district superintendent including health insurance, travel expenses and other items. The Commissioner of Education will conduct a study of the services now provided to school districts by BOCES and will develop recommendations for reforming the approval process for new and existing services.  C  Chapter 436 of the Laws of 1997 also includes a number of provisions affecting special education by: C Requiring SED, in consultation with Advisory Panel for Special Education recommendations to the Governor and December 1, 1998 concerning ways to placements to special education; Extending 1997 which number of education for one provide disabled classes; the Commissioner's and others, to make the Legislature by reduce inappropriate  C  year provisions of law set to expire in school districts with flexibility in the students who may be enrolled in special and  C  Directing SED to require districts with rates of referral to special education which are significantly higher than the statewide average, with significant documented problems or which over-rely on restrictive placements, to submit an explanation for each identified issue.  19   II SUMMARY OF 1997-98 SCHOOL YEAR/FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATIONS School Year/Fiscal Year Impact There are two time frames to consider when discussing 199798 New York State aid programs relating to support for public schools: the 1997-98 school year which runs from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998; and the 1997-98 State fiscal year which runs from April 1, 1997 through March 31, 1998.

There are 78 districts that are projected to have losses of $24.13 million. The combined total of increases and losses produce a net increase statewide of $650.20 million, or 6.71 percent.  Table II-D lists the aid amounts allocated to each of the Big Five city school districts under 23 selected General Support programs. The aids analyzed are those shown in Table II-A. The table shows that Yonkers had the largest percentage increase (8.97 percent) of the Big Five cities. Table II-E lists changes in all General Support individual aid categories for New York City. The net increase for all aids is 7.43 percent. In Table II-F, 20 major 1997-98 aid categories have been combined to show the overall impact upon school districts in the State's 18 most populous counties, New York City, and the rest of the State. The State average increase for these aids will be 6.71 percent. The 371 districts in the 18 most populous counties contain 46.81 percent of the State's public school pupils. These districts will receive 43.61 percent of the 1997-98 combined aids total. Districts in the 18 most populous counties will have an average combined aids increase of 6.78 percent. Districts in the rest of the State, exclusive of New York City, will have an average increase of 5.44 percent and will receive 21.25 percent of the 1997-98 combined aids total.      25   TABLE II-D SUMMARY OF SELECTED AIDS TO THE BIG FIVE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCED THROUGH GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS APPROPRIATIONS: 1996-97 AND 1997-98 New York City Buffalo Rochester Syracuse Yonkers 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 (---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amounts in Millions ---------------------------------------------------------------------------) $2,044.32 $2,080.06 $132.21 $131.68 $97.14 $99.75 $67.04 $68.01 $29.48 $31.62 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 34.10 49.69 14.96 26.69 8.13 12.28 0.00 0.00 5.20 5.28 0.24 0.24 0.18 0.19 0.12 0.12 0.11 0.12 48.41 57.73 1.34 1.38 1.24 1.27 0.57 0.55 0.99 1.03 (71.58) (25.53) (19.64) (28.07) (33.57) (39.51) (14.02) (15.75) (19.98) (18.28) $2,026.36 $2,117.54 $148.25 $154.92 $79.95 $88.39 $61.84 $65.21 $10.60 $14.49 284.83 4.40 55.79 16.43 488.57 103.54 179.46 182.73 41.38 $3,383.49 352.74 5.93 62.54 23.20 546.56 114.50 167.41 210.12 33.16 $3,633.69 $250.20 7.39% 15.17 0.28 2.47 1.06 39.86 8.87 20.64 1.79 0.00 $238.39 17.25 0.37 2.65 1.35 41.98 10.08 22.14 2.52 0.00 $253.26 $14.87 6.24% 12.52 0.20 1.82 0.81 37.46 5.11 21.18 15.08 1.55 $175.68 16.24 0.28 2.11 1.13 39.07 5.82 20.69 16.61 0.40 $190.74 $15.06 8.57% 5.89 0.14 0.83 0.51 22.18 5.85 8.93 8.08 1.34 $115.59 6.51 0.19 1.16 0.62 24.00 5.85 8.39 7.13 1.90 $120.96 $5.37 4.65% 4.86 0.06 1.27 0.25 12.18 2.60 4.88 1.26 1.00 $38.96 6.13 0.04 1.48 0.36 13.32 3.43 5.15 1.49 0.60 $46.49 $7.53 19.33%  AID CATEGORY I.

EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION EDUCATION (EPE) AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 24 Districts are eligible for EPE aid for the attendance of pupils age 21 or older who have not received a high school diploma or equivalency diploma. Beginning in 1991-92, aid paid directly to BOCES for approved BOCES EPE programs is based on component districts' aid ratios. Beginning in 1995-96, the BOCES EPE aid ratio is based on the aggregate actual valuation and TWPU of the component districts of the BOCES. Adults can register with BOCES for participation at a BOCES site. Beginning in 1996-97, the BOCES EPE aid ratio is the greater of the EPE aid ratio based on the aggregate wealth of the component districts or 85 percent of the highest EPE aid ratio of a component district of the BOCES. EPE Aid = $6.10 x EPE Aid Ratio x EPE Hours EPE Aid Ratio = 1 - (Pupil Wealth Ratio x .40) Minimum: .400 1994 Actual Valuation/TWPU State Average Full Value/TWPU ($251,100)  Pupil Wealth Ratio =  EPE Hours = Total hours of instruction for all students in EPE programs between July 1 and June 30 of the current year. EPE aid will be reduced if it and other State and Federal sources of aid for EPE programs exceed the entire cost of such program in that year. For the 1997-98 school year, total aid is limited to $96.18 million. INCARCERATED YOUTH AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 35 All districts are eligible for incarcerated youth aid.

Average Daily Attendance/Average Daily Membershipa A. Average Daily Attendance (ADA) is the average number of pupils present on each regular school day in a given period, such average is determined by dividing the total number of attendance days of all pupils by the number of days school was in session. Average Daily Membership (ADM) is a measure of enrollment. It is the total possible aggregate daily attendance of all pupils in the district divided by the days of session.  B.  II.

Section 3609-a includes all computerized aids except Textbook, Software, and Library Materials aids and Excess Cost aids which are covered under the section 3609-b payment schedule (which also includes Medicaid payments). Growth Aid and Building Aid for new debt service and BANS are not paid until June, 1998. Small Cities Aid for 1997-98 is covered by section 3609c and BOCES Aid for 1997-98 by section 3609-d. As was the case last year, for the 1997-98 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 State Aid to Localities Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998. The payment schedule has several features: General Aids C C Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November. ""Fixed"" payments will be paid in the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's apportionments, after TRS payments, will be paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent by October 15, 18.75 percent by November 15 and 25.00 percent by December 15. ""Individualized"" payments will be calculated for the months of January through June, based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 1998. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31. Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year will be paid to school districts on March 31 on a prorata basis using the district's relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total monies designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the total monies designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies designated for March (if a negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General Support of Public Schools will be used. Any aids payable for new debt service and bond anticipation notes (BANS) or for Growth Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. However, for  C  C  C  C  52   new debt service or bond anticipation notes (BANS), if the actual claim is submitted by March 1 then the district will receive the lesser of the aid based on 11/15/97 data or the actual claim submitted on or before 3/1/98. In addition, such aid payable through June cannot exceed the aid for new debt service or BANS as it appears on computer listing ""SA9798"". C Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998.  Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Reimbursement). Such State share monies will be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid Reimbursement. Any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids will be paid in accordance with the schedule below. Total Excess Cost Aids payable to a district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 Aid to Localities Budget. C The positive remainder of 25 percent of Excess Cost Aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November, 1997 will be paid on December 15. The positive remainder of 70 percent of such aids minus any apportionment previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-February 1998 will be paid on March 15. The positive remainder of 85 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-May 1998 will be paid on June 15. The positive remainder of 100 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-July 1998 will be paid on August 15. Any excess of actual Excess Cost Aids payable over the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9697,"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998.  C  C  C  C  BOCES Aida C BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school district of the BOCES, but the sum of all such payments are paid directly to the BOCES. Total BOCES Aid payable for the school year to each component school district may not exceed 100 percent of the amount of such aid as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 Aid to Localities Budget. BOCES obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will be paid by the State on behalf of the BOCES from the apportionment payable to the BOCES by the fifteenth of each of the months of September, October and November. By February 1 an additional payment will be made to BOCES equal to 25 percent of the total BOCES Aid payable for the school year less the payments made to TRS on the BOCES' behalf. BOCES Aid for special act, less-than-eight teacher, and special contracting districts will be added to the ""SA9798"" amounts. a  C  C  53   C  An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on the first business day of June equal to 55 percent of the lesser of actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component school district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798,"" minus the sum of all previous payments including payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf. Any remaining apportionment payable to the BOCES, including any excess of actual BOCES Aid payable over the amount of such aid reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" will be paid to the BOCES on the first business day of September, 1998.  C  Aid to Small City School Districts Payments to small city school districts will be made pursuant to Section 3609-c of the Education Law.

For the 2003-04 school year, funding for General Support for Public Schools will be reduced by $185.84 million, or 1.27 percent, from $14,615.60 million to $14,429.76 million. Major elements of State support for elementary and secondary education include the following:  An overall decrease of $185.84 million (1.27 percent) in school aid, including a decrease of $206.80 million (1.48 percent)in formula-based computerized aids. A new Comprehensive Operating Aid totalling $6,840.78 million which will replace four previous aid categories and which incorporates a reduction of $285.35 million, or 4.00 percent. A $18.63 million, or 2.71 percent, increase to a total of $704.91 million in funding for Extraordinary Needs Aid for districts with concentrations of at-risk pupils. An increase of $42.95 million (1.88 percent) to a total of $2,332.94 million for Public and Private Excess Cost Aid funding for programs for pupils with disabilities. To promote the education of disabled children with their non-disabled peers, and to generate additional aid for such children, a pupil weighting of 0.5 continues to be added to the existing public excess cost aid weighting for severely disabled children. These are children who require special education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive such services in a general education setting. Funding of $201.04 million is provided for Universal Prekindergarten Aid and funding of $136.40 million is          1   available for Class Size Reduction Aid.1 Minor Maintenance Aid is continued at $49.97 million. An allocation of $5.64 million is provided for Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive Aid, reflecting a decrease of $11.56 million due to a decline in new incentive grant applications from school districts.  Building Aid funding of $1,168.69 million, a decrease of $115.20 million. This funding level reflects full implementation of recent reforms whereby the State will reimburse its share of school construction projects over the useful life of the project. Reforms will also authorize 2003-04 Building Aid payments for projects for which a construction contract has been signed and notification received by the State Education Department by February 15, 2003. Projects for which notification is received by the State Education Department after such date are eligible for Building Aid in 2004-05. A total of $264.13 million, an increase of $0.34 million, is provided for expense-based instructional materials aids including the textbook, software and hardware aid categories. Computer Software Aid is increased by $0.47 million or 1.03 percent. Textbook Aid will decrease by $0.83 million or 0.44 percent. Computer Hardware Aid is increased by $0.70 million or 2.53 percent. An increase of $93.37 million, for a total of $1,093.37 million, is provided for expense-based Transportation Aid. Statewide, up to $5.00 million continues to be available for reimbursement of summer school transportation expenses. A total of $35.82 million, a decrease of $5.34 million (12.97 percent), is available to fund school district summer programs to improve student performance in required academic subjects or to prepare for Regents examinations. Aid for BOCES services will total $522.02 million, an increase of $27.45 million or 5.55 percent.          1  Legislation enacted with the 2003-04 State Budget provides for program totals of up to $204.68 million for Universal Prekindergarten Aid and up to $139.97 million for Class Size Reduction Aid.  2     For the 2003-04 school year, $122.16 million will be available for Special Services Aid for career education programs and school computer services. This aid is provided to both Big Five City school districts and other districts that are non-components of BOCES. Formula revisions will enhance funding for Limited English Proficiency Aid ($86.49 million) and for Tax Limitation Aid ($29.96 million). Continued General Support for Public School funding at 2002-03 levels is provided for various categorical aid programs including Teacher Support Aid ($67.48 million), Small Cities Aid ($81.88 million) and Bilingual Grants ($11.20 million). The Teacher-Mentor Intern program will be funded at $4.00 million, a decrease of $1.00 million, while Teacher Centers will be funded at a level of up to $31.00 million. The ""Teachers of Tomorrow"" initiative will be funded at $20.00 million, a decrease of $5.00 million. This program provides assistance to school districts, including the Big Five City schools, in their efforts to increase the supply of qualified entry-level teachers and to improve teacher retention. The 2003-04 State Budget provides funding of $90.00 million, an increase of $33.00 million, for payment of statewide prior year claims and/or fiscal stabilization grants. This includes up to $62.00 million for payment to New York City. STAR property tax relief will increase by $136 million, from $2.12 billion in 2002-03 to an estimated $2.26 billion in 2003-04, to support the $50,000 full value exemption for income-eligible seniors and the $30,000 full value exemption for other homeowners. Enacted in the 2002-03 budget, the STAR cost of living adjustment (COLA) for senior income eligibility will raise the income ceiling from $60,000 to $62,100. This COLA will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income will not make seniors who              3   receive enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. In addition, legislation was enacted which provides seniors with the option of having their income eligibility for the enhanced STAR benefit verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Seniors who elect the income verification option as part of their application for the 2003-04 school year will not have to reapply for the exemption in the following years. They will be automatically renewed as long as their income eligibility and homeowner status remain unchanged.  2003-04 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS Most major formula provisions remain unchanged for the 2003-04 school year. However, the enacted Budget does include changes in Comprehensive Operating Aid, Extraordinary Needs Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Tax Limitation Aid and Building Aid. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will decrease the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools (GSPS) by $185.84 million, from $14,615.60 million in 2002-03 to $14,429.76 million in the 2003-04 school year, a reduction of 1.27 percent. Formula-based computerized aids will decrease by $206.80 million, or 1.48 percent, to $13,800.73 million. FORMULA-BASED AIDS Comprehensive Operating Aid: For 2003-04, school districts statewide will receive $6,840.78 million in new Comprehensive Operating Aid  a decrease of $285.35 million, or 4.00 percent. The Comprehensive Operating Aid category now consolidates four 2002-03 aids into a single funding source. The combined aid replaces Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid. For 2003-04, school district aid totals also incorporate a wealth- and pupilbased formula reduction which will affect all districts, however, low wealth districts and districts with a high proportion of at-risk pupils will experience a lesser reduction.  4   Comprehensive Operating Aid decreases will be allocated based on the following two-step calculation:  Aid provided to each district will be reduced by an amount equal to 1.75 percent of its 2002-03 total for the four consolidated aid categories noted above. An additional reduction amount will be calculated using free and reduced price lunch and school district combined wealth data. The higher the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch programs and the lower the per pupil income and property wealth of the district, the smaller the amount of the district's additional reduction. The combined reduction for districts will range from 2.25 percent to 6.30 percent of their 2002-03 aid total for Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid.      Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of limited English proficient and other at-risk pupils. For the 2003-04 school year, the formula includes a recalculation of the concentration factor which provides additional aid to districts with more than 74.5 percent of their students identified as at-risk pupils. The save-harmless provision is continued and guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2002-03. Extraordinary Needs Aid will provide $704.91 million to school districts, an increase of $18.63 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: Public Excess Cost Aid will total $2,152.46 million in 2003-04, an increase of $35.81 million. This program supports the additional costs of providing a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for students with disabilities. Aid payable in 2003-04 will be calculated based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 2001-02 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $7,650. The aid ratio is determined using the Combined Wealth Ratio and is based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. For 2003-04, the public excess cost pupil weightings continue to contain a 0.5 weighting for those children who required special education services in the year prior to the base year at least 60 percent of the time and who received these 5   services in a general education setting. The pupil weighting for students requiring special education services more than 60 percent of the day in the base year will be 1.65 for aid paid in 2003-04. The save-harmless provision ensures that no district will receive less than 95 percent of the aid amount paid for 2002-03. (Integrated settings aid is not subject to the Public Excess Cost Aid save-harmless calculation.) Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for Public Excess Cost Aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid equals 50 percent of a district's Public Excess Cost Aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs serving public school children placed in private school settings and in the State-operated schools in Rome and Batavia. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 2003-04 will total $180.48 million, an increase of $7.14 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula supports school district programs for students at risk of requiring special education services. It continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses a $365.00 aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the formula Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum2. The second uses a $635.00 aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the Extraordinary Needs percent (to the extent that the percentage of students with Extraordinary Needs is in excess of 60 percent) and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 9 percent; that for the second is 15 percent. For 2003-04, this aid will total $72.48 million, an increase of $2.11 million. BOCES Aid: For 2003-04, aid to reimburse districts for expenditures for BOCES services in the 2002-03 school year will total $522.02 million, an increase of $27.45 million. The use of BOCES in the provision of Academic Intervention Services (AIS) 2  Formula Operating Aid components (as described in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Educationally Related Support Services Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid and Growth Aid.  6   to improve student performance must continue to be approved by the State Education Department to be aid eligible. Districts must demonstrate, not only that district resources were insufficient to provide appropriate Academic Intervention Services, but that accessing BOCES services is a cost-effective solution. Special Services Aid: Special Services Aid funds career education programs and computer services for school districts which are not components of a BOCES. The career education aid ceiling for 2003-04 is continued at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. For 200304, this aid will total $122.16 million, a decrease of $4.83 million. Transportation Aid: Transportation Aid will total $1,093.37 million in 2003-04, an increase of $93.37 million. The minimum aid ratio for Transportation Aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved transportation expenses). The aid ratio choice permitting school districts to receive aid based on public and non-public enrollments is continued and will benefit districts transporting large numbers of nonpublic school students. District expenditures for transportation to and from school district operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5.00 million statewide. Districts may claim aid based on the transportation of pupils in summer school courses to improve performance during the summer of 2002. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year.

There are 251 districts that are projected to have increases of $101.99 million. The combined total of increases and reductions produce a net decrease statewide of $206.80 million, or 1.48 percent.  Table II-C lists the aid amounts allocated to each of the Big Five city school districts under selected General Support programs. The aids analyzed are those shown in Table II-A. Table II-D lists changes in all General Support individual aid categories for New York City. The net decrease for all aids is 1.01 percent. In Table II-E, major 2003-04 aid categories have been combined to show the overall impact upon school districts in the State's 18 most populous counties, New York City, and the rest of the State. The State average decrease for these aids will be 1.48 percent. The 371 districts in the 18 most populous counties contain 48.36 percent of the State's public school pupils. These districts will receive 43.30 percent of the 2003-04 combined aids total. Districts in the 18 most populous counties will have an average decrease in combined aids of 1.30 percent. Districts in the rest of the State, exclusive of New York City, will have an average decrease of 1.91 percent and will receive 19.62 percent of the 2003-04 combined aids total.      25   TABLE II-C SUMMARY OF SELECTED AIDS TO THE BIG FIVE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCED THROUGH GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS APPROPRIATIONS: 2002-03 AND 2003-04 New York City AID CATEGORY I.

Each of the appendices is described below.  Appendix III-A summarizes the School Aid categories and adjustments enacted for 2003-04 and compares them with the 2002-03 aid categories. Appendix III-B provides the mathematical formulas for computing 23 different aids for 2003-04 school aid payments. Appendix III-C describes the pupil counts used in aid formulas. Appendix III-D describes the payment schedule for aids payable under section 3609 of the Education Law in the 2003-04 school year.       29   APPENDIX III-A COMPARISON OF 2002-03 AND 2003-04 GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROGRAMS Category COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING AID 2002-03 School Year No district will receive less that the Flex Aid amount allocated for each district in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget minus the 2000-01 school year amounts payable for Extraordinary Needs Aid, Minor Maintenance Aid, Public and Private Excess Cost Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid and Operating Standards Aid. Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR)5 less than 1.000 will receive an additional one percent in Comprehensive Operating Aid. 2003-04 School Year School districts statewide will receive aid equal to the 2002-03 sum of Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid minus a reduction calculation described below. Each district will be assessed a reduction amount equal to 1.75 percent of its 2002-03 total for the 4 aid categories noted above. All districts will be assessed an additional reduction amount calculated using Free and Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) data and the school district's Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR).

The assumed amortization is based on approved project costs, the term of borrowing and an assumed interest rate. New projects subject to prospective assumed amortization are those that were either approved by the Commissioner of Education on or after December 1, 2001, or, for which debt (bonds, BANs, and capital notes) is first issued on or after such date. Each project is assigned a useful life, cost allowance and assumed interest rate. The State share of financing costs associated with refinancings are reimbursed in full to districts. In addition, districts are reimbursed for lease expenses and on a one year lag for costs of exceptional expenses including metal detectors, condition surveys, and capital outlay exception. Selected Aid Ratio: Districts may use the higher of the current year aid ratio or the aid ratio computed for use in any year commencing with the 1981-82 school year. Starting with all new building projects approved by the voters after July 1, 2000, the selected building aid ratio is based upon the greater of a school district's current-year building aid ratio or the aid ratio selected for use in 1999-00 reduced by 10 percentage points. School districts with a pupil wealth ratio greater than 2.50 and an alternate pupil wealth ratio less than .850 may select an aid ratio equal to 1.263 multiplied by the district's Formula Operating Aid Ratio. Incentive: For aid payable in 1998-99 and after for new projects approved by the voters after 7/1/98, districts will continue to receive an additional 10 percent State reimbursement. However, the sum of the incentive and the selected aid ratio may not exceed .950. In addition, cost allowances on all contracts awarded after 7/1/98 will be adjusted to reflect regional costs for school districts in high cost areas of the State.

Since 1991-92, aid paid directly to BOCES for approved BOCES EPE programs has been based on component districts' aid ratios. Beginning in 1995-96, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been based on the aggregate actual valuation and TWPU of the component districts of the BOCES. Adults can register with BOCES for participation at a BOCES site. Since 1996-97, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been the greater of the EPE aid ratio based on the aggregate wealth of the component districts or 85 percent of the highest EPE aid ratio of a component district of the BOCES. EPE Aid = $7.65 x EPE Aid Ratio x EPE Hours EPE Aid Ratio = 1  (Pupil Wealth Ratio x .40) Minimum: .400  51   Pupil Wealth Ratio = 2000 Actual Valuation/2001-02 TWPU State Average ($281,000) EPE Hours = Total hours of instruction for all students in EPE programs between July 1 and June 30 of the current year.

For GSPS aid payable in the 2003-04 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA030-4,"" which was released in April 2003 with the issuance of the 2003-04 Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 2004. The payment schedule has several features: GSPS Aids   Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on or before September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November.

""Individualized"" payments will be calculated for the months of January through June. January through May payments are based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. The June payment is based on data available to the Commissioner as of May 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 2004.

Any aid payable for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. In addition the total of such aid payable through June for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid cannot exceed the total of such aid as it appears on the computer listing ""SA030-4."" Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA030-4"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2004.      STAR Aid  STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies amounts payable under the STAR program to the Commissioner of Education and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements commencing in the 2003-04 school year are governed by a formula designed to ensure that outstanding STAR balances do not exceed specified percentages of a district's property tax levy. Assuming timely filing of claims by districts, any STAR amounts that exceed 25% of a district's property tax levy will be paid in October. Remaining STAR amounts that exceed 20% of levy will be paid in November and STAR owed in excess of 15% of levy will be paid in December. The balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2004. Payment amounts will be based on current data on file at the time of each payment through January. Current statutory provisions that authorize the Commissioner to withhold State aid payments from school districts that have not submitted enrollment and expenditure data on a timely basis shall not apply to STAR aid payments.       57   Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid reimbursement).

GX020-02-16667105	"DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-1 (RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS SEMESTER 1)     Only attendance on religious holidays occurring during the first semester of the 2001-02 school year and duly recognized as such by a resolution of the board of education should be reported on this schedule. Aggregate attendance of each religious holiday listed should be reported on this schedule for all grade levels. Do not list any religious holidays which had no adverse impact on school attendance.       DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-2 (ATTENDANCE SEMESTER 1)     Possible aggregate attendance reported on line 1 represents the sum of the total daily membership (number of students on the the school register on a given day) for each day of session reported on line 4.     Aggregate attendance reported on line 2 represents the sum of the total daily attendance (number of students actually attending school on a given day) for each day of session reported on line 4.     Actual session reported on line 4 represents the number of days during the first semester when students were required to attend school and attendance was recorded. Do not include Regents examination days or full-day superintendent's conference days when attendance was not recorded.     All other lines of data will be calculated by the Data Entry Assistant.       DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-3 (RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS SEMESTER 2)     Only attendance on religious holidays occurring during the second semester of the 2001-02 school year and duly recognized as such by a resolution of the board of education should be reported on this schedule. Aggregate attendance of each religious holiday listed should be reported on this schedule for all grade levels. Do not list any religious holidays which had no adverse impact on school attendance.       DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-4 (ATTENDANCE SEMESTER 2)     Possible aggregate attendance reported on line 1 represents the sum of the total daily membership (number of students on the the school register on a given day) for each day of session reported on line 4.     Aggregate attendance reported on line 2 represents the sum of the total daily attendance (number of students actually attending school on a given day) for each day of session reported on line 4.     Actual session reported on line 4 represents the number of days during the second semester when students were required to attend school and attendance was recorded. Do not include Regents examination days or full-day superintendent's conference days when attendance was not recorded.     All other lines of data will be calculated by the Data Entry Assistant.       DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-5 (DAYS OF SESSION MATRIX)     The Days of Session Matrix is the basis for determining that a minimum of 180 days of session was provided in all schools and grade levels as required by Education Law 3604(7). Use the ""enter grade"" column only if a group of students in a grade grouping fails to have 180 days of total session (line 6), but all other students in the grade grouping do have 180 days of session. If the ""enter grade"" column is used, you must request a ""Session Deviation Worksheet,"" Form SA-129D, from the State Education Department in order to calculate a short session deduction for the students failing to have 180 days. Enter the requested data by grade grouping as follows:     Line 1.   Days when attendance was recorded are those days when students came to school, attendance was taken and a full day of instruction was scheduled or a half day of  instruction was scheduled and a half day superintendent's conference was held. The sum of  Lines 4 from Schedule A2 and A4 for each grade group should be the same as the number reported in Line 1 of Schedule A5.     Line 2.   Days when Regents and/or Basic Competency examinations were administered are those days when such examinations were being administered at the secondary level and attendance was not taken nor instruction scheduled. This entry generally applies only to grades 9-12, but may in certain instances apply to lower grade levels when grade 9-12 students are housed in the same school facility and such lower grades and class schedules for all such grades are disrupted by the examinations since staff are required to properly administer the examinations. Under no circumstances should the district assume and claim perfect attendance for aid purposes on such days. A maximum of 4 Regents Days may be claimed for semester 1 and a maximum of 6 Regents Days may be claimed for semester 2. These days include the rating day.     Line 3.   Days when superintendent's conferences were held are those days used for general staff orientation, curriculum development, in-service education or parent- teacher conferences.  All districts may claim up to 3 superintendent's days for each grade level, and, if at least two of the days are related to implementing higher learning standards and assessments, a total of 4 days may be claimed.  In such cases district may also use one or more of the four superintendent's conference days in units of not less than one hour each.  Such hours may be used before, during or after regularly scheduled daily hours of pupil instruction.   If used before or after regularly scheduled daily hours of pupil instruction, a total of five hours of such staff development activities may be counted as one superintendent's conference day.     Line 4.   Extraordinary condition days are those days, up to five, on which school was not in session because of extraordinarily adverse weather conditions, impairment of heating  facilities, insufficiency of water supply, shortage of fuel, lack of electricity, natural gas leakage, unacceptable levels of chemical substances, or the destruction of a school building either in whole or in part, and for which the Commissioner determines that the school district cannot make up such missed days of instruction by using for the secondary grades all scheduled vacation days prior to the June Regents and for the elementary grades all scheduled vacation days prior to the last day of the June Regents. Commissioner' written approval is required. Special exceptions may be allowed for half day kindergarten classes as indicated at the bottom of the schedule.     Line 5.   Excused days for half day kindergarten classes due to teacher workshops or parent teacher conferences are those days when a half day conference disrupts the normal schedule of either the AM or PM kindergarten classes, but other grade levels are in attendance for the half of the day not devoted to the conference. There may be no more than 1 day difference claimed between a.m. and p.m. sessions.     Line 6.   Total days should equal the sum of all days reported on lines 1 through 5.      Help for SCHEDULE A-6 (DECIMAL DAYS WORKSHEET)         DIRECTIONS FOR SCHEDULE A-7 (ENROLLMENT-CHS DISTRICTS ONLY)     This schedule should be completed only by the central high school districts of Valley Stream, Sewanhaka and Bellmore-Merrick.     |  Top  |  Index  |  State Aid Web Site  |"

GX012-29-5006670	2001-02 Executive Budget Proposal    2000-01 and 2001-02 State Aids  Payable Under Section 3609 Plus Other Aids    COMBINED AIDS           2000-01 Base Year Aids:    For 2000-01 aid, the Actual Valuation (AV) of taxable real property for purposes of determining a district's property wealth per pupil is defined as the 1997 AV. The State average of the 1997 AV per 1998-99 Total Wealth Pupil Unit (TWPU) is  $244,900 . Similarly, income wealth is based on the 1997 Adjusted Gross Income of residents of the district, as reported on State income tax returns and including the results of the statewide computerized income verification process, divided by the TWPU of the district. This is compared to the State average of  $98,300 . The two measures taken together constitute the district's Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR), which is used in determining aid ratios for many formulas. Some formulas use the Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance (RWADA) wealth ratio; the State average 1997 AV per 1998-99 RWADA is  $293,700 . Transportation Aid uses the Enrollment (Resident Public and Nonpublic Enrollment) wealth ratio; the State average is  $252,000 .              Operating : Formula Operating Aid is the greater of Aid Ratio Aid     or $400 multiplied by Selected Total Aidable Pupil Units (TAPU). Aid Ratio Aid is the     product of the Selected Operating Aid Ratio multiplied by $3,900 plus a minimum of 7.5     percent of the positive result of 1998-99 Approved Operating Expense/TAPU for Expense,     limited to no more than $8,000, minus $3,900. The Selected Operating Aid Ratio is the     highest of the following formulas but not less than zero nor more than 0.90:                                   (1) Ratio = 1.37- (1.23 * CWR);                                     (2) Ratio = 1.00 - (0.64 * CWR);                                     (3) Ratio = 0.80 - (0.39 * CWR);                                     (4) Ratio = 0.51 - (0.22 * CWR).                                       Tax Effort + Equalization : For districts with a Pupil Wealth     Ratio below 2.0, Tax Effort Aid is the tax effort percent multiplied by $912.48 multiplied     by the Pupils for Tax Aid. For eligible districts, Tax Equalization is the product of the     positive result of 1998-99 Approved Operating Expense/TAPU for Expense, capped at $8,000,     minus 2000-01 Formula Operating Aid/Selected TAPU minus the product of .01950 multiplied     by the AV/TWPU, the result multiplied by the Pupils for Tax Aid.       Transition Adjustment : An amount calculated to insure that the     2000-01 Subtotal for Transition was a) no less than 1.02 multiplied by the 1999-00     Subtotal for Transition and b) no more than the greater of a 4.27 percent increase over     the 1999-00 Subtotal for Transition or 18.1 percent of the amount withheld by the     Transition Adjustment. For 2000-01 aid, the Transition Adjustment was based on Operating,     Tax Effort and Tax Equalization Aids.       Gifted & Talented : Gifted and Talented Aid as claimed in     2000-01 equals $196 multiplied by 3 percent of the 1999-00 Combined Adjusted ADA.       Minor Maintenance & Repair : The 2000-01 aid claimed by the     district.       Limited English Proficiency : The 1999-00 pupils served     multiplied by 19.9 percent of the Formula Operating Aid per pupil as claimed for 2000-01     aid.       Excess Cost - Public : The 2000-01 Public Excess Cost Aid, based     on 1998-99 Approved Operating Expense/TAPU for Expense in the range of $2,000 to $7,110,     claimed for students with disabilities attending public schools or BOCES including any Due     Save-harmless Aid.       Excess Cost - Private : The 2000-01 Private Excess Cost Aid     claimed for public school students attending private schools for students with     disabilities for whom the district pays tuition.       Extraordinary Needs : This equals a selected amount multiplied by     an extraordinary needs aid ratio (1 - .4 * Income Wealth Ratio) multiplied by an     extraordinary needs pupil count. The selected amount is at least 11 percent of the     Operating Aid ceiling of $3,900 plus the allowance for district spending. No district     receives less aid than in 1999-00.       Educ Related Support Service (ERSSA) : The Educationally Related     Support Services Aid claimed by the district is based on $365.00 multiplied by the     selected operating aid ratio (with a .25 minimum) multiplied by 9 percent of Selected     TAPU. Additional aid was claimed by high poverty districts based on $635.00 multiplied by     the Public Excess cost aid ratio (with a .25 minimum) multiplied by 15 percent of Selected     TAPU.       Extraordinary Needs : This equals a selected amount multiplied by     an extraordinary needs aid ratio (1 - .4 * Income Wealth Ratio) multiplied by an     extraordinary needs pupil count. The selected amount is at least 11 percent of the     Operating Aid ceiling of $3,900 plus the allowance for district spending. No district     receives less aid than in 1999-00.       Operating Standards : This equals selected TAPU multiplied by     $7.50 plus the product of $61.50 multiplied by the Operating Standards aid ratio.

The State average of the 1998 AV per 1999-00 Flex Total Wealth Pupil Unit (Flex TWPU) is  $225,200 . Income wealth is based on 1998 Adjusted Gross Income of residents of the district, as reported on tax returns and including the results of the statewide computerized income verification process, divided by the Flex TWPU of the district. This is compared to the State average of  $92,900 . The Flex AV and Flex Income Wealth ratios are used equally to compute the district's Flex Combined Wealth Ratio (Flex CWR). For continuity in the calculation of aids other than Flex Aid, the State average of the 1998 AV per 1999-00 Total Wealth Pupil Unit (TWPU) is  $247,800 . The State average of 1998 Adjusted Gross Income per 1999-00 Total Wealth Pupil Unit is  $102,200 . Some formulas use the Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance (RWADA) wealth ratio; the State average 1998 AV per 1999-00 RWADA is  $297,000 . Transportation Aid uses the Enrollment (Resident Public and Nonpublic Enrollment) wealth ratio; the State average is  $254,600 .              FLEX Flex Aid : Formula FLEX Flex Aid is the sum of: (1) $20.00     multiplied by Flex Selected TAPU which includes weightings of 0.33 for Flex Free and     Reduced Price Lunch, LEP and Sparsity pupil counts; (2) the product of the  Regional     Cost Factor  multiplied by $100.42 multiplied by the FLEX Flex Aid Ratio (1.37 - (1.10     * FLEX Flex CWR), minimum of .400.00) multiplied by FLEX Flex Selected TAPU; and, (3)     2000-01 total aid for Operating, Tax Effort, Tax Equalization, Transition Adjustment,     Gifted and Talented, Minor Maintenance, Public Excess Cost, Private Excess Cost,     Educationally Related Support Services, Extraordinary Needs, Operating Standards, and     Limited English Proficiency. In addition, districts are ensured a wealth-adjusted minimum     increase of 1.0 percent over the sum of the 2000-01 aids listed above. The wealth     adjustment is 0.010 divided by the Flex Combined Wealth Ratio, and cannot be less than     0.010 nor more than 0.015. For regional cost factors see  Regional Cost     Factor Table  at the end of this description.

This is more than twice the inflationary growth of 23 percent during this same period. Through the combination of school aid and STAR, New York now supports 44 percent of statewide local spending on education, compared to 39 percent just nine years ago. For the coming year, New York will build upon its generous investment in education with an increase of $147 million in regular school aid  bringing State support for public schools to $14.6 billion. State support of New York City's schools has also increased dramatically under Governor Pataki. In the 2004-05 school year, New York City schools will receive $5.4 billion in regular State aid  an increase of $2.1 billion, or 61 percent from 1994-95. As a result of this significant infusion of State funds, New York City schools now receive a share of statewide school aid that exceeds their share of statewide student enrollment. In addition to the $14.6 billion for general school aid, the 2004-05 Executive Budget reserves certain new revenues to support expected reforms related to ensuring that every child has the opportunity to receive a sound basic education. Beginning with the 2004-05 school year, all State revenues generated by Video Lottery Terminals (VLTs) will be dedicated to support the sound basic education requirements set forth in the State Constitution and reaffirmed in a recent decision by the State Court of Appeals. Based upon VLT facilities now being developed, as well as new ones to be authorized in legislation introduced with the Executive Budget, these receipts are expected to approximate $325 million in the 2004-05 school year, growing to $2 billion over the next five years. An allocation from these new overall VLT revenues will supplement a $100 million sound basic education matching grant included in general school aid for New York City. State Commission on Education Reform: In September 2003, Governor Pataki announced the creation of the State Commission on Education Reform  a nonpartisan group of educational,  1   business and community leaders who will develop a comprehensive set of recommendations to address the historic opportunity presented by the Court of Appeals' ruling to overhaul the State's education finance system. The Commission is headed by former NASDAQ Chairman Frank G. Zarb and includes other members with a wide range of expertise and experience from across New York. The Commission has been charged with examining the cost of a sound basic education and recommending reforms to ensure all children have the opportunity for a sound basic education. The Commission will report its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature on March 1, 2004. The Zarb Commission's study and recommendations will be guided by the following principles:  Every school district should have the resources necessary to provide its students, including those students at-risk of academic failure, with the opportunity to obtain a sound basic education; School districts should provide educational services in an effective and efficient manner; The education finance system should allocate State resources in an equitable manner reflective of need and local fiscal capacity; Major changes in the education finance system should be implemented over a reasonable, multi-year transition period to ensure the sustained and stable long-term provision of resources; and All persons involved in the State's education system, including State and local officials, school administrators, teachers, other school personnel, parents and students, should be held accountable for carrying out their responsibilities in an efficient and effective manner.         2   2004-05 Executive Budget Recommendations: Key components of the 2004-05 Executive Budget recommendations for elementary and secondary education include the following:   Seven existing formulas will be merged within a $9,957.15 million Flex Aid program. Certain grant programs are maintained at their previous year's funding level. These include grants for Prekindergarten, Class Size Reduction and Minor Maintenance. (These aids will total $387.80 million.) The Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive program will be funded at its statutory formula amount of $3.66 million. For the 2004-05 school year, funding of $1,359.46 million is recommended for Building Aid. Payment changes enacted in 2003 will be modified and continued for the 2004-05 school year and, as a result, only those projects for which a construction contract has been signed and notification received by the State Education Department by November 15, 2003 will receive funding in 2004-05. Projects for which notification is received by the State Education Department after such date will be eligible for Building Aid in 200506. In 2004-05 BOCES Aid of $24.47 million. A be the lesser of the the amount generated will total $480.58 million, a decrease district's BOCES Aid allocation will amount provided in the base year or under the existing statutory formula.        Public Excess Cost Aid of $2,198.81 million, the same amount as 2003-04, will be incorporated within the overall 2004-05 Flex Aid amount. Also, overall private special education funding will be limited to the current year funding total of $187.42 million. An increase of $20.29 million is provided for expense-based Transportation Aid. Funding for a district's non-capital transportation expenses will be capped at a 2.5 percent increase over the base year amount. Additionally, beginning in 2005-06, transportation-related capital expenditures will be funded consistent with recently adopted reforms in State reimbursement for school construction. During the transition to the new reimbursement program, capital grants will be provided to school districts from proceeds of State bonds. All future transportation-related capital    3   expenditures will be reimbursed over a term consistent with the useful life of the asset.  Allocations for Growth Aid, Textbook Aid, Computer Software and Hardware Aid, Library Materials Aid, and Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid reflect existing statutory formulas. These six aids will total $311.34 million. Various ""below-the-line"" categorical aid programs will be reduced to one-third of the base year amount including Teacher Support Aid (-$44.99 million), Teacher Centers (-$20.00 million), and Teacher-Mentor Intern programs (-$2.67 million). Funding for the Teachers of Tomorrow program will be continued at $20.00 million. A. 2004-05 SCHOOL AID Three years ago, Governor Pataki proposed a fundamental reform to the State's funding for public schools  known as Flex Aid. For 2004-05, the Executive Budget school aid proposal continues to reflect the basic principles of Flex Aid. Existing formulas are simplified and the number of formulas is reduced  seven aid categories are combined into a single consolidated funding stream. School districts also will have maximum flexibility in the use of their Flex Aid amounts. FORMULA-BASED AIDS Flex Aid: For the 2004-05 school year, school districts statewide will receive $9,957.15 million in Flex Aid. The following seven aid categories are combined within Flex Aid at their base-year funding levels: Comprehensive Operating Aid, Extraordinary Needs Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Summer School Aid, Tax Limitation Aid, and Public Excess Cost Aid. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs serving public school children placed in private school settings and in the State-operated schools in Rome and Batavia. The Private Excess Cost aid formula is modified to eliminate existing fiscal incentives to place children in restrictive program settings. For 2004-05, the      4   statewide amount for this program will be limited to the current year funding total of $187.42 million. BOCES Aid: BOCES Aid will total $480.58 million, a year-toyear decrease of $24.47 million, or 4.85 percent, from 2003-04. A district's BOCES Aid allocation will be the lesser of the amount provided in the base year or the amount generated under the existing statutory formula. The 2004-05 Executive Budget also recommends reforms to refocus Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) on their core mission to promote cost-efficiency through the regional delivery of educational services. This goal will be accomplished by:   Eliminating BOCES Aid for routine administrative services; and Ensuring true cost-efficiency in BOCES contracts for telecommunications and other services by requiring BOCES to demonstrate savings compared to existing State contract prices available through the Office of General Services.  Special Services Aid: Special Services Aid funds career education programs and computer services for school districts which are not components of a BOCES. All existing provisions of law are continued. The career education aid ceiling for 2004-05 is continued at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. For 2004-05, this aid will total $131.03 million, a decrease of $1.34 million. Transportation Aid: For 2004-05, the minimum aid ratio for Transportation Aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved transportation expenses). The aid ratio choice permitting school districts to receive aid based on public and non-public enrollments is continued and will benefit districts transporting large numbers of nonpublic school students. Districts may also claim aid based on the transportation of pupils in summer school courses to improve performance during the summer of 2003. District expenditures for transportation to and from school district operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5.00 million statewide.  5   For 2004-05, a district's Transportation Aid allocation for non-capital expenses will be limited to a maximum increase of 2.5 percent over base-year aid for such expenditures. Transportation Aid will total $1,097.23 million in 2004-05, an increase of $20.29 million. Additionally, beginning in 2005-06, transportation-related capital expenditures will be funded consistent with recently adopted reforms in State reimbursement for school construction. In 2004-05, during the transition to the new reimbursement program, capital grants will be provided to school districts from proceeds of State bonds. All future transportation-related capital expenditures will be reimbursed over a term consistent with the useful life of the asset. Building/Reorganization Incentive Building Aid: For 200405, Building Aid to support school building projects throughout the State (including Reorganization Incentive Aid for building expenses incurred by those school districts that reorganize under provisions of the Education Law) will total $1,359.46 million, an increase of $152.13 million. The 10 percent Building Aid enrichment provided for projects approved July 1, 1998 and thereafter is continued in 2004-05. Projects approved by voters beginning July 1, 2000 receive Building Aid based on the greater of their current year AV/RWADA aid ratio or their 1999-00 Building Aid ratio reduced by 10 percentage points. State aid for all construction projects will be paid over the useful life of the project (15 years for reconstruction, 20 years for major construction/additions and 30 years for new buildings). Additionally, reflective of legislation enacted with the 2003-04 State Budget payment will be deferred for new construction projects in instances in which the school district did not file a notice that a general construction contract has been signed with the Commissioner of Education by November 15, 2003. Aid on these projects will be paid in July 2005. Building Aid Reforms: To ensure limited State and local resources are effectively targeted to address school facility needs across New York, the following additional reforms are proposed for the coming year:  Priority-Based Project Selection: The existing open-ended building aid program will be replaced with a priority-based system, which will apply to all projects approved by the State Education Department after February 1, 2004. There will also be a temporary moratorium on State aid for new  6   construction until the new priority-based system is implemented.  Simplified State Aid Calculation: The building aid formula will be modified to include a simplified reimbursement methodology that provides realistic allowances for construction costs and student-based space needs. State Clearinghouse for Efficient Construction Practices and Designs: Centralized technical expertise and assistance will be available to school districts from the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY), which will provide advisory services on efficient construction practices and designs. These services include:    Project Planning (i.e., master planning, feasibility studies, cost-benefit analyses, and access to costefficient designs); Quality Review and Assurance (e.g., analysis of materials selection and third party review of construction documents); and Construction Consultation and Review (e.g., review and resolution of construction issues, and analysis of change orders).    Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid: Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid is provided for operating expenses incurred by school districts that are scheduled for reorganization. It is paid as a supplement based on formula Operating Aid when districts meet certain conditions prescribed by law.1 Since 1992, the operating aid enhancement for reorganizing districts has been 40 percent per year for the first five years after which the percentage of additional operating aid decreases four percent per year. The statutory provisions for Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid remain unchanged. For 2004-05, aid will amount to $14.74 million, a decrease of $2.79 million. Textbook and Computer Aids: For the 2004-05 school year, the existing statutory funding provisions apply:  Textbook Aid: These funds reimburse school districts for the purchase of textbooks which are loaned to both public  1  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, Formula Operating Aid, which is described in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law, will be used.  7   and nonpublic pupils. Schools are also able to qualify for reimbursement based on eligible purchases of contentbased instructional materials in an electronic format. The lottery funded portion of Textbook Aid is $15.00 per pupil. The general fund portion will be $42.30 per pupil, for a combined maximum Textbook Aid payment of $57.30 per pupil. The existing statutory formula for this aid will provide $188.65 million in 2004-05, a decrease of $0.36 million.  Computer Software Aid: Under this program, aid is apportioned to districts for the purchase and loan of computer software. Software programs designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils pursuant to the Rules of the Board of Regents. For the 2004-05 school year, districts will be reimbursed for expenses up to $14.98 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2004-05, Computer Software Aid will total $46.40 million, an increase of $0.52 million. Instructional Computer Hardware and Technology Equipment Aid: This aid category provides funding for the lease or purchase of mini- and microcomputers, computer terminals and technology equipment for instructional purposes, for repair costs and for staff development. Computer Hardware Aid equals approved expense (up to $19.25 per pupil, adjusted by the current year AV/RWADA aid ratio). For the 2004-05 school year, $28.38 million, an increase of $0.28 million, is recommended.    Library Materials Aid: Districts are reimbursed for expenses up to $6.00 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2004-05, Library Materials Aid will total $19.58 million, an increase of $0.32 million. Materials purchased under this program and designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils. Prekindergarten Aid: Beginning in 1998-99, State funds were provided to expand the availability of prekindergarten programs for four-year-old children statewide. For 2004-05, funding of $201.34 million is continued for State prekindergarten grants.  8   Class Size Reduction Aid: For 2004-05, $136.49 is continued to enable school districts to reduce class size in kindergarten and in grades one through three.2 Minor Maintenance Aid: For 2004-05, $49.97 million will be continued for support of minor maintenance projects necessary to preserve school facilities statewide. Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive Aid: This aid category provides funding to encourage school districts to establish full-day kindergarten programs intended to strengthen the quality of education for five-year-old children. School districts first offering full-day kindergarten programs in 200405 will receive current year formula Operating Aid for any increase in the number of students served in full-day programs in 2004-05 compared to 2003-04. For 2004-05, a total of $3.66 million, a decrease of $3.91 million, is provided for this program reflecting a continuing decline in the level of new incentive grant applications from school districts. New York City Sound Basic Education Grant: For 2004-05, $100.00 million is provided for New York City consistent with ensuring its schools provide students with the opportunity for a sound basic education. This grant must be matched by an equal additional amount from New York City. This amount will be in addition to an allocation provided to New York City from the overall $325 million VLT reserve. GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER AID CATEGORIES Growth Aid: Growth Aid will be paid as a separate apportionment to qualifying districts in June 2005. As provided for in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996, a district's growth index is calculated based on the change in enrollment. For 200405, $13.59 million is provided through the statutory formula for Growth Aid, a decrease of $16.34 million. Teachers of Tomorrow: For 2004-05, $20.00 million will be continued for incentives such as awards and stipends to retain and attract teachers into New York's classrooms, particularly in areas where teacher shortages exist. Of available funds, $12.00 million, or 60 percent, will go to New York City. 2  A funding total of up to $201.94 million is available for Prekindergarten Aid and up to $138.31 million for Class Size Reduction Aid.  9   Teacher Support Aid: Funding of $22.49 million, a decrease of $44.99 million is recommended for this program in the 2004-05 school year.

New York City Yonkers Buffalo Rochester Syracuse Newburgh Albany Mount Vernon Poughkeepsie Schenectady New Rochelle Utica Port Chester White Plains Niagara Falls Freeport Middletown Beacon Greenburgh Peekskill $48,175,000 29,500,000 17,025,000 11,000,000 11,000,000 4,645,000 2,050,000 2,000,000 1,975,000 1,800,000 1,410,000 1,200,000 1,150,000 900,000 600,000 400,000 400,000 366,000 300,000 200,000  Aid to Small City School Districts: Aid for small city school districts was instituted as a grant program by Chapter 288 of the Laws of 1979, and was intended to provide funds to districts at or near constitutional tax limits. With the removal of small city constitutional tax limits by a referendum in 1985, aid to small city school districts is provided to permit such districts to adjust their taxes gradually to an appropriate level. A total of $81.88 million, the same amount as in 2003-04, will be allocated to small city school districts for the 2004-05 school year. Urban-Suburban Transfer: A total of $1.13 million will be provided in 2004-05 to districts that participate in a voluntary interdistrict transfer between urban and suburban school districts to reduce racial isolation.

Education of Homeless Children: Chapter 348 of the Laws of 1988 amended Section 3602 of the Education Law to institute this program of State aid under which school districts where homeless children are temporarily located are reimbursed for the direct cost of educating such children. This cost to the State is partially recaptured from the district of last attendance for each such homeless child by deducting an amount equal to the district's basic contribution per pupil from the district's State aid. The net cost of aid for homeless pupils in 2004-05 is estimated at $5.91 million, an increase of $0.30 million. Aid for Incarcerated Youth: A total of $14.50 million, an increase of $0.50 million, is recommended to continue support for the provision of educational services to youth detained in local correctional facilities. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 564 of the Laws of 2001, eligibility for State aid is now expanded to include youth shelters which are court-approved residential facilities used as alternatives to incarceration. State Bilingual Categorical Funds: In 2004-05, $11.20 million will be used to continue existing funding of regional bilingual programs at BOCES and to support innovative Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs. Such programs employ two languages (one of which is English) for the purpose of instruction and involve students whose native language is other than English.

These programs affect school districts, but they are typically not funded in the General Support for Public Schools appropriations. New York State Center for School Safety: For 2004-05, $475,000 will be made available through the New York State Center for School Safety to disseminate information and provide training and technical assistance on violence prevention to schools and communities. Civility, Citizenship and Character Education Curriculum: In 2000, the Legislature enacted the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education (SAVE) initiative which incorporated recommendations of the Task Force on School Violence chaired by Lieutenant Governor Mary Donohue. This program was not funded in the 2003-04 school year. For 2004-05, a total of $500,000 is provided to continue support for the development of curricula in grades K-12 that will instruct children on principles such as honesty, tolerance, personal responsibility, respect for others, observance of laws and rules, courtesy and dignity. Charter School Stimulus Fund: For the 2004-05 school year, a total of $6.00 million is provided by the State for start-up grants to charter schools and administrative and technical support provided by the Charter School Institute for the 2004-05 school year. Also, Federal funding of $6.80 million is provided for start-up costs of charter schools. This Federal funding  13   represents the third year of funding under the Federal Charter School Program Grant. Charter schools will enroll over 20,000 New York State students in more than 50 schools with additional schools expected to open in 2005-06. Basic Education for Public Assistance Recipients: For 200405, $5.00 million is continued for programs for adult basic education for public assistance recipients including reading, mathematics, and life skills offered to public assistance recipients 16 years of age or older who have a reading level below the ninth grade.

The Federal share in the School Lunch and Breakfast Program under the Food and Nutrition Fund will equal $670 million for the 2004-05 Federal fiscal year, an increase of $39 million, or 6 percent compared to 2003-04. Education of Native Americans: A total of $19.00 million, an increase of $3.00 million, is provided for the full cost of elementary and secondary education (including transportation expenses) for Native American children as authorized by Article 83 of the Education Law. The program funds services to approximately 2,500 children living on 9 reservations and educated in 3 reservation schools, 13 public school districts and 4 BOCES.  14   Nonpublic School Aid: A total of $83.30 million, is appropriated to reimburse the actual expenses incurred by nonpublic schools for specified State testing and datacollection activities, pursuant to the provisions of Chapters 507 and 508 of the Laws of 1974. This funding level is $2.50 million more than that provided for during the 2003-04 school year ($8.00 million is included in the base-year total that is recommended in the 2003-04 deficiency bill). Academic Intervention for Nonpublic Schools: A total of $1.00 million will be available to support a program of academic intervention services to enhance the educational performance of students attending nonpublic schools.

An increase of $5.00 million is provided in 200405 to support cost increases of the schools. To ensure appropriate service delivery and oversight of the Deaf Infant program, the Executive Budget proposes the transfer of this program to the Department of Health for oversight and inclusion in the Early Intervention program that serves disabled infants and toddlers until they are three years old. This transfer reduces the appropriation by $1.00 million resulting in an overall year-to-year increase of $4.00 million. Preschool Special Education: Pursuant to section 4410 of the Education Law, $552.20 million is continued for the State's share of the costs of education for three- and four-year old children with disabilities. Similar to 2003-04, prior year claims on file with the State Education Department as of April 1, 2004 will receive priority treatment. Any remaining claims for which there is insufficient appropriation authority to pay in 2004-05 will receive priority status for payment in 2005-06. Summer School Program for Disabled Students: An appropriation of $182.40 million, an increase of $8.70 million, is recommended to meet the State's 70 percent share of costs of summer school programs for school-age pupils with disabilities pursuant to Section 4408 of the Education Law. The 2004-05 appropriation will fund prior year liabilities and up to 70 percent of the 2004-05 school year obligations with the remainder to be funded in the subsequent State fiscal year.  15   Special Education - Federal Medicaid Recovery: For the 2004-05 State fiscal year, Chapter 53 continues a $170.00 million offset to State special education costs based on recovery of Federal medicaid funds for medically related services provided to eligible children in special education programs.

School Health Demonstration Project funding is recommended at $142,500, generating savings of $7,500; and Children of Migrant Workers funding is recommended at $85,500, generating savings of $4,500.    Advances to HURD City School Districts: A total of $7,601,000 in loan funds (HURD advances) is appropriated in 2004-05 for city school districts first eligible to receive loans pursuant to Chapter 280 of the Laws of 1978. Commencing with 1992-93, pursuant to Chapter 280 of the Laws of 1978 as amended by Chapter 53 of the Laws of 1991, district advances are being reduced by 5 percent per year, until no advances are made in the 2011-2012 school year. Fiscal Stabilization Grants/Prior Year Claims: The 2004-05 Executive Budget recommends $28.00 million for payment of prior year claims and/or fiscal stabilization grants for the 2004-05 school year. This represents a reduction of $62.00 million in Fiscal Stabilization grants for New York City reflecting provisions of Chapter 63 of the Laws of 2003 (the New York City Omnibus Aid bill) that have mitigated the need for these funds in 2004-05.  17   SCHOOL TAX RELIEF (STAR) PROGRAM Chapter 389 of the Laws of 1997 established New York State's School TAx Relief (STAR) program which will provide $2.44 billion in 2004-05 to reimburse school districts for State-authorized property tax relief for homeowners. Senior homeowners at least 65 years old and with incomes up to $63,750 are eligible to receive exemptions of at least $50,000 from the full value of their primary residences for school tax purposes. The property tax component of the STAR program will also provide other homeowners with at least a $30,000 exemption from the full value of their primary residence for school property tax purposes. In those counties where the median value of homes exceeds the statewide median home value, as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS), the value of the exemptions will be increased. The State will reimburse school districts dollar-for-dollar for the property tax revenues foregone from these exemptions. School District Reimbursement for STAR STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies to the Commissioner of Education amounts payable under the STAR program and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements in the 2004-05 school year will be governed by a statutory formula designed to ensure that outstanding STAR balances do not exceed specified percentages of a district's property tax levy. Assuming timely filing of claims by districts, any STAR amounts that exceed 25% of a district's property tax levy will be paid in October. Remaining STAR amounts that exceed 20% of levy will be paid in November and STAR owed in excess of 15% of levy will be paid in December. The balance of STAR due to districts will be paid on the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2005.  18   2004-05 Budget STAR-Related Changes New STAR Credit: The Executive Budget will enrich the school tax relief measures enacted under the STAR program. Under the existing STAR program, school tax relief will total $3.0 billion in 2004-05. A new State STAR credit will provide additional tax relief to recognize the effects of inflation on STAR benefits. As a result, local taxpayers will save an additional $43 million against their property taxes in the coming year, paid to them as a credit on their income tax. Under the new STAR credit, the increase in the Consumer Price Index will be used to adjust STAR benefits that currently average $1,080 for seniors receiving the $50,000 enhanced exemption and $710 for other homeowners receiving the $30,000 basic exemption. The STAR credit will be available for all homeowners in school districts that keep their spending within the proposed spending cap. Capping School Spending Increases: To protect taxpayers from unrestrained school tax increases, the Governor is proposing legislation that caps school budget increases. A school district's annual spending could not exceed 4 percent or 120 percent of the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the prior year, whichever is less. Expenditures driven by factors beyond the control of school districts -- e.g. enrollment increases, certiorari costs and court ordered funding to provide a sound basic education -- are exempt from the cap. Local taxpayers could approve spending increases above the spending cap with a two-thirds majority vote. School Property Tax Report Card: The 2004-05 Executive Budget proposes to expand the School Property Tax Report Card to require school districts to include information displaying the three year change in the school tax levy compared to the change in the consumer price index thereby helping local taxpayers review school spending trends.  19   OTHER INITIATIVES Charter Schools: In September 1999, the opening of New York's first three charter schools marked the beginning of one of the most significant education reforms in State history. To date, 55 charter schools have been established across the State and serve more than 20,000 students. For 2004-05, the State will continue this reform by maintaining funding of $6 million in support for the Charter School Stimulus Fund. This funding will help meet existing facility needs and support the development of new charter schools. Mandate Relief: To alleviate the costly burden of mandates on our schools, the following reforms are recommended:  The Board of Regents will be required to obtain the review and approval of the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform for new regulations that would have substantial costs for schools, the State or local governments. Schools will benefit from an exemption from Wicks Law requirements, which mandate the use of multiple contractors. This reform will reduce the cost of new school construction by more than 10 percent.    Advantage Schools: The Advantage After-School Program provides school-age children with supervised educational and social activities during non-school hours. The Governor's Budget restores the Advantage Schools program to $20.2 million in 200405, $10.2 million more than the enacted 2003-04 budget. This increase is expected to return Advantage Schools to a full program level, providing vital after-school services to more than 25,000 children throughout the State.  20   II SUMMARY OF 2004-05 SCHOOL YEAR/FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATIONS School Year/Fiscal Year Impact There are two time frames to consider when discussing 200405 New York State aid programs relating to support for public schools: the 2004-05 school year which runs from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005; and the 2004-05 State fiscal year which runs from April 1, 2004 through March 31, 2005.

There are 250 districts that are projected to have decreases of $36.30 million. The combined total of increases and reductions produce a net increase statewide of $240.69 million, or 1.75 percent.  Table II-C lists the aid amounts allocated to each of the Big Five city school districts under selected School Aid programs. The aids analyzed are those shown in Table II-A. Table II-D lists changes in all School Aid individual aid categories for New York City. The net increase for all aids is 1.05 percent. In Table II-E, major 2004-05 aid categories have been combined to show the overall impact upon school districts in the State's 18 most populous counties, New York City, and the rest of the State. The State average increase for these aids will be 1.75 percent. The 371 districts in the 18 most populous counties contain 48.74 percent of the State's public school pupils. These districts will receive 43.36 percent of the 2004-05 combined aids total. Districts in the 18 most populous counties will have an average increase in combined aids of 1.62 percent.

Each of the appendices is described below.  Appendix III-A summarizes the School Aid categories and adjustments recommended for 2004-05 and compares them with the 2003-04 aid categories. Appendix III-B provides the mathematical formulas for computing 16 different aids for 2004-05 school aid payments. Appendix III-C describes the pupil counts used in aid formulas. Appendix III-D describes the payment schedule for aids payable under section 3609 of the Education Law in the 2004-05 school year.       28   APPENDIX III-A COMPARISON OF 2003-04 AND 2004-05 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS Category FLEX AID 2003-04 School Year None 2004-05 School Year The sum of a district's 2003-04 comprehensive operating, extraordinary needs aid, erssa, limited English proficiency, summer school, tax limitation and public excess cost aid. None Comprehensive Operating Aid is one of 7 existing formulas that will be replaced by Flex Aid.  COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING AID  School districts statewide will receive aid equal to the 2002-03 sum of Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid minus a reduction calculation described below. Each district will be assessed a reduction amount equal to 1.75 percent of its 2002-03 total for the 4 aid categories noted above. All districts will be assessed an additional reduction amount calculated using Free and Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) data and the school district's Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR).3 The higher the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch programs and the lower the per pupil income and property wealth of the district, the smaller the amount of the district's additional reduction.  3  A district's Combined Wealth Ratio for 2003-04 is equal to: (.5 x District Pupil Wealth Ratio) + (.5 x District Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio). The district Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: (2000 Actual Valuation)/2001-02 TWPU $281,000 ; and the Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: 2000 District Income/2001-02 TWPU $128,600  29   Category  2003-04 School Year The combined loss for districts will range from 2.25 percent to 6.30 percent of their 2002-03 aid total for the 4 aid categories noted above.

Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid including formula components such as the Combined Wealth Ratio will be used. The calculation for Formula Operating Aid is cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law and is described more fully in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law. A district's Combined Wealth Ratio for 2004-05 is equal to: (.5 x District Pupil Wealth Ratio) + (.5 x District Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio). The district Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: (2001 Actual Valuation)/2002-03 TWPU $306,200 ; and the Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: 2001 District Income/2002-03 TWPU $122,100 Beginning with the 1997-98 school year, income and actual valuation data moved back one year from the previous year-prior-to-the-base-year data. The Actual Valuation (AV) for calculating a district's property wealth per pupil for 1997-98 was 1994 AV. The income wealth per pupil calculation used the 1994 Adjusted Gross Income of district residents. For the 2004-05 school year, 2001 Actual Valuation and Adjusted Gross Income will be used.  30   Category  2003-04 School Year applicants times 2002 enrollment, plus the number of Limited English Proficiency students, plus a sparsity factor based on a calculation of enrollment per square mile times 2002 enrollment.  2004-05 School Year  URBAN-SUBURBAN TRANSFER SUPPLEMENTATION  If comprehensive operating aid per pupil is greater in the district of residence, the district of attendance will receive urban-suburban transfer aid equal to the formula operating aid per pupil that the district of residence would have received.  Qualifying districts will receive the same aid that they would have received in the 2000-01 school year.

Total Aidable Pupil Units Total Wealth Pupil Units Average Daily Attendance Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance  40   FLEX AID The 2004-05 ELFA Appropriation Bill For the 2004-05 school year, each district will receive Flex Aid. Total aid for this category will equal the 2003-04 sum of 7 previous aid categories (based on data on file with the State Education Department on November 15, 2003). The 7 previous aid categories include Comprehensive Operating Aid, Extraordinary Needs Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Summer School Aid, Tax Limitation Aid and Public Excess Cost Aid. EXCESS COST AID FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL PUPILS Education Law, Section 4405, Subdivision 3, paragraphs a and b Education Law, Section 4401, Subdivision 6 and 7 The 2004-05 ELFA Appropriation Bill A district receives private excess cost aid for pupils with disabilities in private school settings and the two State-operated schools. The aid is computed on a student-by-student basis with a district receiving private excess cost aid for each student. Private Excess Cost Aid Private Excess Cost Aid = Aidable Cost x Excess Cost Aid Ratio (per pupil) Aidable Cost = Tuition  (Basic Contribution per enrolled pupil) Basic Contribution = Based on a district's property and nonproperty taxes divided by its base-year enrollment. Excess Cost Aid Ratio = 1  (Combined Wealth Ratio x .15) Minimum: .50  Private Excess Cost Taper for Rome and Batavia Placements Additional aid is available to districts with: (i) Continued pupil placements at the two State-operated schools for pupils originally placed in one of the two schools prior to July 1, 1990; and A Combined Wealth Ratio of less than 1.0.  (ii)  Taper for Rome and Batavia Placements = Taper Aidable Cost x Taper Aid Ratio Taper Aidable Cost = Tuition  Regular Private Excess Cost Aid Taper Aid Ratio = 1.0  (Combined Wealth Ratio) .75 Maximum: 1.0  41   Limit on Aid: Based on data on file with the State Education Department on November 15, 2003, if the 2004-05 statewide total for this aid category exceeds the 2003-04 school year statewide total, each school district's 200405 aid will be multiplied by a factor obtained by dividing the 2003-04 statewide total by the 2004-05 statewide total(0.91925). SPECIAL SERVICES AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 17 Districts that are non-components of a BOCES, including the Big 5 City school districts, are eligible to receive career education aid and computer administration aid. Career Education Aid = $3,720 x Aid Ratio x Career Ed Pupils Aid Ratio = 1  (Combined Wealth Ratio x .59) Minimum: .360  Career Education Pupils = 2003-04 Grade 10-12 ADA in a Career Education Trade Sequence + (.16 x Business Sequence ADA) Computer Administration Aid = (Expenses up to $62.30 x Enrollment) X Computer Expenses Aid Ratio Enrollment = Fall 2003 public enrollment attending in the district Computer Expenses Aid Ratio = 1  (Combined Wealth Ratio x .51) Minimum: .300  REORGANIZATION INCENTIVE OPERATING AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 14, paragraphs d and f A district which has reorganized within the past 14 years is eligible to receive reorganization incentive operating aid in addition to its regular operating aid. Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid = Formula Operating Aid x Incentive Aid Percentage  The sum of a district's Formula Operating Aid and Incentive Operating Aid may not exceed 95 percent of its AOE. Reorganization Prior to July 1, 1983: Incentive Operating Aid was available for school districts which reorganized prior to July 1, 1983, for 14 years beginning with the first school year of operation as a reorganized district. For the first five years the Incentive Aid Percentage was 10 percent, and for the next nine years the percentage of such operating aid decreased 1 percent per year.  42   Reorganization After July 1, 1983: For districts which reorganized after July 1, 1983, the reorganization percentage was 20 percent for a period of five years, to be reduced by 2 percent per year for ten years. Reorganization After July 1, 1992: For districts which reorganize after July 1, 1992, the reorganization percentage will be 40 percent for a period of five years, to be reduced by 4 percent per year for ten years. BOCES AID Education Law, Section 1950, Subdivision 5 The 2004-05 ELFA Appropriation Bill Districts which are components of Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) are eligible to receive BOCES operating, capital, and rental aids, with the total subject to a save-harmless provision. BOCES Operating Aid = Base Year Approved Expenses x Aid Ratio Approved Expenses includes salaries of BOCES employees up to $30,000 Aid Ratio = greater of: (i) 1.008 District Actual Valuation Tax Rate (Local Revenue/Actual Valuation) (2001 Actual Valuation/2002-03 RWADA Statewide Average ($366,200) .360 .900 x .51  (ii)  1-  Minimum: Maximum:  BOCES Capital Aid = 2004-05 Capital Expense x RWADA Aid Ratio BOCES Rental Aid = 2004-05 Rental Expense x RWADA Aid Ratio Save-Harmless Provision A district may receive the greater of: (i) (ii) 2004-05 BOCES Operating, Capital and Rental aids BOCES aid received during 1967-68  Limit on Aid: For the 2004-05 school year, aid will equal the lesser of aid calculated by the State Education Department for the 2004-05 or 2003-04 school year based on data on file on November 15, 2003.  43   TRANSPORTATION AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 7 The 2004-05 ELFA Appropriation Bill Districts are allotted reimbursement for transportation expenses through the transportation aid formula. Beginning in 2005-06, transportation-related capital expenditures will be funded consistent with recently adopted reforms in State reimbursement for school construction. In 2004-05, during the transition to the new reimbursement program, capital grants will be provided to school districts from proceeds of State-supported bonds. All future transportation-related capital expenditures will be reimbursed over a term consistent with the useful life of the asset. Transportation Aid = [Aid Ratio + Sparsity Factor] x Approved Expenses Aid Ratio = greatest of three aid ratio calculations, two of which are based on a district's Actual Valuation per pupil: (i) (ii) (iii) 1.263 x Formula Operating Aid Ratio 1.010  (2001 AV/2002-03 RWADA x .46) Statewide Average ($366,200) 1.010  (2001 AV/2002-03 Resident Public & Nonpublic Enrollment x .46) Statewide Average ($319,300) Minimum: .065 Maximum: .900  Sparsity Factor = 21.00  2002-03 Public Enrollment/Square Mile 317.88 Limit on Aid: A 2.5 percent maximum year-to-year increase for aid for noncapital expenditures. Approved Transportation Expenses include:               Health and life insurance Collision insurance Equipment Uniforms Driver and mechanic salaries Supervisor and other salaries Operating and maintenance expenses Social Security payments on all salaries Full contract expenses Retirement benefits Computerized bus routing services Transportation of children to and from day care centers Transportation of pupils in voluntary interdistrict programs District expenditures for transportation of pupils to and from district-operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5.0 million statewide  44   But do not include:      Transportation of pupils less than 1-1/2 miles from school Field trips Salaries of assistant drivers on regular buses (district operated programs) Salaries of drivers and mechanics who work on other than bus-type vehicles Bus purchase expenses exceeding the State contract price  BUILDING AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 6 School districts with approved building projects that have met all eligibility requirements as of the November 15th database may receive building aid to be paid according to an assumed amortization schedule. Aid is available for expenses related to the installation of computer laboratory hardware and for the purchase of stationary metal detectors. Building Aid = Selected Aid Ratio x Approved Building Expenses Current Aid Ratio = 1  (2001 Actual Valuation/2002-03 RWADA x .51) Statewide Average ($366,200) Approved Building Expenses: For projects associated with any existing bonds, bond anticipation notes (BANs) and lease-purchase agreements that have principal remaining as of July 1, 2002, an assumed amortization will be applied to determine building and reorganization incentive building aid. The assumed amortization is based on approved project costs, the term of borrowing and an assumed interest rate. New projects subject to prospective assumed amortization are those that were either approved by the Commissioner of Education on or after December 1, 2001, or, for which debt (bonds, BANs, and capital notes) is first issued on or after such date. Each project is assigned a useful life, cost allowance and assumed interest rate. The State share of financing costs associated with refinancings are reimbursed in full to districts. In addition, districts are reimbursed for lease expenses and on a one year lag for costs of exceptional expenses including metal detectors, condition surveys, and capital outlay exception. Selected Aid Ratio: For projects approved prior to July 1, 2000, districts may use the higher of the current year aid ratio or the aid ratio computed for use in any year commencing with the 1981-82 school year. Starting with all new building projects approved by the voters after July 1, 2000, the selected building aid ratio is based upon the greater of a school district's current-year building aid ratio or the aid ratio selected for use in 1999-00 reduced by 10 percentage points. For projects approved between July 1, 2000 and July 1, 2004, school districts with a pupil wealth ratio greater than 2.50 and an alternate pupil wealth ratio less than .850 in the year in which the project is approved may  45   select an aid ratio equal to 1.263 multiplied by the district's Formula Operating Aid Ratio. Incentive: For aid payable in 1998-99 and after for new projects approved by the voters after 7/1/98, districts will continue to receive an additional 10 percent State reimbursement. However, the sum of the incentive and the selected aid ratio may not exceed .950. In addition, cost allowances on all contracts awarded after 7/1/98 will be adjusted to reflect regional costs for school districts in high cost areas of the State. REORGANIZATION INCENTIVE BUILDING AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 14, paragraphs e and f For building projects related to reorganization, the district may receive reorganization incentive building aid in addition to its regular building aid. Aid is paid on projects for which the general construction contract is signed prior to July 1, 2004 or within ten years from the effective date of the reorganization, whichever is later. For districts reorganizing prior to July 1, 1983, Reorganization Incentive Building Aid = Approved Expenses x Building Aid Ratio x 25%  For districts reorganizing after July 1, 1983, Reorganization Incentive Building Aid = Approved Expenses x Building Aid Ratio x 30%  In no case may the sum of regular Building Aid plus Incentive Building Aid exceed 95 percent of approved expenditures. COMPUTER SOFTWARE AID Education Law, Section 751 All districts are eligible for computer software aid. The aid is for the purchase of computer software which a pupil is required to use as a learning aid in a particular class in the school the pupil attends. Computer Software Aid = 2003-04 Cost of Software (up to $14.98) x Enrollment Enrollment = Fall 2003 public and private school enrollment for the district of attendance plus BOCES and private school pupils in full-time programs for children with disabilities.  46   TEXTBOOK AID Education Law, Section 701, Subdivisions 4, 6 and 7 All districts are eligible for textbook aid. The aid provided is to be used by districts to purchase textbooks to be made available to all resident enrolled pupils. Textbook Aid = 2003-04 Cost of Textbooks, not to exceed $57.30 x 200304 Resident Public and Nonpublic School Enrollment INSTRUCTIONAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 26 A district may be eligible for computer hardware aid to purchase or lease micro-and/or minicomputer equipment or terminals as well as technology equipment for instructional purposes. Schools may use up to 20 percent of hardware aid for the repair of instructional computer hardware and technology equipment or for training and staff development for instructional purposes. Technology equipment is defined as equipment used in conjunction with or in support of educational programs including, but not limited to, video, solar energy, robotic, satellite or laser equipment. Approved expenses for technology education equipment were first eligible for aid in the 1992-93 school year. Beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the local match was eliminated. Hardware Aid = 2003-04 Approved Expenses (up to $19.25 x Selected TAPU for Payment x Current Year Building Aid Ratio) LIBRARY MATERIALS AID Education Law, Section 711, Subdivision 4 All districts are eligible for library materials aid. The aid is provided to enable districts to purchase necessary library materials to be made available on an equitable basis to all pupils attending public and nonpublic schools within such district. Library Materials Aid  2003-04 Cost of Library Materials (up to $6.00) x Enrollment Enrollment = Fall 2003 public and private school enrollment for the district of attendance plus BOCES and private school pupils in full-time programs for children with disabilities.  47   FULL-DAY KINDERGARTEN INCENTIVE AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 12-a Eligibility for Full-Day K Incentive Aid: If in 1996-97 and 2003-04 a district had half-day kindergarten enrollment or if a district had no kindergarten enrollment in 1996-97 and 2003-04. School districts offering full-day kindergarten programs to all kindergarten students will receive current year formula operating aid in 2004-05 for any increase in the number of students served in full-day programs in 2004-05 compared to 2003-04 Full-Day K Incentive Aid = (2004-05 Estimated Full-Day K Enrollment  2003-04 Full-Day K Enrollment) x Formula Operating Aid per TAPU. GROWTH AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 13 For the 2004-05 school year, growth aid is distributed to districts that are eligible due to an increase in enrollment. Districts whose growth index is greater than 1.004 receive growth aid. Growth Aid = (Growth Index  1.004) x Formula Operating Aid6 Growth Index = 2004-05 Estimated Enrollment 2003-04 Enrollment EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION EDUCATION (EPE) AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 24 Districts are eligible for EPE aid for the attendance of pupils age 21 or older who have not received a high school diploma or equivalency diploma. Since 1991-92, aid paid directly to BOCES for approved BOCES EPE programs has been based on component districts' aid ratios. Beginning in 1995-96, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been based on the aggregate actual valuation and TWPU of the component districts of the BOCES. Adults can register with BOCES for participation at a BOCES site. Since 1996-97, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been the greater of the EPE aid ratio based on the aggregate wealth of the component districts or 85 percent of the highest EPE aid ratio of a component district of the BOCES. EPE Aid = $8.05 x EPE Aid Ratio x EPE Hours EPE Aid Ratio = 1  (Pupil Wealth Ratio x .40) Minimum: 6  .400  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid (as cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used.  48   Pupil Wealth Ratio = 2001 Actual Valuation/2002-03 TWPU State Average ($306,200) EPE Hours = Total hours of instruction for all students in EPE programs between July 1 and June 30 of the current year. EPE aid will be reduced if it and other State and Federal sources of aid for EPE programs exceed the entire cost of such program in that year. For the 2004-05 school year, total aid is limited to $84.00 million. INCARCERATED YOUTH AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 35 All districts are eligible for incarcerated youth aid. The aid is provided to enable districts to educate students in local centers of detention. Incarcerated Youth Aid equals the lesser of: (i) (ii) = 2002-03 AOE/TAPU x Number of full-day program pupils1 + ([.5 x (AOE/TAPU)] x Number of half-day program pupils) Actual total instructional cost for the incarcerated youth program plus approved administrative costs (which may not exceed five percent of total instructional costs)  1  2002-03 AOE/TAPU x 1.25 x pupils in 10 month programs or 2002-03 AOE/TAPU x 1.50 x pupils in 12 month programs.  49   APPENDIX III-C DESCRIPTION OF PUPIL COUNTS USED IN AID FORMULAS FOR THE 2004-05 SCHOOL YEAR I. Average Daily Attendance/Average Daily Membershipa A. Average Daily Attendance (ADA) is the average number of pupils present on each regular school day in a given period. The average is determined by dividing the total number of attendance days of all pupils by the number of days school was in session. Average Daily Membership (ADM) is a measure of enrollment. It is the total possible aggregate daily attendance of all pupils in the district divided by the days of session.  B.  II.

The 2003-04 TAPU is based on 2002-03 ADA, adjusted by the enrollment index (change between 2002-03 and 2003-04 enrollment). The 2002-03 TAPU is based on 2001-02 ADA, adjusted by the enrollment index (change between 2001-02 and 2002-03 enrollment). b  50   Total Aidable Pupil Units For Expense Additional Weightings Secondary (including PSENc but excluding students with disabilities (swd)in 1.7 & .9 public excess cost categories) PSEN K-12 (including swd) SWD in public schools for: 60% of school day (special class) 20% of school week (resource room) d Direct/Indirect Consultant Teacher Private School Summer/Extra School  Total Aidable Pupil Units For Payment  Total Wealth Pupil Units  Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance  .25  .25  .25  --  .25  .25  .25  --  1.70 .90 .90 -.12  ----.12  1.70 .90 .90 ---  ------  c  PSEN (Pupils with Special Educational Needs) are determined by multiplying district average daily attendance by the percentage of the student population falling below the State reference point on third and sixth grade reading and mathematics pupil evaluation program (PEP) tests administered in the Spring of 1985 and the Spring of 1986. Or five periods (at least 180 minutes) per week.  d  51   APPENDIX III-D STATE AID PAYMENT SCHEDULE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS Section 3609-a of the Education Law will govern the schedule of school district payments as well as the manner in which monthly aid payments are calculated. Section 3609-a includes computerized aids payable as General Support for Public Schools (GSPS) except for aids which are covered under the Section 3609-b (Excess Cost) payment schedule and Section 3609-d (BOCES Aid) payments as well as Textbook, Software and Library Materials Aids. Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will not be paid until June 2005. Small Cities Aid is covered by Section 3609-c. In addition, Section 3609-e of the Education Law governs the schedule of school district payments for School Tax Relief (STAR). This payment is intended to reimburse school districts for school property tax exemptions granted pursuant to Section 425 of the Real Property Tax Law. For GSPS aid payable in the 2004-05 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT456-1,"" which was released in January 2004 with the issuance of the 2004-05 Executive Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 2005. The payment schedule has several features: GSPS Aids   Lottery Aid will be paid in full on the first business day of September. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November. ""Fixed"" payments will be paid in the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's apportionments, after TRS payments, will be paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent by October 15, 18.75 percent by November 15 and 25.00 percent by December 15. ""Individualized"" payments will be calculated for the months of January through June. January through May payments are based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. The June payment is based on data available to the Commissioner as of May 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 2005. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31.      52     Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year will be paid to school districts on or before March 31 on a prorata basis using the districts' relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total monies designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the total monies designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies designated for March (if a negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General Support of Public Schools will be used. Any aid payable for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. In addition the total of such aid payable through June for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid cannot exceed the total of such aid as it appears on the computer listing ""BT456-1."" Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT456-1"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2005.      STAR Aid  STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies amounts payable under the STAR program to the Commissioner of Education and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. Commending in the 2003-04 school year, STAR reimbursements are governed by a formula designed to ensure that outstanding STAR balances do not exceed specified percentages of a district's property tax levy. Assuming timely filing of claims by districts, any STAR amounts that exceed 25% of a district's property tax levy will be paid in October. Remaining STAR amounts that exceed 20% of levy will be paid in November and STAR owed in excess of 15% of levy will be paid in December. The balance of STAR due to districts will be paid on the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2005. Payment amounts will be based on current data on file at the time of each payment through January. Current statutory provisions that authorize the Commissioner to withhold State aid payments from school districts that have not submitted enrollment and expenditure data on a timely basis shall not apply to STAR aid payments.       53   Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid reimbursement). Such State share monies will be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid reimbursement. Any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids will be paid in accordance with the schedule below. Total Excess Cost Aids payable to a district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT456-1"" which was released in January 2004 with the issuance of the 2004-05 Executive Budget.  The positive remainder of 25 percent of Excess Cost Aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November, 2004 will be paid on or before December 15.

BASIC OPERATING AID [Section 3602(12) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total - $5,928.6 Million) Basic Operating Aid is available to help each district meet its expenditures for general operation and maintenance of the school district. Included within operating expenditures are salaries of administrators, teachers and non-professionals, fringe benefits, utilities and maintenance of school facilities. Certain expenses are not included in the definition of operating expenses for purposes of Basic Operating Aid, primarily because these expenses are aided through other formulas or special aid programs. Examples of such expenses are: interfund transfers, transportation expenses, capital outlay and debt service, expenses for cafeteria, expenses to Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), tuition payments to other districts, and payments from funds received from the federal government. The State shares in a specified expense per pupil with local school districts through a sharing ratio formula. Aid is generated in inverse proportion to a district's wealth as measured by real property and adjusted gross income by applying a sharing ratio to the per-pupil ceiling amount. As a result, low wealth districts receive a relatively high amount of aid; high wealth districts receive a relatively low amount of aid. For 1999-00 the aidable per pupil expense ceiling consists of a fixed amount of $3,900 per pupil plus an additional variable amount equal to a percent of the difference between the district's 1997-98 approved operating expense per pupil (AOE/TAPU), not to exceed $8,000, and the fixed ceiling of $3,900. The percent adjustment used is also related to the district's wealth in terms of taxable real property within the district and income of district residents. The calculation of this percentage is explained later in this report under the subheading ""The Equalization of Operating Aid."" A minimum expense ceiling adjustment of 7.5 percent of the difference is guaranteed for all districts, but for poorer districts that operate kindergarten through grade 12 programs a larger percentage is provided. For an average wealth district spending $7,000 per pupil the aid ceiling would be $3,900 + [.075 * ($7,000 - $3,900)] = $4,132.50. This amount is then multiplied by a sharing ratio to determine the formula aid per pupil unit. For those districts in which the formula generates less than $400 per pupil unit, the statute guarantees $400 per pupil minimum aid, often referred to as the Flat Grant (see Table 1). Operating Aid is determined by multiplying aid per pupil unit, the amount computed in the formula or $400, by the total aidable pupil units (TAPU). Total Aidable Pupil Units: Total aidable pupil units is the sum of several pupil counts, each count being assigned a distinct weighting. Weightings are used as a means of reflecting the assumed average cost of educating a particular pupil category. These categories and weightings are further explained by the following: 1) Full Day K-12 Adjusted Average Daily Attendance (Adjusted ADA) (Weighting = 1.00): The average number of pupils present on each regular school day. This is an average determined by dividing the total number of attendance days of all pupils by the number of days school was in session and attendance was recorded.   3 Adjusted ADA also includes the equivalent attendance of students under the age of 21 not on a regular day school register in programs leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma, the enrollment of pupils with disabilities full time in BOCES programs, and the full-time-equivalent enrollment of resident pupils attending a charter school. 2) 1/2 Day K Adjusted Average Daily Attendance (Weighting = 0.50): An adjustment to average daily attendance is made by applying a .50 weighting to half day kindergarten attendance. With this adjustment for half-day kindergarten and full K-12 weighted at 1.00, the result is adjusted average daily attendance. 3) Pupils in Dual Enrollment with a Nonpublic School (Weighing = 1.00 x Fraction of Day in Public School Programs): The attendance of nonpublic school pupils in career education, gifted and talented, or special education programs of the public school district as authorized by Section 3602-c of the Education Law. Attendance is weighted by the fraction of the school day that the student is enrolled in the public school programs. 4) Pupils with Special Educational Needs (Additional Weighting = 0.25): The number of pupils with special educational needs attending the public schools of the district is determined by the percentage of pupils below minimum competence as measured by the third and sixth grade pupil evaluation program (PEP) tests in reading and mathematics. The average of the percentage of pupils in a district who scored below the State reference point on these third and sixth grade PEP Tests in 1984-85 and 1985-86 continues to be used to determine the number of pupils with special educational needs. This percentage is multiplied by the district's adjusted ADA to produce the number of pupils for weighting. The weighting for aid is .25; thus, the eligible pupils times .25 equals weighted PSEN pupils. Since this is an additional weighting, these pupils would also have been counted under average daily attendance. 5) Secondary School Pupils (Additional Weighting = 0.25): Eligible pupils in grades seven through twelve receive an additional weighting of .25. Eligible pupils for this weighting are defined as the number of students in average daily attendance in grades seven through twelve excluding any such students whose enrollment generates Public Excess Cost Aid. Thus, the eligible pupils times .25 equals additional secondary school weighting. 6) Summer Session Pupils (Weighting = 0.12): Summer session pupils are those pupils who attend approved programs of instruction operated by the district during the months of July and August, other than pupils with disabilities in twelve month programs. The full weighting of .12 is applicable if the student attends a total of 90 hours of class sessions during the summer. Adjustment in Computing Total Aidable Pupil Units Based on Enrollment Growth: For aids payable during 1999-00 attendance in the year prior to the base year forms the basis for determining total aidable pupil units (TAPU) for Basic Operating Aid. Base year is the school year prior to the current year. (Example: For the 1999-00 aid year, 1998-99 is the base year and 1997-98 is the year prior to the base year.) In computing TAPU for aids payable in 1999-00, such attendance in the year prior to the base year is multiplied by the ratio of base year (1998-99) enrollment to year prior to the base year (1997-98) enrollment. Selected TAPU: For the purposes of computing Basic Operating Aid, districts may use the total aidable pupil units as described above or the average of such number and the total aidable pupil units calculated for aid payable in the base year. The higher of these two figures is usually referred to as ""Selected TAPU.""  The Equalization of Operating Aid Based on Measures of District Wealth: Operating Aid is equalized or adjusted for district wealth. District wealth is measured by two variables. The first is the full value of taxable real    4 property per pupil unit within the district. The pupil count used is total wealth pupil units (TWPU), a measure of the weighted average daily attendance of resident pupils in a district. Full Value per TWPU for 1999-00 aid is: the 1996 Full Value divided by 1997-98 TWPU. The statewide average of full value per TWPU is $243,800 for purposes of 1999-00 aid. When the district's full value per pupil is divided by the statewide average, the quotient is called the pupil wealth ratio (PWR) of the district. A PWR value of 1.000 means that the district is of average wealth on this measure, while a district of less than average wealth would have a PWR less than 1.000 and a district of greater than average wealth would have a PWR greater than 1.000. Adjusted gross income per TWPU is the second measurement of wealth. The income data is based on personal income tax returns of district residents. For 1999-00 aid, 1996 adjusted gross income, as verified by a statewide income verification process conducted jointly by the Education Department, the Department of Taxation and Finance, and the Office of Real Property Services, is divided by 1997-98 TWPU. The statewide average of adjusted gross income per TWPU for 1999-00 aid is $91,700. When the district's adjusted gross income per pupil is divided by the statewide average, the quotient is called the alternate pupil wealth ratio (Alt-PWR) of the district. An Alt-PWR of 1.000 means that the district is of average wealth on this measure, while a district of less than average wealth would have an Alt-PWR less than 1.000 and a district of greater than average wealth would have an Alt-PWR greater than 1.000. When the PWR and the Alt-PWR of a district are averaged together, the resulting average wealth ratio is called the combined wealth ratio (CWR) of the district. CWR = .5 X District FV/TWPU $243,800 + .5 X District Income/TWPU $91,700  Note that a district of average wealth according to both property and income variables would have a combined wealth ratio of 1.000. Districts wealthier than the average would have a combined wealth ratio greater than 1.000 and poorer districts would have a ratio less than 1.000. The CWR is used to compute a State Sharing Ratio for Operating Aid using the highest ratio computed pursuant to the following formulas: 1. 2. 3. 4. 1.37 1.00 0.80 0.51 (1.23 (0.64 (0.39 (0.22 * * * * CWR) CWR) CWR) CWR) Poor Low High Rich District Average Wealth District Average Wealth District District  Maximum sharing ratio = 90%; minimum sharing ratio = 0% Examples: CWR CWR CWR CWR CWR  = = = = =  .30; .50; .75; 1.00; 1.80;  share share share share share  ratio ratio ratio ratio ratio  = = = = =  90.0% 75.5% 52.0% 41.0% 11.4%  (Formula (Formula (Formula (Formula (Formula  1) 1) 2) 3) 4)  Determination of Aidable Expense Per Pupil: For the purposes of calculating Operating Aid, an aidable per   5 pupil expense ceiling is calculated by adding to the basic ceiling of $3,900 a ceiling adjustment based on the 1997-98 approved operating expense per pupil of the district and the district's relative wealth. This ceiling adjustment is equal to the product of a ceiling adjustment factor and the difference of the district's approved operating expense per pupil (but not more than $8,000) minus $3,900. The minimum ceiling adjustment factor for all school districts is .075, but for districts operating a kindergarten through grade 12 program and a combined wealth ratio of less than 1.000, the ceiling adjustment factor equals the quotient of .075 divided by the CWR. Ceiling Adjustment = (AOE/TAPU* - $3,900) X (.075/CWR)** * ** May not exceed $8,000 for this calculation. May not be less than .075 for this calculation. Determination of Aid per Pupil: Oper. Aid Per Pupil* = Aidable Exp. Per Pupil X State Sharing Ratio * But not less than $400 *(Flat Grant). Determination of Basic Operating Aid: Oper. Aid Per Pupil X Selected TAPU B. TAX EQUALIZATION AID [Section 3602(16)(b) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $536.1 Million) Tax Equalization Aid is provided to those school districts that would have to levy a full value tax rate of $19.50 per $1000 of 1996 full value just to fund 1997-98 approved operating expenses (AOE). In comparison the State average school district property tax rate for all school purposes is $17.89 per $1000 of 1996 full value. The formula for Tax Equalization Aid is:  Aid = Sel. TAPU x AOE per pupil* -  Est. Revenue per pupil from $19.50 Rate  +  Oper. Aid per pupil  * For this calculation, AOE per pupil may not exceed $8,000. The following definitions apply to formula factors used in this equation: AOE per pupil - 1997-98 Approved Operating Expense per Pupil 1996 Full Value Est. Revenues per Pupil from $19.50 Rate = .01950 x 1997-98 TWPU C. TAX EFFORT AID [Section 3602(16)(c) of the Education Law (1999-00 Estimated Total = $195.0 Million)   6 Tax Effort Aid is provided to those school districts in which the 1996 property tax levy on residential properties (including condominiums), as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services, exceeds 3 percent of the school district's 1996 adjusted gross income of district residents. This aid is not available to school districts with a full value wealth ratio of 2.000 or greater. The formula for Tax Effort Aid is: Aid = $912.48 x TAPU x Tax Effort Factor Tax Effort Factor * [(1996 Res. Prop. Tax/1996 Income) - .03] .04 * May not exceed 1.00 or be less than 0. =  D. TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT [Section 3602(18) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $-393.5 Million) 1. Aid Minimum: For aid payable in 1999-00 the sum of the aids generated for Basic Operating Aid, Tax Equalization Aid and Tax Effort Aid may not be less than the sum of such aids plus transition received in 1998-99. 2. Aid Maximum: For aid payable in 1999-00 the sum of the aids generated for Basic Operating Aid, Tax Equalization Aid and Tax Effort Aid may not exceed the greater of: The sum of such aids and any transition adjustment payable in the 1998-99 school year multiplied by 1.0280 or The sum of such aids and any transition adjustment payable in the 1998-99 school year plus 7.80 percent of the positive difference of the sum of such formula aids calculated in the 1999-00 school year minus the sum of such aids and any transition adjustment payable in the 1998-99 school year. For the purposes of calculating the transition base used for calculation of such base resulting from aids payable in 1993-94 was calculation of such base resulting from aids payable in 1994-95 was from aids payable in 1995-96 was frozen as of July 1, 1999, and any 1997-98 and1998-99 will be frozen as of July 1, 2000. aids payable in 1999-00, any impact frozen as of July 1, 1996, any impact frozen as of July 1, 1998, any impact impact resulting from aids payable in upon the upon the resulting 1996-97,  E. DEDUCTION FOR THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SHARE OF EDUCATIONAL COSTS FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS [Section 4401(8) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $-18 Million) The educational costs for certain students are paid in the first instance by the State. These generally represent the educational costs for students under the care and custody of a State agency or for students with unique educational placements. In the year following the school year in which educational services are provided to these students at the State's expense, the State assesses a basic contribution in support of such expenditures from the school district of residence for the student. This basic contribution is defined in subdivision 8 of Section 4401 of the Education Law as an amount equal to the total base year property and nonproperty taxes of the school district divided by the base year   7 public school enrollment of the district. Any revenues received from the State under the School Tax Relief Program are considered property taxes for this purpose. The basic contribution is assessed for the following types of students:   students attending State-supported schools for the blind or deaf; students placed in a family home at board, an orphan asylum or other such institution who previously resided in a school for the mentally retarded operated by the State Office for Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities; students residing in a school for the mentally retarded operated by the State Office for Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities who receive educational services in a public school district or a BOCES; students residing in an intermediate care facility or an individualized residential alternative who receive educational services through the public school district of current location; students placed in a child care institution by the Family Court, the Department of Social Services or the State Division for Youth who receive educational services at the expense of a local social services district agency; students placed in a residential psychiatric treatment facility, a residential treatment facility or a child care institution who receive educational services at the expense of a local social services district agency or the New York State Office of Mental Health; students incarcerated in a county operated correctional facility who receive educational services through the public school district of current location; runaway or nonresident homeless students who receive educational services through the public school district of current location; and students placed by the school district in a Children's Residential Project (CRP) School on or after July 1, 1995. F. LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AID [Section 3602(22) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $69.3 million) School districts are entitled to receive aid for conducting programs for pupils with limited English proficiency th (those pupils from homes where other than English is spoken who score at or below the 40 percentile on a standardized test of English proficiency as approved by the Commissioner), or for pupils enrolled in such programs operated by a BOCES. The formula for computing this aid is: Selected Basic Operating Aid per pupil X .189 X the number of pupils with limited English proficiency in approved programs during the base year.              8  This aid is subject to an expenditure check, which may be waived by the Commissioner under certain conditions. Districts must receive prior program approval and report actual expenditures for the previous school year. Aids payable in the current year will be reduced by the amount of any unexpended aid revenues received by the district for the base year or by the amount of any unauthorized expenditures. G. GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAM AID [Section 3602(23) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $15.1 Million) To be eligible for Gifted and Talented Aid the school district must conduct a gifted and talented program during the current school year in accordance with a summary plan submitted to the Commissioner by December 1 as required by Section 142.4 of the Regulations of the Commissioner. The formula for computing Gifted and Talented Program Aid is: $196 X .03 X Adjusted Average Daily Attendance H. EXTRAORDINARY NEEDS AID [Section 3602(12)(e) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $665.9 Million) In addition to Basic Operating Aid, districts may be eligible for an additional operating aid based on the sum of certain measures of extraordinary needs. These measures are defined as the Extraordinary Needs Pupil Count and are:   the number of pupils receiving special educational programs for pupils with limited English proficiency during the 1998-99 school year; the number of pupils applying for free and reduced priced school lunches as calculated by multiplying the ratio of such applicants to enrollment in grades K-6 during the fall of 1997 by the 1998-99 K-12 public school enrollment of the school district; and a sparsity count for school districts operating grades K through 12 with less than 25 pupils per square mile equal to the product of 1998-99 K-12 public school enrollment and the quotient of 25 minus the district pupils per square mile divided by 58.    If a school district did not participate in the school lunch program in the fall of 1997, a pupil count based on the percentage of pupils performing below the State reference points on the Spring of 1997 third and sixth grade PEP tests in reading and mathematics multiplied by the 1998-99 K-12 enrollment of the school district may be used in lieu of the school lunch count.  The purpose of Extraordinary Needs Aid is to target additional funds to school districts to meet needs related to educating concentrations of extraordinary needs pupils and provides extra funding for those school districts with such concentrations in excess of 74.5 percent of enrollment. For this purpose a concentration percent is calculated by dividing the extraordinary needs pupil county by the 1998-99 K-12 public school enrollment of the district.   9 Calculation of Extraordinary Needs Aid (ENA): Aid equals the product of:      an extraordinary needs factor of 11 percent for all districts; a concentration factor of at least 1.00 for all districts but greater than 1.00 for school districts with concentrations of extraordinary needs pupils in excess of 74.5 percent of enrollment; the district's aidable per pupil expense ceiling used to calculate Basic Operating Aid; the district's extraordinary needs pupil count; and the extraordinary needs aid sharing ratio.  The extraordinary needs concentration factor, which cannot be less than one for any district is equal to:  1  +  Concentration % - 74.5 38.7  For aids payable in 1999-00 school districts may select the greater of the aids payable pursuant to these formulas or the Extraordinary Needs Aid calculated for the 1998-99 school year. The ENA sharing ratio is based solely on the income wealth ratio of the school district (not property wealth) and is calculated as follows: ENA Sharing Ratio = 1 - (.4 x Income Wealth Ratio) I. OPERATING STANDARDS AID [Section 3602(38) of the Education law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $102.2 Million) This aid is provided to fund services and expenses incurred by school districts in helping students improve achievement in order to meet the new high learning standards and assessments established by the Board of Regents. Funds may be used to support activities and programs in accordance with a district plan designed to assist students to achieve the new high learning standards through direct instructional services, appropriate professional development services for teachers, and the development and sharing of innovative educational practices.  The formula for computing the aid is: [$7.50 + ($61.50 X Sharing Ratio*)] X Adjusted Selected TAPU** * The sharing ratio = {1 - .66 X [.5 X Alt. Pupil Wealth Ratio + .5 X (1997-98 AOE/TAPU / 6,058)]}, but not less than .078.   10 ** The adjusted selected TAPU = Selected TAPU for Payment, adjusted for school districts with an extraordinary needs concentration % greater than 60% by multiplying Sel. TAPU by a factor of 1.26. J. EDUCATIONALLY RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES AID (ERSSA) [Section 3602(32) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $66.4 Million) This aid is intended to help defray costs of providing support services which will enable pupils to maintain their placement in a regular education program. Such support services may include psychological services, social work services, speech and language improvement services, curriculum and instructional modification, direct student support team services and non-career counseling services provided by qualified professional personnel. Services to qualified handicapped pupils under the American with Disabilities Act and any students with disabilities whose attendance does not generate any Excess Cost Aid are also included. Chapter 405 of the Laws of 1999 provides that Educationally Related Support Services provided under a cooperative service agreement with a BOCES in 1998-99 and thereafter shall no longer be eligible for BOCES Aid pursuant to Section 1950 of the Education Law. Pupils may be referred for such services by the school building administrator. Aid is calculated using a two-tier formula as follows: Tier I: $335.00 X ERSSA Aid Ratio X Selected TAPU X 9 percent ERSSA Aid Ratio = the greater of the Basic Operating Aid sharing ratio or .25 Tier II: $635.00 X Public Excess Cost Aid Ratio X Tier II Pupils*, but not less than $0. * Tier II pupils = .15 X Sel. TAPU X (Extraordinary Needs Concentration Percent - 60 percent)  K. REGULAR BUILDING AID [Section 3602(6) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $1,116.0 Million)* * Does not include additional aids payable for 10% Incentive Aid. Building Aid is available for expenses incurred in construction of new buildings, additions, alterations or modernization of district-owned buildings, for purchase of existing structures for school purposes, and for lease and installment purchase payments under certain circumstances.  Expenses for which Building Aid is available are: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) principal and interest payments for bonds, bond anticipation notes, and capital notes sold to finance approved building projects; capital expenditures from budgetary appropriations; expenditures from capital reserve funds; debt service payments on installment purchase contracts; and lease expenditures. Certain limitations are applied to principal and interest payments. These limitations   11 are explained below. Steps in computing Building Aid:    Building plans and specifications for the project must be approved by the Facilities Planning Unit of the State Education Department. The pupil capacity of the building is assigned to the project by the Facilities Planning Unit. Estimated construction costs and estimated incidental costs are determined. Construction costs are for major contracts (general construction, heating and ventilating, plumbing, and electrical), while incidental costs are for such items as site purchase, site development, original equipment, furnishings, machinery or apparatus, and professional fees. A maximum construction cost allowance for each building project is computed by multiplying a pupil construction cost allowance figure, adjusted for regional cost differences, by the assigned pupil capacity for the building. The pupil construction cost allowance is adjusted monthly, based upon an index which reflects changes in cost of labor and materials. The index available for the calendar month in which the construction contract is signed for a specific project is the index used. The actual construction cost allowance is the lesser of (1) the computed maximum described above or (2) the actual construction costs. The regional cost adjustment is established annually and is applied only to projects for which contracts are awarded on or after 7/1/98.  The maximum incidental cost allowance is 20 percent of the maximum construction cost allowance for K-6 buildings, and 25 percent of construction cost allowance for Grade 7-12 buildings and for special education space. The actual incidental cost allowance is the lesser of the computed maximum or actual incidental costs. If debt or obligations are used to finance a project, a bond percentage is computed. The bond percentage is derived from the ratio of total approved cost allowances to the total principal borrowed.      November 15th Reporting of BANS and New Debt Service: Aid on debt service payments (debt service equals the sum of principal and interest) and lease payments is generally paid in the current year. For aids payable on newly issued bonds or capital notes or on bond anticipation notes, however, current year aid will only be paid to the extent that current year debt service for such bonds or notes is reported to the Commissioner of Education prior to November 15 of the current year. Any debt service in excess of the amount reported on November 15 of the current year will not be aided until the following school year. Building Aid Calculation: State Aid is paid on a building project only up to the total approved cost allowance. Total approved cost   12 allowance is the sum of the construction cost allowance plus the incidental cost allowance. The Building Aid formula is: Building Aid = Approved Building Expense X Building Aid Ratio  Building Aid Ratio = 1.000 - 1996 FV/1997-98 RWADA* X .51 291,500 (State Average) * See Appendix A for a definition of RWADA Approved Building Expense = prior year capital outlay expenditures from budgetary appropriation or capital reserves, current year debt service times bond percentage and/or certain approved lease payments, plus prior year excess debt service on new bonds and/or capital notes and bond anticipation notes times bond percentage. Note that .51 is the local share for districts of average wealth (i.e., district average full value per pupil equals the State average ($291,500) so that District Average FV/RWADA/$291,500 = 1.000). For districts of average wealth the State share is .49. For wealthier districts the State share would be smaller, and for poorer districts the State share would be larger. For 1999-00 aid, a district may elect to use the current building aid ratio, or the building aid ratio computed for any of the years from 1981-82 through 1998-99 (whichever is highest). Districts reorganized on or after July 1, 1983 may use an aid ratio for 1981-82 or thereafter for any of the individual school districts which existed prior to the date of the reorganized school district. For aids payable in 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-00, however, any aid ratio used in this selection process as selected in a prior year will be as calculated by the Commissioner of Education as of July 1 of the third school year following the year in which such selected aid ratio was used to calculate aid. This means that for aids payable in 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-00 any aid ratio selected for aid payable in 1996-97 as now used in the selection process for these later aid years was frozen as of July 1, 1999. For all projects approved by the voters after June 30, 2000 districts will have the choice of the greater of the current year aid ratio or the selected aid ratio computed for use in 1999-2000 school year minus 10%. Limitation on Types of Aidable Obligations: Certain limitations are applied to Building Aid payable for principal and interest expenditures incurred in the financing of approved school construction projects as follows:  Bond Anticipation Notes (BANS): Approved debt service for BANS issued or reissued after July 1, 1996 but prior to the issuance of a certificate of substantial completion, will equal: 1) interest expense on such notes issued after July 1, 1996 but prior to the date of substantial completion of the construction project being funded; and 2) principal expense, not exceeding the minimum principal payment required under the Local Finance Law. Bonds, Capital Notes or Other Long-Term Local Obligation: To be eligible for Building Aid, any bond,     13 capital note or other long-term obligation issued on or after August 1, 1996 (or on or after November 15, 1996, or the last date upon which such an obligation can be issued by a small city school district without voter approval, whichever occurs first) shall: 1) provide for substantially level debt service or principal; 2) be amortized for a period of at least 15 years, including any period of amortization of related BANS, if used to finance new construction or purchase of existing facilities; and 3) be amortized for a period of at least 10 years, including any period of amortization of related BANS, if used to finance reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of existing facilities.  If a school district issues obligations that do not satisfy the above criteria for aid, the Commissioner of Education will calculate an appropriate assumed amortization of approved project costs, less any previously aided principal expense, for the specified minimum number of years using an interest rate for the month in which a general construction contract is awarded for the project as calculated from a nationally recognized and accepted index of municipal bond yields. The assumed amortization commences with the date of awarding a general construction contract or when it is determined that an assumed amortization will be used for aid purposes, whichever is later. Aid will then be calculated based on the assumed debt service payable each year under the assumed amortization. Chapter 436 of the Laws of 1997 provides that small city school districts, and other school districts in certain cases, may elect to receive Building Aid based on an assumed amortization of approved project costs even if the obligation issued to finance construction satisfies all criteria for aid on actual debt service. Non-city school districts with bond anticipation notes eligible for Building Aid in 1996-97 may elect to receive 1996-97 and later aid payments for the school construction funded with such notes based on an assumed amortization of any previously unaided principal related to the approved costs of such construction. Similarly, small city school districts may elect to receive 1996-97 and later Building Aid for any approved building project based on an assumed amortization of any previously unaided principal related to such approved project costs. This election must be conveyed to the Commissioner of Education by November 15, 1997, or upon submission of the building project to the Commissioner for approval, whichever occurs later.      Those school districts electing an assumed amortization under this provision can reduce local debt service expense by retiring the locally funded portion of debt related to approved school construction costs and only amortizing the State funded portion of such costs. Since Building Aid would be calculated on an assumed amortization of the total approved costs, including both local and State funded portions, the school district's annual debt service expense for actual bonds issued to finance the State funded portion will generally be equaled by the annual Building Aid payments received under the assumed amortization.  Building Aid Payable for Energy Performance Contracts: In order to receive Building Aid on energy performance contracts, the estimated Building Aid payable must be excluded in determining the cost savings under the contract and the contractor must guarantee recovery of the contract costs by the school district from energy savings realized during the term of the contract which cannot exceed 18 years. All requirements applied to aid on debt service related to energy performance contracts,   14 however, will be based on a minimum amortization period equal to the term of the contract, which may be shorter than the normally required 10 years for reconstruction or 15 years for new construction. Building Aid for Items with a Period of Probable Usefulness of Less than 10 Years: Minimum Period of Amortization Related to Building Acquisitions with a Period of Probable Usefulness of less than 10 acquisition of computer equipment and other objects with a period if otherwise approved for Building Aid purposes, may be based on probable usefulness. Regional Cost Adjustment: For approved building projects with a general construction contract awarded on or after July 1, 1998, the construction cost allowance will be adjusted by a factor reflecting regional differences in labor market composite wage rates established by the Commissioner of Labor each year. The adjustment will result in increased cost allowances for school districts in high cost areas of the State, but the index cannot be less than one so that the adjustment cannot be negative for districts in other areas of the State. In calculating Building Aid actual costs claimed for aid may not exceed the cost allowance. Aid on Actual Debt Service for Certain years: Actual debt service expenditures for of probable usefulness of less than ten years, an amortization period equal to the period of  L. ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE BUILDING AID [Section 3602(6)(b)(2) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $32.5 Million) An additional apportionment of 10 percent of approved building expenses is available for school building projects approved by the voters of the school district on or after July 1, 1998. The sum of this additional aid plus regular Building Aid and Reorganization Incentive Building Aid, however, cannot exceed 95 percent of approved building expenses. All school districts, including those with a Building Aid ratio of zero, benefit from the additional 10 percent aid formula. Please note that for projects that are not approved by the voters, such as energy performance contracts, this incentive aid is not payable.  M. RESCUE AID [Section 3641(10) of the Education Law] (1999-2000 through 2001-2002 Estimated 3 Year Total = $145 Million) RESCUE Aid (Rebuilding Schools to Uphold Education) is available for eligible school construction projects for the design, planning, construction, acquisition, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of a public school building used primarily for instruction that is an accessibility project, an educational technology project, a health and safety project, and/or a physical capacity expansion project. These projects must be approved by the voters on or after July 1, 1998. Projects that meet the above criteria must also meet one or more of the following requirements:   15    be approved by the voters by January 15, 2000; have a Letter of Intent on file with Education Department by August 1, 1999; or be a priority project to address health and safety of students for which a Letter of Intent is filed with the Education Department by July 1, 2000.  The allocation of RESCUE is based on a district's ratio of 1998-99 resident public and nonpublic enrollment to State total resident enrollment of 3,326,947 truncated to six decimals. The resulting ratio is multiplied by $145,000,000 to arrive at the districts allocation with a guaranteed minimum of $20,000. All allocations are prorated to remain within the $145,000,000 appropriation. RESCUE allocations may be used in conjunction with other building aids to offset a districts local share within the following limitations:  If a districts Building Aid ratio plus the 10% Additional Incentive Aid (Enhanced Building Aid Ratio) is less than 90% then the sum of all Building Aid, including the Additional Incentive Aid and Reorganization Incentive Aid, plus the RESCUE Funding may not exceed 95% of total approved project costs. If a districts Enhanced Building Aid ratio is equal to or greater than 90% then the sum of all Building Aids plus the RESCUE funding may not exceed 98% of total approved project costs. RESCUE allocations may be applied toward the principal payment on a bond, but not the interest payment. N. MINOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR AID [Section 3602(6-d) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $50 Million) Additional funding is provided for minor maintenance and repair of school facilities in the 1999-00 school year. This funding will be calculated and distributed to school districts based on such factors as age of facilities and long term enrollment growth in a manner similar to the previously existing Extraordinary School Capital Needs Aid Program. $50 million in aid is anticipated for each of the school years of 1998-99 through 2000-01 ($16,670,000 for districts other than New York City and $33,370,000 for New York City Public Schools) and $80 million is anticipated for 2001-02 ($26,672,000 for districts other than New York City and $53,328,000 for New York City Public Schools). This aid is available for reimbursement of expenses for minor repair and improvement activities performed to remedy existing minor maintenance and repair deficiencies of instructional school facilities or to mitigate the need for extensive capital renovation and rehabilitation for such buildings in the future. Expenditures funded with Minor Maintenance and Repair Aid should be recorded in the Special Aid Fund (F3289). The school district must also demonstrate that General Fund expenditures during the 1999-00 school year for maintenance of school facilities as recorded in account code A1621 equals or exceeds the 1997-98 school year appropriations for maintenance of school facilities as appropriated in account code A1621, or the amount of any deficiency will be recovered from aids payable in a subsequent school year. O. REORGANIZATION INCENTIVE AID     16 [Section 3602(14) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $42.9 Million) Two forms of incentive aid to encourage school district reorganizations into more effective and efficient units are available for the 1999-00 school year, and a shared services incentive aid is available to reward districts that increase cost-effectiveness of programs through collaborative activities with other districts, BOCES, counties, other municipalities or a human services agency such as a county department of social services. 1. REORGANIZATION INCENTIVE OPERATING AID [Section 3602(14) of the Education Law] ($23.5 Million) For school districts which reorganize, Incentive Operating Aid is available for 14 years beginning with the first school year of operation as a reorganized district. For school districts which reorganize on or after July 1, 1983 but before July 1, 1992, Incentive Operating Aid for the first five years equals 20 percent of Basic Operating Aid, and for the next nine years the percentage of such operating aid decreases 2 percent per year. For school districts which reorganize on or after July 1, 1992, Incentive Operating Aid for the first five years equals 40 percent of Basic Operating Aid, and for the next nine years the percentage of such operating aid decreases 4 percent per year. The sum of Basic Operating Aid and Incentive Operating Aid may not exceed 95 percent of the district's Approved Operating Expense used for aid calculations in the current school year. 2. REORGANIZATION INCENTIVE BUILDING AID [Section 3602(14) of the Education Law] ($19.4 Million) Incentive Building Aid is 25 percent of the Building Aid otherwise paid on an approved building project for districts which reorganized prior to July 1, 1983. Aid is paid on such projects for which the general construction contract is signed prior to July 1, 2000. For school districts which reorganized on or after July 1, 1983, Incentive Building Aid is 30 percent of the Building Aid otherwise paid on an approved building project. Aid is paid on such projects for which the general construction contract is signed prior to July 1, 2000 or within 10 years from the effective date of the reorganization, whichever is later. In no case, however, may the sum of regular Building Aid (including the 10% Incentive Aid) plus Incentive Building Aid exceed 95 percent of approved building expenditures.  3. SHARED SERVICES SAVINGS INCENTIVE [Section 3602(14)(i) of the Education Law] ($0.2 Million) A Shared Services Savings Incentive Aid is provided to school districts and BOCES that creatively manage shared services to decrease costs to taxpayers and the State. Such shared programs may involve collaboration with a county, other municipalities or a human services agency such as a county department of social services. Decreased expenditures resulting from increased efficiency of shared programs may result in savings to the district or BOCES, which often result in decreased State Aid expenditures. The purpose of this program is to support such initiatives and to provide a fiscal reward to those whose creativity and management capabilities can carry out these practices. In effect, it ""shares the State's savings"" that result from the initiative with the participating public school district(s) and/or BOCES, so that all parties benefit from the increased efficiencies.   17 Shared Services Savings Incentive awards are available for a school district, a group of school districts and/or a BOCES which have demonstrated savings to the State. Such shared services might result from collaboration regarding the provision of transportation services, for example. Each participating school district or BOCES must provide a board resolution in support of the plan, and a single school district must be designated as the lead agency for purposes of the grant. Each application will be reviewed to determine the overall level of savings to the State at a minimum total level of $200,000 over more than one year. Generally, savings to the State will not be achieved until the year after the savings are realized by the district(s) and/or BOCES. The amount of the award under this program is 50 percent of the total annual savings to the State for each year that at least a $100,000 savings to the State can be demonstrated for up to a maximum of five years. To be eligible for the Shared Services Savings Incentive a proposal must satisfy the following criteria: 1) The proposal must represent savings to the State resulting from the sharing of previously unshared activities undertaken with one or more other school districts, a BOCES, a county or other municipality, or a human services agency, such as a county department of social services. The proposal must document savings using baseline data on the cost of the previously unshared service to the participating agencies for the two years prior to the initiation of the shared activity and corresponding State Aid payable in the base year compared to an estimate of the State Aid that would have been payable in the current year in the absence of sharing.  2)  P. TRANSPORTATION AID [Section 3602(7) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $828.1 Million) Transportation Aid is based on a district's approved transportation expenses. Approved transportation expenses are generally those made in transporting all pupils to and from school once daily and between the school attended and Boards of Cooperative Educational Services, or in transporting pupils to approved shared programs at other school districts or occupational education programs within a district. They include expenditures for the operation of a school district transportation supervisor's office, and for operation of district-owned buses, contract buses, and public service vehicles (subway included).  The process of sorting expenditures is summarized as follows: a. Determine those transportation expenses which are deducted from total operating expenditures to insure they do not generate any other aid; Determine which of the transportation expenses can be used as approved transportation expenses to generate Transportation Aid.  b.  The transportation expenses approved for Transportation Aid include only those incurred in transporting allowable pupils on approved buses, over approved routes. A pupil decimal based on an historical record of pupils is used as a substitute for the actual deductible cost of non-allowable pupil miles and also is applied to purchase of buses. This decimal must be recomputed every three years, or when transportation policy revisions require a recalculation. Any pupil attending a universal prekindergarten program pursuant to Section 3602-e of the Education Law who are   18 transported using available vacant seats on existing bus routes, however, will not result in any increase in the nonallowable pupil deduction. Examples of non-allowable pupils are: non-disabled pupils who live 1 1/2 miles or less from the school attended, and non-disabled pupils transported to public schools outside the district of residence when classes are maintained by the district of residence. Expenditures for lunch, cannot be used to expenses for such trips transport pupils who stay transportation for summer school, field trips, athletic trips, excursions, and noon trips for generate Transportation Aid and are, therefore, part of a district's operating expenses. The are pro-rated on the basis of route mileage. Expenditures for operating late bus trips to late for club or athletic activities are aidable approved transportation expenses.  Transportation contracts must be filed with the Education Department within 120 days of start of service in order to generate full Transportation Aid. Only contract expenditures up to the amount stipulated in the contract, and within reasonable cost guidelines developed by the State Education Department, may be allowed for aid purposes. Section 3625(1) of the Education Law also requires that every transportation contract be submitted to the superintendent of schools for approval before such contract is filed with the Department. District-operated transportation expense includes bus purchase expenditures, supplies and materials, equipment, bus driver training and salaries related to transportation, except salaries for assistant drivers on buses transporting non-disabled pupils. Transportation Aid payable for bus purchases is limited to such purchases budgeted by the school district and reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15 of the base year. Any bus purchase that is budgeted or reported to the Commissioner after this date, will not be aided until the second year after the year of purchase. Prior approval is required for computerized bus routing expenses greater than $4,999, two-way radio base stations and computer equipment expenses to be eligible for aid. The formula for calculating Transportation Aid is: Approved Transportation Expenses x [Selected Sharing Ratio + Sparsity Factor] Districts may select the higher of the following three sharing ratios for use in the formula: (Cities with a population of more than one million may not use Sharing Ratio 3) 1) Sharing Ratio 1 = 1.263 X Basic Operating Aid Sharing Ratio  2)  Sharing Ratio 2 = 1.010  -  District FV/RWADA $291,500 (State Average)  X .460  3)  Sharing Ratio 3 = 1.010  -  District FV/RPNP* $250,200 (State Average)  X .460  * Resident Public and Nonpublic Enrollment   19 The sparsity factor (minimum = 0) is calculated as follows and is added to the selected sharing ratio to determine the State Share Ratio for Transportation Aid: 21.000 - Fall 1997 Enrollment per Square Mile 317.88  A minimum State share ratio of 6.5 percent is guaranteed, and the aid ratio may not exceed a maximum of 90 percent. Q. SPECIAL SERVICES AID FOR FIVE LARGE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS (Over 125,000 Population) [Section 3602(17) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $143.8 Million) These special aids are provided to the five large city school districts of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and New York City in lieu of aid payable to other school districts for career education and administrative uses of technology purchased as shared services and aided through Boards of Cooperative Educational Services. The five large city school districts may not claim BOCES Aid for such services since they cannot be components of a BOCES. 1. AID FOR CAREER EDUCATION [Section 3602(17)(b) of the Education Law] ($104.0 Million) The city school districts having a population in excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand (New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers) are entitled to aid for certain career education pupils in grades 10-12. An amount for each pupil is arrived at by multiplying the career education aid ratio by the amount of $3,720. Thus, the formula is: $3,720 X Career Education Aid Ratio X 1998-99 Weighted Career Education Pupils for such programs = Career Education Aid. Weighted pupils is defined as the sum of the attendance of students in grades 10-12 in career education sequences in trade, industrial, technical, agricultural or health programs plus .16 multiplied by the attendance of students in grades 10-12 in career education sequences in business and marketing. The aid ratio is obtained as follows: 1.000 - (CWR X .59) = Aid Ratio (minimum aid ratio = .360) The CWR wealth measure is that used for Basic Operating Aid. Districts which do not spend local funds for this program in 1999-00 in excess of the local funds spent in 199899 will have the difference deducted from their State Aid.  2. COMPUTER ADMINISTRATION AID [Section 3602(17)(c) of the Education Law] ($39.8 Million) The large city school districts are entitled to aid for approved expenses for data processing pursuant to   20 Regulations of the Commissioner. The formula for this aid is: Aid Ratio X the lesser of: Approved Expenses or $62.30 X the 1998 Fall Enrollment of the district in grades K-12. The aid ratio is obtained as follows: 1.000 - (CWR X .51) = Aid Ratio (minimum aid ratio = .300) R. AIDS FOR EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY 1. INSTRUCTIONAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT AID [Section 3602(26) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $18.1 Million) School districts are eligible for aid for the purchase or lease of micro and/or mini computer equipment or terminals for instructional purposes. For 1999-00, aid is equal to the lesser of the approved expenditures or $12.70 X the RWADA aid ratio for the current year X selected TAPU used in calculating Basic Operating Aid. Approved expenses are those incurred in the base year as reported on the Annual Financial Report of the school district. Twenty percent of the expenditures may be for hardware repair and/or staff development related to use of computer technology. Expenditures up to the amount of maximum aid may be included by the board of education in a contingency budget for 1999-00. The RWADA aid ratio = 1.000  (1996 actual valuation/1997-98 RWADA) X .51 $291,500  For aids payable in 1999-00 and beyond the calculated formula amount is enriched as follows: SCHOOL YEAR 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Beyond FORMULA $12.70 X RWADA Aid Ratio X Selected TAPU $19.25 X RWADA Aid Ratio X Selected TAPU $32.35 X RWADA Aid Ratio X Selected TAPU  2. AID FOR COMPUTER SOFTWARE PURCHASES [Section 751 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $18.5 Million) Each public school district may claim an apportionment of Computer Software Aid in an amount equal to the product of $7.55 multiplied by the number of pupils attending schools within the public school district's boundaries and enrolled during the 1998-99 (base) school year in grades K-12 in a public or nonpublic school. Each public school district is required to use such funds to purchase and loan computer software for instructional   21 purposes on an equitable basis to both public and nonpublic school students attending schools within the district's boundaries during the 1999-00 (current school year). Aid is equal to the lesser of the maximum apportionment of $7.55 per pupil or the actual expenditures incurred by the school district for software purchases during 1998-99 as reported on the Annual Financial Report of the school district. For aids payable in 1999-00 and beyond the aid per pupil is enriched as follows: SCHOOL YEAR 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Thereafter AID PER PUPIL $ 7.55 $14.98 $23.90  The amount of aid calculated pursuant to this formula is considered final and not subject to change after April 30 of the school year for which such aid is payable. 3. BUILDING AID FOR COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY [Section 3602(6) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid is Included in Building Aid.) Computer hardware purchase and installation, including conduits, wiring and powering and testing of hardware installations, are eligible for Building Aid even if the cost is less than $10,000. Such installations must, however, be approved by the Commissioner as an approved school construction project. Computer elements eligible for aid are:       Incidental costs for computer equipment installed as original equipment in a new building or a new addition. Approved computer classrooms in new buildings/additions, or alterations to an existing classroom to create a new computer classroom.  Incidental costs for original purchase and installation of hardware (including computer hardware) Conduit, wiring, and powering and testing of hardware installations. Building wide and campus wide local area network (LAN) systems wiring and in-building elements of other wide area networks (WAN): Original purchase and installation of conduit, wiring, and powering and testing of hardware installations including network server and operating system software.  The following elements are ineligible for Building Aid:  Individual computer workstation hardware not located in a computer classroom unless claimed as incidental costs as part of the original furnishings and equipment for a new building or new addition.   22    All cost for software purchase, including application software costs, and costs for installation of software (other than installation of basic operating systems software required for hardware testing). All cost associated with lease or purchase of wide area network hardware (leased lines, fiber optic cable, etc.) not located on district property. Up-grade of existing LAN or WAN equipment beyond that necessary to interface with new computer classroom installations. 4. AID FOR INSTRUCTIONAL COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY SERVICES PURCHASED AS A SHARED SERVICE THROUGH A BOARD OF COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES [Section 1950(5) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid is Included in BOCES Aid.) Expenditures by a component school district of a board of cooperative educational services for shared instructional computer technology services purchased through the BOCES pursuant to a multi year contract, including BOCES owned computer hardware and software used by the school district to access the service, may be eligible for BOCES Shared Services Aid as described in Section U(1) of this manual. The component school district must be able to demonstrate, however, that expenditures incurred pursuant to purchase and/or installation contracts entered into on or after July 15, 2000 for the following categories of instructional and noninstructional technology purchases and/or installation would be more cost effective than would otherwise be possible if such services were to be purchased without the involvement of a board of cooperative educational services.       Computer equipment Conduits Wiring Powering and testing of hardware installations All costs associated with lease or purchase of local or wide area network hardware located on district property Incidental costs for original purchase and installation of hardware, including installation of basic operating systems software required for hardware testing.  5. AID FOR INSTRUCTIONAL COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY [Section 3602(26-a) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $25.0 Million) School districts may claim aid under this formula for the purchase, lease-purchase and/or installation of instructional computer technology equipment that is not eligible for Building Aid or claimed for aid under one of the other technology aids described above. Aidable expenditures may include the original purchase, leasepurchase and/or installation of hardware and vendor installed software for deployment in classrooms or libraries. Aidable expenditures may also include the costs of an extended maintenance contract for instructional computer technology equipment or network systems so acquired for the period of probable usefulness of such equipment or systems and to the extent that such costs would be allowable under a state contract. Current year debt service   23 expenses and obligations due under a lease-purchase agreement executed in a prior year for instructional computer technology equipment aided pursuant to this formula are considered ordinary contingent expenses of the school district. In order to claim aid for eligible expenditures school districts must develop and maintain a plan for use of instructional computer technology equipment as prescribed by the Commissioner of Education, including provisions for maintenance and repair and for staff development in the use of technology. Such plan may provide for the district's participation in the universal service discount program of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Federal Technology Literacy Challenge Program. Aid received pursuant to this formula must also be used in a manner that is consistent with the district's long-term facilities plan and with building-level, district-wide and, where applicable, regional instructional and technology plans. The formula for calculating Aid for Instructional Computer Technology is: Approved expenditures = base year capital outlays from budgetary appropriations or reserves and current year expenditures for debt service or lease purchase. Instructional Computer Technology Aid Ratio = the greater of:    the school district's selected Building Aid Ratio, a Millage Ratio equal to [1.000  (.008/the school districts 1998-99 property and nonproperty tax levy divided by the 1996 full value expressed in mills)], or [1.000  (.003/ full value tax rate )] for central high school districts and their components, or a minimum aid ratio of .360.  For the purposes of calculating a millage ratio, the five dependent city school districts use the tax rate computed pursuant to Section 3602(31-a)(a)(7) of the Education Law. Aid* = Approved Expenditures X Aid Ratio * Note: Total statewide aid is limited by the authorized statewide allocation, which is $25,000,000 for aids payable in 1999-00, $57,000,000 for aids payable in 2000-01, and $91,000,000 for aids payable in 2001-02 and thereafter. If school district claims exceed the authorized amount in any year, each district's aid will equal the same proportion of the total statewide authorized amount as its claim represents of the total statewide claimed amount. S. URBAN-SUBURBAN TRANSFER AID [Section 3602(36) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $.67 Million) Districts which receive pupils from another district according to an approved program for reducing racial isolation are eligible for an additional apportionment. To the extent that these transfer pupils do not generate any actual increase in aids for the district because of the aid minimum guaranteed under the Transition Adjustment, an additional apportionment is generated equal to the number of transfer pupils that do not generate such an actual aid increase multiplied by the Basic Operating Aid per pupil. This additional apportionment may also be increased for a receiving district by an aid differential factor if the   24 district receiving the transferred pupils receives less than the district sending the pupils in terms of the sum per pupil of the formula aids limited by the Transition Adjustment. The formula for this additional aid differential apportionment is the product of the transfer pupils received from the sending district multiplied by the positive difference between per pupil aids payable to the sending district minus such aids payable to the receiving district. For 1999-00 Urban-Suburban Transfer Aid is limited to eligible school districts participating in approved programs in the Rochester area. T. TUITION ADJUSTMENT AID [Section 3602(2)(g) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $1.2 Million) A school district which maintains an elementary school, but does for the education of secondary students in another school district with a Tuition Adjustment Aid. This aid equals the difference between the Basic such secondary students if they were educated in the home district and the such students in the wealthier, receiving district. not operate a K-12 program, and contracts higher combined wealth ratio, may claim Operating Aid that would be generated by Basic Operating Aid actually generated by  U. 1999-00 GROWTH AID [Section 3602(13) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $22.0 Million) A district experiencing growth in public school enrollment in October 1999 (BEDS Enrollment Data) compared to reported 1998 Fall public school enrollment, may receive a supplement to its Basic Operating Aid in the form of 1999-00 Growth Aid. For this purpose, the enrollment of resident pupils in a charter school is added to the public school enrollment of the district. This aid is to compensate for an assumed increase in expenditures, between the base year and the current year, resulting from an increase in enrollment. Growth Aid is a percentage of Basic Operating Aid. The percentage used is the percentage increase, in excess of .4 percent, by which enrollment for the current year exceeds enrollment for the base year. To be eligible for Growth Aid, however, a district must demonstrate growth in excess of .4 percent (.004).  1999-00 Growth Aid will be paid in June 2000, but this payment will be limited to the lesser of estimates of growth as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900"", which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 1999-00 State Aid to Localities Budget, or the actual report of growth provided to the Commissioner by the district and by charter schools educating district residents on Basic Educational Data reports in the Fall of 1999. Any unpaid excess Growth Aid claimed will be paid on or after September 1, 2000. V. EXCESS COST AIDS RELATED TO EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH ARE PAID IN CONJUNCTION WITH FEDERAL MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS 1. EXCESS COST AID FOR PUPILS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AND BOCES PLACEMENTS [Section 3602(19) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $1,639.2 Million)* * Note: Total includes subtotals below:   25 a. REGULAR PUBLIC EXCESS COST AID [Section 3602(19)(4) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $1,395.3 Million)* Public Excess Cost Aid is available to school districts for certain programs of special education in public school districts, charter schools or BOCES serving students with disabilities who have been found by a Committee on Special Education to require placement in these programs. Aid is available based on the full-time equivalent enrollment of students weighted according to the following categories: (1) The enrollment of students who have been determined by a Committee on Special Education either to require placement for 60 percent or more of the school day in a special class, or to require home or hospital instruction for a period of more than 60 days, or to require special services or programs for 60 percent or more of the school day. (For aids payable in 1999-00 the weighting for these pupils is 1.7, for aids payable in 2000-01 the weighting will be 1.68, and for aids payable in 2001-02 the weighting will be 1.65.) The enrollment of students who have been determined by a Committee on Special Education to require placement for a) at least 20 percent of the school week but less than 60 percent of the school day, in a resource room, or who require special services or programs for at least 20 percent of the school week but less than 60 percent of the school day; or b), for students in grades 7-12 or in a school for grades 46 that operates on a period basis, the equivalent of 5 periods per week, but not less than 180 minutes, of resource room or other special services or programs. (The weighting for these pupils is 0.90.) The enrollment of students who have been determined by a Committee on Special Education to require direct or indirect consultant teacher services at least 2 hours per week. (The weighting for these pupils is 0.90.)  (2)  (3)  The formula for computing Public Excess Cost Aid is: 1997-98 Approved Operating Expense per TAPU X Public Excess Cost Aid Ratio X 1998-99 Resident Weighted Students With Disabilities (including Weighted Dual Enrolled Students with Disabilities and Weighted Charter School Students with Disabilities). The aidable expenditures are the year prior to the base year Approved Operating Expense per TAPU for expense (1997-98 Approved Operating Expense per 1997-98 TAPU is used for aids payable in 1999-00). TAPU for expense includes the additional weightings for students with disabilities as described above. This expense per TAPU cannot be less than $2,000 nor more than the greater of $7,110 or the statewide average expense per pupil (for aid payable in 1999-00, $6,250). The Public Excess Cost Aid ratio is computed as follows: Aid Ratio = 1.000 - (CWR X .51)   26 The State share is 49 percent for the district of average wealth, with poorer districts receiving a greater share and richer districts a lesser share, but not less than a .250 minimum aid ratio. For example, a district whose approved operating expense per pupil unit = $5500, whose Public Excess Cost Aid ratio = .53 (i.e., a district somewhat poorer than average) and whose resident weighted pupils with disabilities count = 30.5 generates Public Excess Cost Aid as follows: $5500 x .53 x 30.5 = $88,908. b. DECLASSIFICATION SUPPORT SERVICES AID [Section 3602(19)(7) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $20.7 Million)* This aid is intended to help defray costs of providing support for teachers and pupils for the first year in which a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time general education program. Such services are defined in regulations and may include -For pupils: Psychological, social work, speech and language services, and noncareer counseling;  For teachers: Aides and consultation with appropriate personnel Services must be identified and recommended by the Committee on Special Education, and aid is available to districts only; services are not eligible for BOCES Aid. The formula for Declassification Support Services Aid is: Public Excess Cost Aid Per Pupil X .50 X Number of Pupils (Full Time Equivalent Enrollment during 1998-99) Aid is based on pupils served in the base year.  c. HIGH COST PUBLIC EXCESS COST AID [Section 3602(19)(5) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $166.2 Million)* A school district having a resident student with a disability for whom special education costs, as approved by a Committee on Special Education, exceed the lesser of: 1) $10,000, or 2) four times the 1997-98 approved operating expense per pupil without limits, may also receive an additional amount of aid defined as High Cost Aid. The district must file with the Education Department via the STAC System for payment of High Cost Aid. The formula for computing High Cost Aid is: High Cost Aid = [Annualized Educational Cost - (3 X 1997-98 Approved Operating Expense per TAPU)] X Excess Cost Aid Ratio X Full-Time-Equivalent Enrollment during 1998-99 of each High Cost Student In practice this formula results in only those pupils with annualized costs in excess of the greater of $10,000 or   27 3 X AOE/TAPU being eligible for the High Cost Aid. d. PUBLIC EXCESS COST AID SAVE HARMLESS [Section 3602(19)(6) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $57.0 Million)* For aids payable in 1999-00, a district may not receive less aid for the combination of Regular Public Excess Cost Aid, Declassification Support Services Aid (DSSA) and High Cost Aid than it received for the same combination of aids plus any save harmless aid paid in 1998-99. For aids payable in 2000-01, a district may not receive less aid for the combination of Regular Public Excess Cost Aid, Declassification Support Services Aid (DSSA) and High Cost Aid than the product of .991 and the sum of such aids received plus any save harmless aid paid in 1999-00. For aids payable in 2001-02, a district may not receive less aid for the combination of Regular Public Excess Cost Aid, Declassification Support Services Aid (DSSA) and High Cost Aid than the product of .9913 and the sum of such aids received plus any save harmless aid paid in 2000-01. e. INTEGRATED SETTINGS EXCESS COST AID [Section 3602(19)(1)(b-1) of the Education Law, as added by Chapter 405 of the Laws of 1999] (For aids payable in 2000-01 and 2001-02) For aids payable in 2000-01 and 2001-02, an additional Integrated Settings Excess Cost Aid will be apportioned to school districts for students with disabilities who have been determined by a Committee on Special Education to require special services or programs for 60 percent or more of the school day, and who receive special services or programs for 60 percent or more of the school day in a general education classroom. Only those students with disabilities receiving special services or programs for 60% or more of the school day in a general education classroom with non-disabled students qualify for this new aid. For example, a student may receive special services or programs in a separate setting (such as a pull-out service) as long as the student receives additional special services or programs for a total of 60% or more of the school day in the general education classroom. In addition to the Excess Cost Aids generated by such students as described above, an additional Integrated Settings Excess Cost Aid will be payable. Special education programs and services that may be counted in determining whether a student is receiving special education programs or services for 60% or more of the school day in the general education classroom setting include:       special educational services provided to the identified student by a special education teacher, related service provider, or special education paraprofessional in a general education classroom ; related services provided in the general education classroom; team-teaching where the special educator teaches in the general education classroom with the general education teacher; shared teaching when a group of special education teachers are providing instruction in a general education classroom with no separation of disabled students from their nondisabled peers; resource room services provided in the general education classroom; direct consultant teacher services within the general education classroom; (If claimed here, cannot be   28    claimed for consultant teacher aid.) indirect services by the consultant teacher to the general education classroom teacher for program planning in the general education environment for a specific student; special education paraprofessional support in general education classroom (e.g., health paraprofessional, behavioral support); and instructional lunch, if on the IEP, and the instructional lunch occurs in the same setting as nondisabled children.  The formula for this additional Integrated Settings Excess Cost Aid is: Public Excess Cost Aid Per Pupil X .50 X FTE of Qualifying Pupils in the Base Year . On or before March 15, 2002, the Commissioner will analyze the fiscal impact on the Public Excess Cost Aid formulas of this new additional Integrated Settings Excess Cost Aid and report his findings. 2. EXCESS COST AID FOR PUPILS IN APPROVED PRIVATE SCHOOL PLACEMENTS OR IN STATE OPERATED SCHOOLS [Section 4405(3) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $133.1 Million) This aid is available to those districts having contracts with approved private schools, Special Act School Districts, the New York State School for the Blind or the New York State School for the Deaf for the education of students with disabilities. Tuition charges for each school must be approved annually by the Education Department and the Division of the Budget. Aid is paid on the basis of base year attendance and tuition. Private Excess aidable cost is defined as the cost remaining after the deduction from the approved tuition charge of a basic contribution. The basic contribution for each individual pupil is based on the school district's property and non-property taxes divided by enrollment during the base year, and multiplied by the full-time equivalent enrollment of the pupil during the base year. Any STAR exemptions reimbursed by the State are included with the district's property and non-property taxes for this purpose. The formula for generating Private Excess Cost Aid is as follows: Per Pupil Aid = a) b) Approved Tuition Paid - Basic Contribution = Aidable Excess Cost Aidable Excess Cost X Private Excess Cost Aid Ratio X FTE of Pupil in the BaseYear = Excess Cost Aid  Total Aid = The sum of all per pupil aids The Private Excess Cost Aid Ratio is computed as follows: 1.000 - (CWR X .15) = Private Excess Cost Aid Ratio Minimum aid ratio = .500   29  Thus, the Private Excess Cost Aid ratio is 85 percent for a district of average wealth. Aid increases from 85 percent for poorer districts and decreases to a minimum of a 50 percent aid ratio for wealthier districts. Tuition for pupils in private school placements is paid directly by the school district to the private school. Tuition for pupils in placements at the State operated schools at Rome and Batavia will be deducted from State Aid payable to the school district in the Spring of 2000. Tuition for pupils in Special Act School Districts may involve two separate billings and payments as follows: Chapter 737 of the Laws of 1988 authorized Special Act School Districts to enter into leases, sub-leases or other agreements with the New York State Dormitory Authority for the financing of capital facilities construction. The statute established a special fund under the control of the State Comptroller known as the School Capital Facilities Financing Reserve Fund, and specified that a portion of the tuition payable by other public school districts to such Special Act School Districts should be paid directly to the New York State Education Department for deposit to this special fund. The Special Act School Districts will bill public school districts directly for these ""Part I Tuition Billings for Annual Dormitory Authority Rental Payments for Students Placed by Other Public School Districts."" Once the bill is received, the public school district should issue a check payable to the New York State Education Department in the amount of the Part I tuition and mail the payment directly to Dormitory Authority Reimbursement, New York State Education Department, Program Services Reimbursement Unit, Albany, New York 12234. The balance of the tuition payment for services provided to these students by the Special Act School District will be billed as a separate amount and will continue to be paid and mailed directly to the Special Act School District by the public school district. Please note: Private Excess Cost Aid is based on the total cost of the student's placement at the Special Act School District, including the Part I tuition costs paid to the State Education Department.  Special note regarding placements through the Children's Residential Project: Effective 7/1/95 children placed through the Children's Residential Project (CRP) process in an intermediate care facility are to have their tuition costs reimbursed by Medicaid directly to the educational provider. The district of residence should no longer pay the tuition cost, and therefore is not eligible to receive any Private Excess Cost Aid for such students. If the district has paid tuition for such a student after 7/1/95, the tuition paid should be refunded by the CRP school after the school receives reimbursement from Medicaid. A basic contribution amount will be assessed against the district of residence for such students. W. MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES (1999-00 Estimated Total = $432.0 Million: $216.0 Million = Districts' Share; $216.0 Million = State's Share) The Social Security Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorize Medicaid reimbursement for certain services provided to eligible students, ages three through 21, who receive special education services. Procedures have been implemented through Regional Information Centers for school districts to claim reimbursement for eligible expenditures and to receive such payments on a monthly basis. Actual reimbursements will be equal to 50   30 percent of approved expenditures. A portion of the Public Excess Cost Aid payable to the district in an amount equal to 50 percent of the approved expenditures is also paid to the district at the same time as the Medicaid payment. While the school district receives the 50 percent federal medicaid reimbursement in the first instance, one-half of all such payments received by the school district between May 1, 1999 and January 31, 2000 are claimed by the State as the State share of the medicaid reimbursement and will be deducted from the March 31, 2000 sustaining advance payments. Similarly, one-half of such Medicaid payments received between February 1, 2000 and April 30, 2000 will be deducted from the June 2000 payment of General State Aids. X. SPECIAL STATE AID FOR SMALL CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS [Section 3602(31-a) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $81.9 Million) A form of transition aid is provided to small city school districts which, until 1985, were subject to a constitutional tax limit. Under the formula defined by subdivision 31-a of Section 3602 of the Education Law a district must have received special aid pursuant to this subdivision during the prior year to be eligible for aid. The formula is as follows: {(Base Year Special Aid) / Base Year TGFE) X (Current Year Capped Budget - other State Aid Increases)} - (Full Value Millage Deduction) The budget, for aid purposes only, is limited to an increase over the prior year's total general fund expenses equal to the statewide 65th percentile percent increase of 8.29 percent. The save-harmless available to eligible districts in accordance with subdivision 31-a is 98 percent X prior year's special aid but reduced by two percent each year that save harmless aid is claimed and always applied to the prior year's special aid.  The aid pursuant to the formula set out under subdivision 31-a cannot exceed 98 percent X (Base Year Special Aid  Base Year TGFE) X Current Year's Budget. For aids payable in 1999-00, this formula is suspended. The 1999-00 Small Cities Aid is maintained at the 1994-95 aid amount, but the save-harmless percent to be used for 1999-00 will not be reduced for any district as a result. Y. REQUIRED SETASIDES [Section 3602(12) of the Education Law] Based on certain indicators of student and school success, school districts may be required to setaside a portion of the State Aid payable for 1999-00 to provide specific services to students. These setasides are determined as follows: 1. SETASIDE FOR ATTENDANCE IMPROVEMENT/DROPOUT PREVENTION AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH f OF SUBDIVISION 12 OF SECTION 3602 OF THE EDUCATION LAW (Total Required Statewide Setaside for 1999-00 = $54.9 Million)   31 Any school district with an attendance ratio in 1997-98 that is in the bottom decile of such attendance ratios for all districts ( <.9359) shall setaside a portion of any aid payable for the purpose of conducting programs to improve student attendance and student retention in accordance with a plan approved by the Commissioner. The setaside for attendance improvement and dropout prevention is calculated based on data on file with the Education Department as of July 1, 1999 and equals the product of (i) $325, (ii) the district's base year enrollment and (iii) the remainder resulting when such attendance ratio is subtracted from one; provided, however, that for the New York City Board of Education, $335 is substituted for $325. These provisions apply only if the product of clauses ii and iii exceed 461. The required setaside is reduced by the proportion of formula aids subject to transition that are withheld under the Transition Adjustment caps, if any. The 1999-00 set aside for the New York City Board of Education cannot be less than the amount set aside for this purpose in 1998-99. 2. SETASIDE FOR COMPENSATORY EDUCATION AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH g OF SUBDIVISION 12 OF SECTION 3602 OF THE EDUCATION LAW (Total Required Statewide Setaside for 1999-00 = $197.9 Million) Any school district with a percentage of pupils with compensatory educational needs based on the pupil evaluation tests administered in the Spring of 1997 that is in the top quartile of such percentages for all districts (>5.8%) shall setaside a portion of any aid payable for the purposes of compensatory education programs in accordance with a plan approved by the Commissioner. The setaside for compensatory education programs is calculated based on data on file with the Education Department as of July 1, 1999 and equals the product of (i) the greater of the product of $940 and the district's setaside ratio or $90 and (ii) the district's pupils with compensatory educational needs. The setaside ratio is calculated as follows: 1 - (.64 x CWR)  The number of pupils with compensatory educational needs equals the product of the percentage of pupils with compensatory educational needs based on the pupil evaluation tests administered in the Spring of 1997 multiplied by the district's public school enrollment for the 1998-99 school year. An additional setaside for compensatory education is required for the five large dependent city school districts of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and New York City. These dependent city districts and any other districts whose calculated PCEN setaside is greater than 5.6% of the district's Comprehensive Operating Aid and also greater than $250,000 must submit a setaside program budget and program plan to the Education Department for approval. The required setaside is reduced by the proportion of formula aids subject to transition that are withheld under the Transition Adjustment caps, if any. 3. SETASIDE FOR EARLY GRADE INTERVENTION AS REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH h OF SUBDIVISION 12 OF SECTION 3602 OF THE EDUCATION LAW (Total Required Statewide Setaside for 1999-00 = $17.5 Million) The city school districts of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and New York City must set aside a portion of aids payable for the purpose of reducing class size and increasing individualized attention in grades one, two and three. The setaside for early grade intervention is calculated based on data on file with the Education Department as of July 1, 1999 and equal s the product of (i) $120, (ii) the district's setaside ratio and (iii) 30% of the district's 1998-9+9 enrollment. The setaside ratio is calculated as follows:   32 1 - (.64 X CWR)  The required setaside is reduced by the proportion of formula aids subject to transition that are withheld under the Transition Adjustment caps, if any.   33 II OTHER AIDS DISPLAYED ON AID PROJECTION PRINTOUTS (OTHER ""COMPUTERIZED"" AIDS) Z. AID FOR SHARED SERVICES 1. BOCES AID [Section 1950(5) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $426.0 Million) School districts which are components of a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) are eligible for BOCES Aid. BOCES receive State Aid on behalf of their components for approved service costs, administrative expenditures, facility rental and construction costs. BOCES may provide services on a cooperative basis upon the request of two or more component school districts with the approval of the Commissioner of Education. BOCES Aid is calculated based on the central administrative expenses of the BOCES, expenses of aidable shared services and expenditures for construction or rental of BOCES facilities. For this purpose BOCES activities are divided into the following general program or service areas: PROGRAM OR SERVICE CODE 001 002 100 200 300 400 500A 500B 500C 600 700  PROGRAM OR SERVICE BOCES Administration BOCES Facilities Career Education Special Education for Pupils with Disabilities Itinerant Teacher Services General Instruction Instructional Support: Technology Services Instructional Support: Staff Development Other Instructional Support Other Services Operation and Maintenance of BOCES Facilities and Other Internal Services  NOTE: These services are aided under the Public Excess Cost Aid formulas and do not generate BOCES Aid.  NOTE: These services support other BOCES service programs and are aided only to the extent that the supported service program is aided.  a. BOCES SERVICES AID (1999-00 Estimated Total = $355.3 Million) BOCES Services Aid provides reimbursement for base year service costs in the areas of career education, itinerant teacher services, general instruction, instructional support, and other miscellaneous services as approved by the Commissioner. The following limitations apply to the computation of services aid:   34     Service costs are aidable only to the extent that they are approved for aid. An employee's annualized salary is aidable up to $30,000. Expenditures for the education of students with disabilities are not eligible for BOCES Aid. Public School Excess Cost Aid is provided directly to the district of residence for a student with disabilities in the case of a BOCES placement. Expenditures for transporting pupils to and from BOCES classes are not eligible for BOCES Aid. Transportation Aid is provided to the district responsible for providing such services.    The costs of approved services are distributed among districts based on participation. BOCES Services Aid is calculated separately for each district by applying to approved service expenses for the base year an aid ratio which is the higher of: a. A millage ratio based on the district tax rate equal to: 1 - [.008/(District's 1998-99 Prop & NonProp Tax Levy / 1996 Full Value)] NOTE: For central high school districts and their component elementary districts, .003 is used instead of .008. OR b. An aid ratio, with a minimum of .360 and a maximum of .900, calculated as follows: 1 - .51 X [(District's 1996 Full Value / 1997-98 RWADA) / $291,500 ] b. BOCES ADMINISTRATIVE AID (1999-00 Estimated Total = $45.8 Million) BOCES Administrative Aid provides reimbursement for base year administrative costs less the greater of:   any administrative costs in excess of 10 percent of the board's total expenditures; or the sum of all employees' annualized salaries that are in excess of $30,000.  The costs of administrative services are allocated among component school districts either on the basis of full value, on the basis of weighted average daily attendance, or on the basis of the public school enrollment of each component. BOCES Administrative Aid is calculated separately for each component school district by multiplying approved administrative expenses allocated to the district by the selected aid ratio for BOCES Services Aid.   35 c. BOCES FACILITIES AID (1999-00 Estimated Total = $24.7 Million) BOCES Facilities Aid may be claimed for approved expenditures for facility construction, purchase or lease. Aid is calculated by multiplying the approved expense by the aid ratio described in 1b above, except the minimum aid ratio is zero. There is no allowance for an optional millage ratio for BOCES Facilities Aid. Approved expenses are those incurred by the component school district during the current school year for approved debt service payments on debt instruments used to finance BOCES construction, for expenditures from budgetary appropriations or capital reserves in support of BOCES construction and for expenditures for lease of BOCES facilities. d. BOCES DUE-SAVE-HARMLESS AID (1999-00 estimated Total = $0.2 Million) The amount of total BOCES Aid apportioned to a component school district of the BOCES cannot be less than was apportioned to the component school district during the 1967-68 school year, unless the component's expenditures for BOCES services are now less than during 1966-67. e. PAYMENT OF BOCES AID BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school district of the BOCES, but the sum of all such aids are paid directly to the BOCES and not to the component school districts. Once the State Aid is received by the BOCES, the BOCES refunds an amount equal to aid received on behalf of each component school district to the components. 2. SHARED SERVICES AID FOR NONCOMPONENTS OF BOCES [Section 1950(8-c) and 3602(20) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $10.0 Million) There are currently seven school districts that are noncomponrnts of BOCES by choice and the five dependent city school districts of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers and New York City that are noncomponents by law. These 11 noncomponent districts may, however, claim Shared Services Aid for staff development services purchased in the base year through a BOCES, and, in the case of the five dependent city school districts, for staff development services provided directly by the city school district or in collaboration with one or more institutions of higher education. Services purchased through a BOCES must be provided through the BOCES serving the geographic area of the noncomponent district, except that the New York City Board of Education may purchase such services through any BOCES with a geographic area adjoining the City School District. BOCES may assess an administrative charge to the noncomponent school district purchasing such staff development services equal to the cost of services multiplied by the indirect cost rate established for the BOCES and used to claim indirect costs on categorical grant programs. The formula for calculating Shared Services Aid for Noncomponents is: Approved Expenditures X Shared Services Aid Ratio Approved expenditures = the sum of the cost of base year instructional support services and indirect costs purchased through BOCES plus, for the five dependent city school districts, the cost of base year   36 instructional support services provided directly by the school district or in collaboration with an institution of higher learning. Shared Services Aid ratio = the greater of:  An aid ratio, with a minimum of .360 and a maximum of .900, calculated as follows: 1  - .51 X [(District's 1996 Full Value / 1997-98 RWADA) / $291,500 ]  A Millage Ratio = to 1 - [.008/(District's 1998-99 Prop & NonProp Tax Levy / 1996 Full Value)] Note: For central high school districts and their component elementary districts, .003 is used instead of .008.  For the purposes of calculating a millage ratio, the five dependent city school districts use the tax rate computed pursuant to Section 3602(31-a)(a)(7) of the Education Law.  AA. TEXTBOOK AID [Section 701 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $151.5 Million) Each public school district may claim an apportionment of Textbook Aid in an amount equal to the district's actual expenditures during the base year for textbook purchases for public and nonpublic pupils up to a maximum equal to the product of $46.90 multiplied by the number of pupils residing in the district and enrolled during the 199899 (base year) in grades K-12 in a public or nonpublic school. Eligible textbooks for aids payable in 2000-01 and thereafter may include courseware or other content based instructional material in an electronic format. Each public school district is required to purchase and loan textbooks during the current year on an equitable basis to both public and resident nonpublic students. These revenues are received by the school district according to the following schedule: September 1: An amount equal to $15 multiplied by the number of resident public and nonpublic pupils is paid as part of the school district's Lottery payment. Subsequent Payments: Additional payment of Textbook Aid up to the maximum of $46.90 per pupil (including the $15 Lottery Aid) will be made in the Spring of 2000. For aids payable in 1999-00 and beyond the aid per pupil is enriched as follows: SCHOOL YEAR 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Thereafter AID PER PUPIL $ 46.87 $ 57.30 $78.18  The amount of aid calculated pursuant to this formula is considered final and not subject to change after April 30 of the school year for which such aid is payable.   37  BB. LIBRARY MATERIALS AID [Section 711 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $15.3 Million) Each public school district may claim an apportionment of Library Materials Aid in an amount equal to the product of $6 multiplied by the number of pupils attending schools within the school district's boundaries and enrolled during the 1998-99 (base) school year in grades K-12 in a public or nonpublic school. Each public school district is required to use such funds to purchase and loan library materials on an equitable basis for use by public and nonpublic students attending schools within the district's boundaries during the 1999-00 (current) school year. Aid is equal to the lessor of the maximum apportionment of $6 per pupil or the actual expenditures incurred by the school district for purchase of library materials during 1998-99. The amount of aid calculated pursuant to this formula is considered final and not subject to change after April 30 of the school year for which such aid is payable. CC. AID FOR CONVERSION TO FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS [Section 3602(12-a) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $8.3 Million) For aids payable in the 1999-00 school year, school districts that initiate a full day kindergarten program will be entitled to an additional apportionment. The amount of the apportionment shall equal the product of the selected aid per pupil unit used to calculate Operating Aid in the current year multiplied by the difference between the enrollment in the district of full day kindergarten students in the current year minus such enrollment in the base year. To be eligible to receive this new apportionment, however, the district must have offered no kindergarten programs or a half-day kindergarten program in both the base year and during the 1996-97 school year, and must now offer a full day program to all pupils who wish to attend. This conversion aid will be paid to eligible districts in June 2000, but the payment will be limited to the lesser of the estimated aid as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9899,"" which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 1999-00 State Aid to Localities Budget, or the actual aid claimed based on Full Day Kindergarten enrollment reported in the Fall of 1999 on the BEDS report of the district. Any resulting unpaid claimed aid will be paid on or after September 1, 2000. DD. UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN GRANTS [Section 3602-e of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $100.0 Million) For aids payable in 1999-00 and 2000-01, any school district that has not previously been eligible for this aid and identified by the Commissioner as having 20 or more aidable prekindergarten pupils by November 15 of the base year must form a prekindergarten policy advisory board to consider and make recommendations to the board of education of the school district regarding the initiation of prekindergarten programs. For aids payable in 2001-02, all school districts must form such a policy advisory board. Such recommendations must be based on consideration of at least the following factors: 1) the projected number of children eligible to participate in a prekindergarten program over the next five years;   38 2) the short and long term benefits of such a program to eligible children; 3) the needs of the parents of eligible children, including the number of eligible children who require a full day program because their parents, or those in parental relationship with the child work; 4) the ease of utilization and accessibility of the program to parents of eligible children; 5) the availability and capacity of existing facilities of potential program providers; and 6) the most appropriate and effective manner in which to provide programs to most efficiently utilize the resources of the school district, the community and other agencies eligible to provide the service within the school district. The advisory board is to be appointed by the superintendent of schools for each school district, and for each community school district in New York City. The membership of the advisory board must include, but is not limited to members of the board of education, teachers employed by the school district selected by the collective bargaining unit, parents of children who attend the schools of the district, community leaders and child care and early education providers. Each advisory board must hold at least one public hearing during the 1999-00 base year prior to determining what recommendations it will make to the board of education regarding implementation of a universal prekindergarten program. Within 30 days of receipt of the recommendations of the advisory board, the board of education may adopt, modify or reject such recommendations. Any decision to modify or reject the recommendations, however, must first be discussed with the advisory board in a public meeting. The school district may choose to coordinate proposals for the provision of prekindergarten services with other eligible agencies in the school district. For this purpose the school district is authorized to enter into contractual or other arrangements necessary to implement prekindergarten services pursuant to the plan adopted. At least 10 percent of the total grant to the school district must be setaside for such collaborative efforts. The Commissioner of Education shall award grant funds to school districts electing to provide prekindergarten programs based on approved plans and applications. The amount of each school district's grant for 1999-00 will be determined as follows: Aid per Aidable Prekindergarten Pupil* = the Greater of $2,700 or the Sum of: [$600 + ($4,000 X Sharing Ratio**)], but not more than $4,000 per Aidable Pupil.  For grants awarded in 2000-2001 the formula used in determining grant amounts will be: Aid per Aidable Prekindergarten Pupil* = the Greater of $2,000 or the Sum of: [$260 + ($4,000 X Sharing Ratio**)], but not more than $4,000 per Aidable Pupil.  *  The number of aidable prekindergarten pupils is equal to the product of the following factors:  The number of unserved pupils in the school district. A pupil is considered unserved if attaining the age of four before December 1 of the school year and not served during such year in a state funded prekindergarten program. A poverty factor equal to either 1 or the percent of eligible applicants for the free and reduced     39 price lunch program (FRPL %) in the district as follows:  SCHOOL YEAR 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Thereafter  Phase-in Factor equal to: SCHOOL YEAR 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Thereafter **  NEW YORK CITY 1.000 1.000 1.000  OTHER DISTRICTS FRPL % FRPL % 1.000  NEW YORK CITY .299 .660 1.000  OTHER DISTRICTS .525 1.000 1.000  The sharing ratio for aids payable in 1999-00 equals the Operating Aid Sharing Ratio multiplied by: 1 + [(the district's extraordinary needs % - .934) / .047]; but not less than 1.000.  **  The sharing ratio for aids payable in 2000-01 and thereafter equals the Operating Aid Sharing Ratio multiplied by: 1 + [(the district's extraordinary needs % - .94)/.047]; but not less than 1.000. Total Grant = Aidable Prekindergarten Pupils X Aid per Aidable Prekindergarten Pupils Note: For grants awarded in 1999-00 and 2000-01, the number of aidable prekindergarten pupils must be greater than or equal to 20 in order for the school district to receive a grant. The total grant payable will be based on the lesser of the pupils actually served as of November first of the current school year or the aidable prekindergarten pupils and the lesser of the grant computed based on data on file with the th Commissioner as of April 30 of the year for which such grant is payable or the actual grant expenditures incurred by the district as approved by the Commissioner. Statewide appropriations in support of prekindergarten programs is projected to be $100 million in 1999-00, $225 million in 2000-01, and $500 million in 2001-02 and thereafter.  EE. GRANTS FOR EARLY GRADE CLASS SIZE REDUCTION [Section 3602(37) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $75.0 Million) Beginning with the 1999-00 school year school districts may be for the purpose of reducing class size in kindergarten and in grades 1 based on criteria of: average class size, concentrations of students with measured by the combined wealth ratio of the district. These criteria grants are available: eligible to receive additional grants in aid through 3. Eligible districts are defined extraordinary needs and district wealth as are defined as follows for each year that   40  1) Eligible districts for grants payable in the 1999-00 school year must satisfy the following criteria: a) Must have had an average class size in kindergarten through grade 3 that was greater than 20 in the 1993-94 school year based on data included in the Annual Fiscal Profile Report of the district released by the Commissioner of Education in May 1996. Must have an extraordinary needs percent for aids payable in the current year equal to or greater than 40%. Must have a combined wealth ratio for aids payable in the current year that is not greater than 1.500 (not more than 1- times as wealthy as the State average).  b)  c)  2) Eligible districts for grants payable in the 2000-01 school year must satisfy the following criteria: a) Must have had an average class size in kindergarten through grade 3 that was greater than 20 in the 1993-94 school year based on data included in the Annual Fiscal Profile Report of the district released by the Commissioner of Education in May 1996. Must have an extraordinary needs percent for aids payable in the current year equal to or greater than 24.8%. Must have a combined wealth ratio for aids payable in the current year that is not greater than 2.000 (not more than twice as wealthy as the State average).  b)  c)  3) Eligible districts for grants payable in the 2001-02 school year and thereafter must satisfy the following criteria: a) Must have had an average class size in kindergarten through grade 3 that was greater than 20 in the 1993-94 school year based on data included in the Annual Fiscal Profile Report of the district released by the Commissioner of Education in May 1996. Must have an extraordinary needs percent for aids payable in the current year equal to or greater than 9.4%. Must have a combined wealth ratio for aids payable in the current year that is not greater than 2.500 (not more than 2-1/2 times as wealthy as the State average).  b)  c)  In order to receive a grant, an eligible school district must prepare and submit a plan for reducing class size in kindergarten through grade 3 to the Commissioner of Education for approval. Districts with an approved plan will then be awarded grants based on the following calculations: New Classroom Grant This grant equals the product of: An Additional Classroom Factor X [A Basic Grant per Classroom + A Start Up Grant of $10,000]   41  Additional Classroom Factor = the lesser of: (1) the number of new, additional classrooms to be operated in the current school year under the plan approved by the Commissioner; (2) the number of new, additional classrooms needed to reach the goal of 20 pupils per classroom multiplied by a factor determined as follows:  School Year 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 and Thereafter or  New York City 18.7% 34.6% 55.8%  Other Big Five 33.3% 66.7% 100%  Rest of State 40% 40% 40%  (3) the number of new, additional classrooms that the school district guarantees will be open on the first day of school. Basic Grant per Classroom = the product of the following factors: (1) the median salary of teachers with 5 years of experience in the district for the 1994-95 school year as reported to the Commissioner by February 1, 1997, or $34,089 if such data is not available; (2) 1.0609; and (3) The sum of one plus the percentage of salaries represented by fringe benefits paid by the school district for the 1994-95 school year. Continuing Classroom Grant This grant equals any New Classroom Grant received during the prior school year minus any portion of such grant that was attributable to the $10,000 per classroom start up grant. Total Funding Statewide appropriations in support of Early Grade Class Size Reduction Grants are projected to be $75 million in 1999-00, $140 million in 2000-01 and $225 million in 2001-02 and thereafter. FF. TAX LIMITATION AID [ Section 3602(21) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $25.0 Million) Beginning with the 1999-00 school year, school districts that levy local property taxes and satisfy certain criteria will be eligible for Tax Limitation Aid in addition to other general formula aids. A district is eligible for Tax Limitation Aid if its 1996 residential real property levy is greater than 3.9% of its 1996 adjusted gross income and its full value wealth ratio is less than 2.0.   42 Tax Limitation Aid for eligible districts is calculated as follows: Per Pupil Formula Ceiling X Tax Limitation Aid Ratio X Selected TAPU for Payment Formula Ceiling = .0305 X 1996 Residential Tax Levy Per Pupil (Sel. TAPU) Tax Limitation Aid Ratio = 1 - (Combined Wealth Ratio X .5) For 1999-00, the total allocation for Tax Limitation Aid is limited to $25 million. If the total of all claims exceeds this amount, aid will be prorated among those districts claiming the aid. All such prorations will be deemed final and seventy percent of the aid will be paid to eligible districts on March 15. The remaining balance will be paid after April 1. GG. TARGETED INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT GRANTS [Section 3641(9) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $5 Million) Beginning with the 1998-99 school year the Commissioner of Education is authorized to award staff development grants to school districts for staff development activities offered independently by the school district and/or in collaboration with institutions of higher education, teacher resource and computer resource centers, and providers of pre-kindergarten services. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis within the available State appropriation for such grants based on criteria established by the Commissioner. Approved expenditures for staff development may include, but need not be limited to: reasonable travel costs for instructors, reasonable costs for the use of technology to provide staff development at a distance, and the cost of employing substitute teachers for teachers participating in the staff development activities during scheduled class time. The following sums represent proposed appropriations for such grants: 1999-00 - $5,000,000; 2000-01 and thereafter $10,000,000. HH. STATE AID PAYABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IMPACTED BY SCHOOL TAX SAVINGS UNDER THE SCHOOL TAX RELIEF (STAR) PROGRAM [Section 1306-a of the Real Property Tax Law] (1999-00 Estimated Total = $1.387 Billion*) Chapter 389 of the Laws of 1997 created a program to reduce school property taxes beginning with taxes levied for the 1998-99 school year. These tax reductions will initially be applied to taxes levied on the residential property of senior citizens, and will then be increased and expanded to include the residential property of other school district taxpayers. The school tax bill of any taxpayer entitled to an exemption under the STAR program must include a statement as follows: ""Your tax savings this year resulting from the New York State School Tax Relief (STAR) program is $ xxx.xx."" The total school tax savings duly provided by each school district to the taxpayers of the school district pursuant to the STAR program will be a charge upon the State and the school district will be reimbursed for the resulting loss in revenues through additional State Aid payable as follows:   43 To claim State Aid related to loss in local tax revenues under the STAR Program in the 1999-00 school year and thereafter, a school district must submit an application to the Office of Real Property Services (ORPS) containing information regarding the loss in revenues and the exemptions that resulted in such loss in a format to be established by ORPS. Upon approval of the application, ORPS will calculate and certify to the Commissioner of Education the amount of aid payable to the school district for exemptions granted under the STAR Program for taxes levied in the current school year. A separate payment schedule is created for the payment of School Tax Relief Aid representing tax savings provided by school districts to their taxpayers under the STAR Program. For the 1999-00 school year, school districts will be guaranteed payment of 35% of STAR Aid by October 15, 70% by November 15, 80% by December 15, and the balance by the first business day in January. For the 2000-01 school year and thereafter STAR Aid will be paid pursuant to a schedule based on the recommendations of the School District Cash Flow Study Commission's report which was submitted to the Governor and the Legislature in March, 1998. * This total includes State reimbursement for $217 million in income tax credits applicable only to New York City, under Section 1310-e of the Tax Law.   44 III OTHER MISCELLANEOUS AIDS II. SUMMER COMPONENT OF TWELVE MONTH PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES [Section 4408 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $163.7 Million) This program is for school aged children with disabilities of such a severity as to warrant a 12-month program. 80% State Aid is provided to school districts for the cost of education, maintenance and transportation provided during July and August. The remaining 20% of costs is paid by the local school districts from the General Fund. The State Education Department later collects 10% of verified costs from the county of residence. Pupils are identified by the Committee on Special Education and the district files with the Education Department via the STAC System for program approval and payment. The approved costs of education and maintenance are established by the Education Department. The district reports the actual cost of transportation. Revenues and payments for this program are all accounted for in the Special Aid Fund. After the to verify STAC providers. Up to the remainder of program is completed, the districts must verify and submit an Automated Verification Listing (AVL) enrollment and maintenance dates and transportation costs and dates. Districts pay the service 56 % of verified aidable costs may be reimbursed by the Education Department prior to April 1, with the 80% total aid payable before June 30th. JJ. EDUCATION AID FOR PUPILS FROM THE OFFICE OF MENTAL RETARDATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES [Section 3202(5) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $20.0 Million) Since 1976 special sections have been added to Education Law which provide for aid payments of the full tuition for certain pupils. Pupils who generate the aid are those who: a) reside in a group or family care home operated by the OMRDD who previously resided within a school for the mentally retarded operated by the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities; reside in a school for the mentally retarded operated by the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities who are placed in a public school or BOCES program; reside in an intermediate care facility or an individualized residential alternative.  b)  c)  The district in which the institution is located is responsible for placing such children and submitting claims for full tuition to the Education Department. Each child for whom full tuition aid is paid must be approved and verified by the school district via the STAC/AVL process. Tuition aid is paid to each district during the current year of education of such pupils. The original school district of residence of children covered by these provisions must reimburse the State a defined amount of basic contribution in the following year. This basic contribution is collected as described in Section E of this summary. (Note: Effective July 1, 1995 pupils who reside in an intermediate care facility and also   45 attend the private school operated by the intermediate care facility are aided through the Medicaid system. The tuition reimbursement is paid from Medicaid directly to the intermediate care facility.) KK. INCARCERATED YOUTH AID [Section 3202(7) and Section 3602(35) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $10.5 Million) School districts are required to provide, upon request, a suitable educational program to youth incarcerated in county correctional facilities located within the district for the months of September through June. Programs also may be continued during July and August. Educational services may be provided by the school district itself or through a contract with a Board of Cooperative Educational Services or another public school district. Participation is at the option of the individual incarcerated youth. The State Education Department approves participation of incarcerated youth on an individual basis via the STAC system. Aid is paid on a current year basis to the school district and is equal to the lesser of the following, except that in no case will a district with verified enrollment receive less than $15,000 per year: 1. The district's approved operating expense per pupil in the year prior to the base year multiplied by 1.25 multiplied by aggregate, verified full-time equivalent enrollment of all incarcerated youths, in 10 month programs, or such approved operating expense per pupil multiplied by 1.50 multiplied by aggregate verified full-time equivalent enrollment of all incarcerated youth in 12 month programs. Actual total instructional cost of providing the incarcerated youth program plus approved administrative costs. Approved administrative costs may not exceed five percent of total instructional costs.  2.  The school district of residence of the youth on the date of incarceration reimburses the State a defined amount of local contribution during the following school year. LL. AID FOR EDUCATION OF HOMELESS OR RUNAWAY PUPILS [Section 3209 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $3.8 Million) There is State reimbursement of 100 percent of the direct cost of educational services provided to a nonresident homeless or runaway pupil by the school district of current location, or a school district participating in a regional placement plan, when such a district is designated as the district which the pupil shall attend. Aid will be paid to the educating district through the STAC system. Homeless pupils may be referred by the County Department of Social Services, or by other independent agencies (e.g, a church) or may self refer themselves to the district of current location. The district provides approval from the State if the current year of education of reimburses the State a defined the attendance and program information through STAC and must obtain tuition rate pupil is educated in a district operated program. Aid is paid to each district during the such pupils. The school district of last attendance before the pupil became homeless amount of local contribution during the following school year.  MM. EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION EDUCATION AID   46 [Section 3602(24) of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $96.18 Million) This aid is available to those districts or BOCES serving persons 21 years of age or older who have not received a high school diploma or a high school equivalency diploma, who attend Employment Preparation Education programs provided by the district or BOCES which lead to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma. Such programs must provide services in accordance with a comprehensive plan of service as approved by the Commissioner of Education. The formula for generating aid is: Current Year Instruction Hours X $6.25 X Aid Ratio (minimum aid ratio = .400) Aid is paid directly to the school district or BOCES operating the program. Formula components can be expressed as follows: a) 1.000 - (PWR X .40) = Aid Ratio (minimum .400)* PWR (Pupil Wealth Ratio) = District FV/TWPU* $243,800  b)  Employment Preparation Aid Contact Hours = Total hours of instruction in employment preparation provided to all eligible students between July 1 and June 30. Employment Preparation Aid Ceiling = The statewide average expense per pupil divided by 1,000.  c)  For aid payable in 1999-00 this is: ($6,250) 1000 = $6.25  *BOCES use the greater of a BOCES-wide aid ratio (minimum of .400) or 85 percent of the highest aid ratio of any BOCES component school district. Attendance counts of students in such approved programs may not be included in any other attendance counts. EPE Aid is paid directly to the district or BOCES providing the educational program, which then may bill a net tuition charge to the district of residence if any local funds are required to support the program. Pupils under the age of 21 in similar programs are included in average daily attendance as students in equivalent attendance, unless BOCES Aid is generated and claimed. For aid payable in 1999-00 up to 25 percent of the total appropriation of $96.18 million will be paid after April 1, 2000, based on claims submitted by March 1. If the claims received exceed the available 25 percent of the appropriation, aid will be prorated. A final payment of claims up to the maximum apportionment of $96.18 million will be paid after October 1, 2000 based on aid claims submitted by September 15, 2000. If claims exceed the   47 appropriation, aid will again be prorated. NN. AID FOR NON-OPERATING DISTRICTS (100 percent Contracting Districts) [Section 2043 of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $0) General aid for a district not maintaining a school and contracting for the education of its children, is based on approved operating expenses and transportation expenses. In this case, tuition is considered an approved operating expense. The aid is calculated by deducting from operating and transportation expenses a local contribution expressed as a tax rate per $1,000 of actual (full) value of the district's real property. The tax rate is the higher of (a) the tax rate of the receiving district(s) with the highest rate or (b) $10.00 per $1,000 of actual valuation. OO. AID FOR DISTRICTS WITH FEWER THAN EIGHT TEACHERS [Section 3602-b of the Education Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $0) General aid for districts employing fewer than eight teachers is based on operating expenses and transportation expenses only. Operating expenses are computed just as they are for eight-or-more-teacher districts. Approved operating expenses are limited to the sum of (a) $4,500 multiplied by the number of full-time teachers employed during the base year and, (b) the base year WADA multiplied by $60 plus an amount computed by multiplying the base year WADA by $0.90. Operating aid is computed by multiplying the approved operating expenses by the RWADA aid ratio. Transportation expenses and aid are calculated as for eight-or-more teacher districts. When local revenue raised by tax for school purposes is less than $9.00 per $1,000 of actual (full) valuation, the apportionment is reduced by the difference between the local revenue and the amount that would have been raised by the $9.00 tax rate. In effect, this is a State aid penalty for localities with insufficient contributions to education. PP. LOTTERY REVENUES USED TO FUND APPORTIONMENTS PAYABLE TO PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS [Section 92-c of the State Finance Law] (1999-00 Estimated Aid = $1,345 Million) Annual proceeds from the New York State Lottery are used to support elementary, middle and secondary education. This is accomplished by using a share of the Lottery proceeds computed according to an equalized formula based on each school district's taxable property wealth per pupil to support the General State Aids otherwise payable to the school district. In addition, a portion of the Lottery proceeds equal to $15.00 per resident pupil is paid to each school district for the purchase of textbooks. The total Lottery apportionment available to support elementary, middle and secondary education programs for the 1999-00 school year is $1,345 million. These funds are already included in the estimate of 1999-00 aids reported in other sections of this manual.   48 IV PAYMENT SCHEDULES QQ. 1999-00 GENERAL AIDS PAYABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR AIDS IDENTIFIED WITH A SINGLE ASTERISK IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS [Section 3609-a of the Education Law]   A payment in the amount of lottery revenues available to fund apportionments payable to public school districts is paid in full on or before September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) are paid by the State on behalf of the school districts from General Aid apportionments on or before the 15th of each of the months of September, October and November. If the General Aid apportionments remaining after apportionment of the Lottery revenues are insufficient to fund the TRS obligations, the school district is billed directly by TRS for the balance. For the purpose of calculating these payments General Aid apportionments payable to the district may not exceed the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900"" which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 1999-00 State Aid to Localities Budget. Additional fixed fall payments are paid directly to the school district on the 15th of the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's General Aid apportionments, after deduction of payments made to TRS on the district's behalf, is paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent on or before October 15, 18.75 percent on or before November 15 and 25.00 percent on or before December 15. For the purpose of calculating these payments General Aid apportionments payable to the district may not exceed the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900"" which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 1999-00 State Aid to Localities Budget. Additional individualized payments are calculated for the months of January through June, based on school district State Aid claims or projection data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. These payments are calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of State and local revenues in support of the general fund budget by the first business day of January, 60 percent by the first business day of February, 70 percent by the first business day of March, 80 percent by the first business day of April and 90 percent by the first business day of May. While calculated in this manner, all of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31. For the purpose of calculating these payments General Aid apportionments payable to the district may not exceed the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900"" which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 1999-00 State Aid to Localities Budget. Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year are paid to school districts on March 31 on a prorata basis using the district's relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total moneys designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the         49 State Fiscal Year, the total designated for March (if a the State Fiscal Year, the Support of Public Schools  moneys designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General are used.  Any Building Aid payable for new debt service or debt service on bond anticipation notes (BANS), any Growth Aid, and any Aid for Conversion to Full Day Kindergarten Programs will be paid as part of the remaining balance of General Aids payable on the first business day in June except that the total of all General Aid payments to a school district through June may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900"" which was released in August 1999 following enactment of the 199900 State Aid to Localities Budget. Any excess of actual General Aid appportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9900,"" shall be paid on the first business day of September, 2000. RR. EXCESS COST AIDS PAYABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR AIDS IDENTIFIED WITH A DOUBLE ASTERISK IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS [Section 3609-b of the Education Law]    Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Reimbursement). Such State share monies are to be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid Reimbursement. In addition, Section 3609-b requires that any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids payable to a school district shall be paid in accordance with the following schedule:  Payment Date December 15  Payment Amounts The positive remainder of 25 percent of such aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November. For the purpose of calculating this payment the total Excess Cost Aids payable to the district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing released following enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget. The positive remainder of 70 percent of such aids minus any apportionment previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August-February. For the purpose of calculating this payment the total Excess Cost Aids payable to the district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing released following enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget. The positive remainder of 85 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August-May. For the purpose of calculating this payment the total Excess Cost Aids payable to the district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing released following enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget.  March 15  June 15   50 August 15 The positive remainder of 100 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August-July.

TT. BOCES AID PAYABLE TO BOCES AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION Z-1 OF THIS MANUAL [Section 3609-d of the Education Law]   BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school district of the BOCES, but the sum of all such payments are paid directly to the BOCES. BOCES obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) are paid by the State on behalf of the BOCES from the apportionment payable to the BOCES on or before the fifteenth of each of the months of September, October and November. If the apportionment payable to the BOCES is insufficient to fund the TRS obligation, the BOCES is billed directly by TRS for the balance. For the purpose of calculating these payments the total BOCES Aid payable may not exceed 100 percent of the amount of such aid payable to the BOCES as reported in the school aid computer listing released following enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget. On or before February 1 an additional payment is made to BOCES equal to 25 percent of the total BOCES Aid payable for the school year less the previous payments made to TRS on the BOCES' behalf. For the purpose of calculating these payments the total BOCES Aid payable may not exceed 100 percent of the sum of the amount of such aid payable to the BOCES as reported in the school aid computer listing released following enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget plus any BOCES Aid payable on behalf of Special Act School Districts, school districts employing less than eight teachers or school districts that contract with another school district for all instructional services. For purposes of this description such sum shall be referred to as ""projected aids."" An additional payment is made to the BOCES on the first business day of June equal to 55 percent of the lesser of actual BOCES Aid payable or the projected aids minus the sum of all previous payments including payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf. Any remaining apportionment payable to the BOCES, including any excess of actual BOCES Aid payable over the amount of such aid reported in the school aid computer listing shall be paid to the BOCES on the first business day of September of the following school year. st        UU. 1999-00 PAYMENT SCHEDULE FOR SCHOOL TAX RELIEF (STAR) AID AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION HH OF THIS MANUAL  On or before October 15, 35% of STAR Aid will be paid.   52      On or before November 15, 70% of STAR Aid, minus any payment made in October, will be paid. On or before December 15, 80% of STAR Aid, minus any payments made in October or November, will be paid. January payment. On or before the first business day of January, the balance of STAR Aid still owed to the district will be paid. For aids payable in 2000-01 and thereafter, STAR Aid will be paid pursuant to a schedule that is based on the portion that STAR Aid represents of the school district's total property tax levy for school purposes as recommended by the STAR Cash Flow Study Commission's report to the Governor and the Legislature submitted in March 1998. VV. OTHER AIDS Questions regarding the schedules for payment of other aids may be directed to the State Aid Unit, 518: 474-  2977. WW. PAYMENT SCHEDULE AND POLICY REGARDING AID ADJUSTMENTS OCCURRING AFTER THE LAST SCHEDULED AID PAYMENTS FOR A GIVEN YEAR  Any supplemental documentation of original claims still pending review by the State Education Department for the 1997-98 aid year and thereafter, (including tax certiorari adjustments), that increases aids payable and is received by the State Education Department after June 30 of the school year for which aid is claimed, will not be included in the final adjustment of aids due to the district or BOCES upon completion of the desk review of the original claim. Such claims will be paid as a prior year adjustment pursuant to Section 3604(5) of the Education Law in the order that such adjustment is verified for payment and to the extent that funds have been appropriated for such prior year adjustments. Any special legislation granting a waiver of requirements for the payment of State Aid, such as a waiver of the requirement for timely submission of transportation contracts to the Commissioner of Education, will be considered as supplemental documentation of the original claim and will be subject to this policy unless the special legislation specifically authorizes payment during the current school year.     53 APPENDIX A EXPLANATION OF PUPIL COUNTS; WEALTH MEASURES; AND LOCAL EXPENDITURES, MEASUREMENTS, AND ADJUSTMENTS A. PUPIL COUNTS ADA Average Daily Attendance. This is the average number of pupils present on each regular school day, an average determined by dividing the aggregate number of attendance days of all pupils by the number of days school was in session. ADA for a group of classes or schools in session for varying numbers of days is obtained by adding together the ADA for each. Adjustments are made for the adverse effects of religious holidays on enrollment. ADA includes the equivalent attendance of pupils under the age of 21 not on a regular dayschool register in a program leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma and the base year FTE enrollment of pupils with disabilities enrolled full time in BOCES. Section 3602-c of the Education Law provides a methodology for calculating the average daily attendance of nonpublic school students who attend public schools for a portion of the school day in programs for gifted and talented students, occupational education or special education. The daily attendance of such pupils is calculated as one or more fifths of a full unit of daily attendance based on the number of periods attended each day in the public school programs. The calculated dual enrollment ADA is added to regular school ADA for the purposes of calculating State Aids payable to the public school district. This is average daily attendance with half-day kindergarten weighted at 0.50. Weighted Average Daily Attendance. This is a pupil count determined by applying the following weightings to average daily attendance: half-day kindergarten, 0.50; full day kindergarten and grades one through six, 1.00; grades seven through twelve, 1.25. Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance. This pupil measurement is a count, weighted for certain groups of students, for all resident pupils in the district. It is calculated by subtracting the WADA of nonresident pupils attending public school in the district from the district's WADA and adding the WADA of resident pupils of the district who are in full time attendance at a school operated by a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a County Vocational Education and Extension Board, or another public school district.  Dual Enrollment ADA  Adjusted ADA WADA  RWADA  TWPU  Total Wealth Pupil Units. This is the pupil count used along with other   54 wealth variables to measure the relative wealth of a district. Pupils who are residents of the district are counted. This is the sum of adjusted ADA, aidable pupils with special educational needs, weighted publicly placed students with disabilities, and aidable pupils weighted for secondary school, but does not include aidable pupils for summer school. The above items are adjusted for residence as in RWADA. Pupils with Special Educational Needs (PSEN) The number of pupils attending the public schools of the district with special educational needs are those determined by the percentage of pupils below minimum competence as measured by third and sixth grade pupil evaluation program tests (an average score in reading and mathematics from Spring 1985 and Spring 1986 is required). This percentage is multiplied by the district's adjusted ADA to produce the number of eligible pupils for weighting. The additional weighting for eligible pupils is 0.25 pupil units. Pupils with disabilities who have been determined by a Committee on Special Education to require placement as follows: (1) In special class instruction either in a hospital or at home for more than 60 days. The additional weighting for these pupils is 1.7 through 1999-00. (2) In special class instruction or receiving special education services for more than 60 percent of each school day. Sixty percent of each school day is further defined in regulations as a minimum of three hours each day of each week at the elementary level or a minimum of three and one-half hours each day of each week at the secondary level. The additional weighting for these pupils is 1.7. For aids payable in 2000-01 the additional weighting will be 1.68 and for aids payable in 2001-02 it will be 1.65. (3) In resource room services or other special programs for 20 percent or more of a school week. Twenty percent of the week is further defined in regulations as not less than five hours each week at the elementary level. At the secondary level or in a middle school or building that operates on a period basis, the equivalent of five periods per week, but not less than 180 minutes of resource room or other special services or programs is considered equivalent to 20 percent of the week. The additional weighting for these pupils is 0.90. (4) Requiring direct or indirect consultant teacher services, for 2 or more hours per week. The additional weighting for these pupils is 0.90. (5) Starting with 2000-01 Public Excess Cost Aid, a new category will be used to calculate pupils for excess cost aid payment: students receiving special education services or programs for 60% or more of the school day in a regular classroom with non-disabled students. For payment of 2000-01 Public Excess Cost Aid, these students will be weighted at 1.68 as described above plus an additional integrated settings weighting of ,50. This additional weighting however, is not used to compute the Public Excess Cost Save Harmless base  Pupils with Disabilities (Public Excess Cost Aid)   55 and is not included in TWPU or TAPU for expense. Summer School Pupils The number of pupils attending approved programs of instruction operated by the district during the months of July and August of the base year in accordance with the Commissioner's Regulations. The weighting for these pupils is 0.12. The ADA of pupils in grades seven through twelve for whom a district will receive an additional weighting. The additional weighting for these pupils is 0.25. This additional weighting is not provided for pupils with disabilities eligible for Public Excess Cost Aid. The number of student hours of instruction in programs in a public school or BOCES leading to a high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma for pupils under the age of 21 not on a regular day-school register, divided by 1,000. This does not include such pupils enrolled in BOCES programs for which BOCES Aid is claimed. The measure by which formula aid is computed. It includes adjusted average daily attendance, and additional weightings for aidable pupils with special educational needs, aidable summer school pupils, dual enrollment pupils, and secondary school pupils. The pupils counted are all pupils attending a given district whether or not they are residents of that district. Beginning with the 1997-98 aid year, the adjusted ADA and ADA based counts will be obtained by multiplying the base year minus one ADA by an enrollment index. This index measures the change between the base year minus one enrollment and base year enrollment. Other components of TAPU for Aid will be base year minus one data. Districts may use the greater of the 1998-99 TAPU or the average of 1997-98 and 1998-99 TAPU's. This pupil count is used with Approved Operating Expense to determine the expense per pupil of the district. It includes year prior to the base year average daily attendance and additional weightings for pupils with special educational needs, aidable summer pupils, dual enrollment, secondary pupils, and pupils with disabilities. This is the sum of: the number of students attending schools within the districts' boundaries and on the regular day school register; the number of enrolled students eligible for homebound instruction; the number of enrolled non-resident homeless students, and the number of enrolled students educated at the campus school of Hunter College; equivalent attendance, and full-time BOCES handicapped enrollment. The enrollment that is reported is as of the last day of the first attendance period. Beginning in 1999-00, the enrollment of resident pupils in charter schools will be included in public school enrollment for State Aid purposes.  Secondary School Pupil Weighting  Equivalent Attendance  Total Aidable Pupil Units (TAPU for Payment)  T APU for Expense  Public School Enrollment (For State Aid Purposes)   56 Enrollment Index This index measures the change in public school enrollment from one school year to the next and is computed by dividing base year enrollment by year prior to the base year. It is used to compute ADA in the calculation of TAPU for Payment and to calculate the index for Growth Aid. A measure of pupils attending a district compared with maximum possible attendance. It is the number computed to four decimals without rounding when the aggregate days of attendance is divided by the possible aggregate attendance of all pupils in attendance in the district.  Attendance Ratio (for purposes of aid)  B.  WEALTH MEASURES This is determined by dividing the assessed valuation of taxable property of the district by the equalization rate(s) of the city, town(s), or village(s) that make up the school district. Full valuation is generally a larger figure than the assessed value. Assuming that the equalization rates have been accurately established, real property of identical value in separate but similar communities of the state, which have been assessed by diverse local standards, would have the same full valuation. Full Valuation per Resident Weighted Average Daily Attendance, or Weighted Average Daily Attendance Wealth Ratio, is a per pupil measure of the wealth of a district based on the number of pupils who are residents of the district. This is determined by dividing the full value of the district by the resident weighted average daily attendance of the district. Full Valuation per Total Wealth Pupil Units is a per pupil measure of the wealth of a district based on the number of pupils who are residents of a district. This is determined by dividing the full value of the district's real property by the total wealth pupil units of the district. Full Valuation per Resident Public and Nonpublic Pupil is a per pupil measure of the wealth of a district based on the number of pupils who are residents of the district, including resident pupils with disabilities attending approved private schools or the State operated schools at Rome and Batavia, and resident pupils placed in Special Act school districts. This is determined by dividing the full value of the district by the total resident public and nonpublic enrollment of the district. (a) Full valuation of real property in the state is divided by the resident weighted average daily attendance (RWADA) of pupils in the state. District full value per RWADA is compared with the statewide average to give a relative measure of a district's property wealth per student. (b) Full valuation of real property in the state is divided by the total wealth pupil units of the state, a weighted count of resident pupils in the state.  Full Value  FV/RWADA  FV/TWPU  FV/RPNP  Statewide Average Full Value Per Pupil)   57 Districts' full value per TWPU is compared with the statewide average as a measure of district property wealth per resident pupil. Extra weighting is given for students with disabilities and pupils with special educational needs. (c) Full valuation of real property in the State is divided by the total resident public and nonpublic enrollment in the State, including resident pupils with disabilities attending approved private schools or the State operated schools at Rome and Batavia and resident pupils placed in Special Act school districts. Districts' full value per resident enrolled pupil is compared with the statewide average as a measure of district property wealth, for the purposes of calculating one of the Transportation Aid ratios available to districts. District Adjusted Gross Income Adjusted gross income is determined for each individual district of the state by summing the verified New York State adjusted gross income reported by state individual taxpayers by their school district of residence, as verified through the State's income verification system. This is determined by dividing the adjusted gross income of the district by the total wealth pupil units of the district. It is a per pupil measurement of district income wealth. Adjusted gross income of the state is divided by the total wealth pupil units of the state.  Adjusted Gross Income/ TWPU  Statewide Average Adjusted Gross Income Per TWPU Pupil Wealth Ratio  A measure of a district's property wealth per pupil compared to the statewide average property wealth of districts, used as one of two variables in the combined wealth ratio. The pupil wealth ratio is the number, computed to three decimals without rounding, obtained when the actual valuation per TWPU of the school district is divided by the statewide average actual valuation per TWPU.  Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio The alternate pupil wealth ratio is a measure of a district's income wealth per pupil compared to the state average. It is the number, computed to three decimals without rounding, obtained when the adjusted gross income per TWPU of the school district is divided by the statewide average adjusted gross income per TWPU. It and the pupil wealth ratio are used to calculate a combined wealth ratio.  Combined Wealth Ratio  A measure of a district's wealth taking into account both full valuation of the district's real property and the income of residents of the district. It is the number, computed to three decimal places without rounding, obtained when 50 percent of the Pupil Wealth Ratio is added to 50 percent of the Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio.   58 Sharing Ratio A percentage determined by a formula of relevant factors that determines the proportion of State contribution to school districts' expenditures or statutory per pupil formula aid amounts. 1.000 minus the State contribution equals the local contribution to a district's budget. The standard formula for the computation of a sharing ratio is:  1.000 - District Wealth Measure State Average  X  Local Share  C.  LOCAL EXPENDITURES, MEASUREMENTS, AND ADJUSTMENTS Current Year Base Year Local Levy The current year is the school year in which the aid is paid. The base year is the school year prior to the current year. The local levy is the total amount of money to be raised locally by all property and nonproperty taxes, including the portion of the levy attributed to the STAR program. The tax rate is the local levy divided by the full valuation of the district's real property for the same year. It is usually expressed as dollars per $1,000 of full valuation. Approved Operating Expenditures are those operating expenses for the dayto-day operation of the school in the base year excluding certain expenses. Not included are: capital outlay and debt service for building construction, transportation of pupils, expenditures made to purchase services from a Board of Cooperative Educational Services or County Vocational Education and Extension Board, tuition payments to other districts, and expenses for programs which do not conform to law or regulation. Money received as federal aid revenue and State aid for special programs are also deducted from total annual expenditures when computing Approved Operating Expenditures. This figure is obtained by dividing the Approved Operating Expense (AOE) by the district's Total Aidable Pupil Units (TAPU) for expense which includes the additional weightings for children with disabilities. The growth index is the ratio, expressed as a decimal, of the current year's enrollment to the base year's enrollment. If it is greater than .004, the district is eligible to receive Growth Aid. The growth index is based on public school enrollment as reported to the Education Department through the Basic Educational Data System (BEDS). The growth decimal is the excess, if any, of the growth index over .004.
