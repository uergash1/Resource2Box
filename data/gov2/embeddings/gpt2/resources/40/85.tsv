Adobe Dreamweaver             Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 under Windows XP       Developed by   Adobe Systems  (formerly by  Macromedia )       Latest release   CS4 (10.0) /  23 September 2008 ; 144 days ago       Written in   C++       OS   Microsoft Windows ,  Mac OS X       Type   IDE       License   Proprietary       Website   Adobe Dreamweaver Homepage              Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 retail box       Adobe Dreamweaver  is a  web development   application  originally created by Allaire Systems, which was acquired around 1998 by  Macromedia  and is now owned by  Adobe Systems , which acquired Macromedia in 2005.   Dreamweaver is available for both  Mac  and  Windows   operating systems . Recent versions have incorporated support for  web  technologies such as  CSS ,  JavaScript , and various  server-side scripting   languages  and  frameworks  including  ASP.NET ,  ColdFusion ,  JavaServer Pages  (JSP), and  PHP .           Contents       1   Features     1.1   Syntax highlighting       2   Version history   3   Internationalisation and localisation     3.1   Language Availability   3.2   Specific Features for Arabic and Hebrew languages       4   See also   5   Notes   6   External links               [ edit ]   Features   As a  WYSIWYG   Presto -based editor, Dreamweaver can hide the HTML code details of pages from the user, making it possible for non-coders to create web pages and sites. One criticism of this approach is that it can produce  HTML  pages whose file size and amount of HTML code is larger than an optimally hand-coded page would be, which can cause  web browsers  to perform poorly. This can be particularly true because the application makes it very easy to create  table-based layouts . In addition, some web site developers have criticized Dreamweaver in the past for producing code that often does not comply with  W3C  standards, though recent versions have been more compliant. Dreamweaver 8.0 performed poorly on the  Acid2 Test , developed by the  Web Standards Project . However, Adobe has increased the support for CSS and other ways to lay out a page without tables in later versions of the application, with the ability to convert tables to layers and vice versa.   Dreamweaver allows users to preview websites in many browsers, provided that they are installed on their computer. It also has some site management tools, such as the ability to find and replace lines of text or code by whatever parameters specified across the entire site, and a templatisation feature for creating multiple pages with similar structures. The behaviours panel also enables use of basic JavaScript without any coding knowledge.   Dreamweaver can use ""Extensions""  small programs, which any web developer can write (usually in  HTML  and  JavaScript ). Extensions provide added functionality to the software for whoever wants to download and install them. Dreamweaver is supported by a large community of extension developers who make extensions available (both commercial and free) for most web development tasks from simple rollover effects to full-featured shopping carts.   Like  other HTML editors , Dreamweaver edits files locally, then uploads all edited files to the remote web server using  FTP ,  SFTP , or  WebDAV . Dreamweaver CS4 now supports the  Subversion (SVN)  version control system.     [ edit ]   Syntax highlighting   As of version 6, Dreamweaver supports  syntax highlighting  for the following languages out of the box:     ActionScript   Active Server Pages  (ASP). Previous versions supported ASP 1.1. ASP support has been dropped entirely in version CS4.   ASP.NET   C#   Cascading Style Sheets  (CSS)   ColdFusion   EDML   Extensible HyperText Markup Language  (XHTML)   Extensible Markup Language  (XML)   Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations  (XSLT)   HyperText Markup Language  (HTML)   Java   JavaScript   JavaServer Pages  (JSP)   PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor  (PHP)   Visual Basic  (VB)   Visual Basic Script Edition  (VBScript)   Wireless Markup Language  (WML)     It is also possible to add your own language syntax highlighting to its repertoire.   In addition,  code completion  is available for many of these languages.

[ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Specific Features for Arabic and Hebrew languages   The older Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 also features a Middle Eastern version that allows typing Arabic, Persian or Hebrew text (written from right to left) within the code view. Whether the text is fully Middle Eastern (written from right to left) or includes both English and Middle Eastern text (written left to right and right to left), it will be displayed properly in the browser.   The Middle Eastern versions are also available for  Adobe Acrobat ,  Adobe Photoshop ,  Adobe Illustrator ,  Adobe InDesign ,  Adobe InCopy  and for  Adobe Creative Suite  (Design Standard, Design Premium, Web Premium).

Althuogh i have to say that it has some problems in  portoble devices i mean hey nothing is perfect. It occasionaly has some problems in the regular stage. Though it is kind of slow.I still  think it is still pretty good. If I would rate this program I would give  it a 4......

Adobe Dreamweaver             Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 under Windows XP       Developed by   Adobe Systems  (formerly by  Macromedia )       Latest release   CS4 (10.0) /  2008-09-23 ; 151 days ago       Written in   C++       OS   Microsoft Windows ,  Mac OS X       Type   IDE       License   Proprietary       Website   Adobe Dreamweaver Homepage              Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 retail box       Adobe Dreamweaver  is a  web development   application  originally created by Macromedia, and is now developed by  Adobe Systems , who acquired Macromedia in 2005.   Dreamweaver is available for both  Mac  and  Windows   operating systems . Recent versions have incorporated support for  web  technologies such as  CSS ,  JavaScript , and various  server-side scripting   languages  and  frameworks  including  ASP ,  ColdFusion , and  PHP .

One criticism of this approach is that it has the potential to produce  HTML  pages whose file size and amount of HTML code is larger than an optimally hand-coded page would be, which can cause  web browsers  to perform poorly. This can be particularly true because the application makes it very easy to create  table-based layouts . In addition, some web site developers have criticized Dreamweaver in the past for producing code that often does not comply with  W3C  standards, though recent versions have been more compliant. Dreamweaver 8.0 performed poorly on the  Acid2 Test , developed by the  Web Standards Project . However, Adobe has focused on support for standards-based layout in recent and current versions of the application, including the ability to convert tables to layers.   Dreamweaver allows users to preview websites in locally-installed web browsers. It also has site management tools, such as FTP/SFTP and WebDAV file transfer and synchronization features, the ability to find and replace lines of text or code by search terms and regular expressions across the entire site, and a templating feature that allows single-source update of shared code and layout across entire sites without server-side includes or scripting. The behaviours panel also enables use of basic JavaScript without any coding knowledge, and integration with Adobe's Spry AJAX framework offers easy access to dynamically-generated content and interfaces.   Dreamweaver can utilize third-party ""Extensions"" to enable and extend core functionality of the application, which any web developer can write (largely in  HTML  and  JavaScript ). Dreamweaver is supported by a large community of extension developers who make extensions available (both commercial and free) for most web development tasks from simple rollover effects to full-featured shopping carts.   Like  other HTML editors , Dreamweaver edits files locally, then uploads all edited files to the remote web server using  FTP ,  SFTP , or  WebDAV . Dreamweaver CS4 now supports the  Subversion (SVN)  version control system.     [ edit ]   Syntax highlighting   As of version 6, Dreamweaver supports  syntax highlighting  for the following languages out of the box:     ActionScript   Active Server Pages  (ASP). Previous versions supported ASP 1.1. ASP support has been dropped entirely in version CS4.   ASP.NET   C#   Cascading Style Sheets  (CSS)   ColdFusion   EDML   Extensible HyperText Markup Language  (XHTML)   Extensible Markup Language  (XML)   Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations  (XSLT)   HyperText Markup Language  (HTML)   Java   JavaScript   JavaServer Pages  (JSP)   PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor  (PHP)   Visual Basic  (VB)   Visual Basic Script Edition  (VBScript)   Wireless Markup Language  (WML)     It is also possible to add your own language syntax highlighting to its repertoire.   In addition,  code completion  is available for many of these languages.

Whether the text is fully Middle Eastern (written from right to left) or includes both English and Middle Eastern text (written left to right and right to left), it will be displayed properly in the browser.   The Middle Eastern versions are also available for  Adobe Acrobat ,  Adobe Photoshop ,  Adobe Illustrator ,  Adobe InDesign ,  Adobe InCopy  and for  Adobe Creative Suite  (Design Standard, Design Premium, Web Premium).

Its primary purpose is to link the parts of the Creative Suite together using a format similar to the file browser found in previous versions of  Adobe Photoshop . It is accessible from all other components of the Creative Suite (except for the standalone version of Adobe Acrobat 8). [ 1 ]   Adobe Bridge is also included with the stand-alone  Photoshop  application, [ 2 ]  and can perform certain Photoshop processing functions separately (and simultaneously) with Photoshop itself.   Adobe Bridge allowed for access to  Adobe Stock Photos , an online collection of  stock photography images  drawn from well-known stock photo houses. [ 3 ]  However, the service was discontinued by Adobe on April 1, 2008. [ 4 ]   Bridge has many functions such as batch rename and other utilities to help with organization, and supports editing of digital images in  Camera Raw  format. Organizational features include assigning colored labels or star ratings to images, the ability to edit the  XMP  and  IPTC Information Interchange Model   metadata  embedded within an image file, and the ability to work with different versions and alternates of a file that is part of an  Adobe Version Cue  project.   Image files can be shown in different sized thumbnails, slide shows or lists. Each folder, which can be bookmarked, has a cache file for speeding up rendering time of images when viewing a thumbnail. The cache can be in one central location or in individual folders. [ 5 ]   Adobe Bridge is extensively customizable using  JavaScript . [ 6 ]  The Adobe Stock Photos service is implemented as a Bridge Extension. The Bridge scripting guide is available online as well as in paperback.

clueweb09-enwp00-15-10864	"                     Adobe InCopy          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search            Adobe InCopy             Adobe InCopy CS2 running on Windows XP       Developed by   Adobe Systems       Latest release   CS4 (6.0) /  Template:Please edit this as it is currently unknown       OS   Mac OS X ,  Microsoft Windows       Type   Word processor       License   Proprietary       Website   http://www.adobe.com/products/incopy/       Adobe InCopy  is a professional  word processing software  made by  Adobe Systems . It is integrated to  Adobe InDesign ; the current version is Adobe InCopy CS4. This desktop publishing software is primarily used to publish newspapers and magazines.   InDesign allows the editor to write, edit, and design (style, font, etc.) the publishable copy. The software includes standard word processing features such as "" spell check "", ""track changes"", and ""word count"", etc., and has preview viewing modes for fitting copy to the text layout, allowing the editor to visually ascertain every design element fits in the publication layout format used.   Commercially, InCopy is a direct competitor to  Quark CopyDesk , which was first released in 1991.

The Story mode  is for text reading and editing in a screen-wide, word-processor view  without  the publication page formatting. The  Galley mode  view displays the text in a word processing view without page formatting but with line numbers and the same line breaks as in the layout. Both Galley and Story views reveal text that is overset in Layout view, and show the names of the  style sheets  applied to the text; but do not display the  actual  formatting. The  Layout mode  shows the true page design layout displaying  every  format applied to the text and all the images.   Although InCopy can be used as a word processor (with full printing and exporting functions), it is primarily used to integrate with the  Adobe Systems   InDesign   desktop publishing  software application.   With InCopy integrated with InDesign, writers, editors, and designers can simultaneously work the same page; the designer creates the page layout with InDesign, while editors simultaneously edit different stories with InCopy, via the Adobe LiveEdit rights management system. Publishers often use a  publishing system  including workflow- and rights management to the design and editing capabilities of the publishing system software.     [ edit ]   Internationalization and localization     [ edit ]   Language availability   Adobe InCopy is available in the following languages: Arabic (Middle Eastern version), Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew (Middle Eastern version), Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.   Adobe InCopy Middle Eastern versions available from WinSoft  [ 1 ] ,  Adobe Systems   Internationalization and localization  partner.     [ edit ]   Specific features for Arabic and Hebrew languages   The Middle Eastern versions are specifically developed for Arabic and Hebrew languages.     [ edit ]   Text settings   InCopy Middle Eastern versions come with special settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text, such as:     Possibility to use Arabic,  Persian  or Hindi digits   Use kashidas for letter spacing and full justification   Ligature option   Set vowels /diacritics positioning   Justify text in three possible ways to get the results you want (Standard, Arabic, Naskh)   Option to ""Insert Special Character"": three Hebrew characters (Geresh, Gershayim, Magaf) and an Arabic one (Kashida)   Apply standard, Arabic or Hebrew styles for page, paragraph and footnote numbering       [ edit ]   Bi-directional text flow   In InCopy Middle Eastern versions, the notion of right-to-left behaviour applies to several objects: Story, Paragraph, Character and Table. You can easily mix Right-to-Left and Left-to-Right Words, Paragraphs and Stories in a document.     [ edit ]   Dictionary and hyphenation module   InCopy Middle Eastern versions come with a comprehensive dictionary for Arabic allowing you to spell check Arabic text with a choice of rules, like Strict Aleef Hamza, Strict Final Yaa, both or none. Depending on your system capabilities, InCopy comes with a Dictionary and Hyphenation Module for Hebrew.     [ edit ]   Enhanced font support   InCopy Middle Eastern versions support most fonts shipped with the OS as well as a large number of third party fonts widely used by graphic designers in the Middle Eastern regions.     [ edit ]   Find/change   You can search for and change specific occurrences of Middle Eastern characters, words, groups of words, or text formatted a certain way across a selection, one or more stories, a document, or multiple open documents. You can also search for other items, including  OpenType  attributes such as fractions and swashes.     [ edit ]   Importing and exporting   InCopy Middle Eastern versions bring the capability of opening directly and converting  QuarkXPress  files, even using Arabic XT, Arabic Phonyx or Hebrew QXPressWay fonts, retaining the layout and content. InCopy Middle Eastern versions come with more than 50 import/export filters enabling you to place many kinds of images and Roman texts:  Microsoft Word  97-98-2000 Import filter and Text Import filter. The Middle Eastern versions are also available for  Adobe Acrobat ,  Adobe Illustrator ,  Adobe Photoshop ,  Adobe InDesign ,  Adobe Dreamweaver ,  Adobe Creative Suite  (Design Standard, Design Premium, Web Premium).     [ edit ]   Availability   Although its title includes ""CS4"", the software is not included as part of Adobe's  Creative Suite  package. InCopy is now sold as a retail package, and may be ordered from Adobe, third party plug-in developers, or systems integrators.

clueweb09-en0002-47-00725	"                     Digital rights management          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Digital Rights Management )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Digital rights management  ( DRM ) is a generic term that refers to  access control  technologies used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, and  copyright  holders to limit usage of digital media or devices. The term is used to describe any technology which makes the unauthorized use of media or devices technically formidable and generally doesn't include other forms of  copy protection  which can be circumvented without modifying the media or device, such as  serial numbers  or  keyfiles . It can also refer to restrictions associated with specific instances of digital works or devices.   Digital rights management has been and is being used by content provider companies such as  Sony ,  Apple Inc. ,  Microsoft  and the  BBC .   The use of digital rights management is controversial. Advocates argue it is necessary for copyright holders to prevent unauthorized duplication of their work to ensure continued revenue streams. [ 1 ]  Some opponents, such as the  Free Software Foundation , maintain that the use of the word ""rights"" is misleading and suggest that people instead use the term  Digital Restrictions Management . Their position is essentially that copyright holders are attempting to restrict use of copyrighted material in ways not covered by existing laws. [ 2 ]  The  Electronic Frontier Foundation , and other opponents, also consider DRM systems to be  anti-competitive practices . [ 3 ]   In practice, all widely-used DRM systems have been defeated or circumvented when deployed to enough customers. [ 4 ]  Restricting the copying of audio and visual material is especially difficult due to the existence of the  analog hole , and there are even suggestions that effective DRM is logically impossible for this reason.

Long before the arrival of digital or even electronic media, copyright holders, content producers, or other financially or artistically interested parties had business and legal objections to copying technologies. Examples include:  player piano  rolls early in the 20th century,  audio tape recording , and  video tape recording  (e.g. the "" Betamax case "" in the  U.S. ). Copying technology thus exemplifies a  disruptive technology .   The advent of digital media and analog/digital conversion technologies, especially those that are usable on mass-market general-purpose personal computers, have vastly increased the concerns of copyright-dependent organizations, especially within the music and movie industries. While  analog  media inevitably loses quality with each  copy generation , and in some cases even during normal use, digital media files may be duplicated an unlimited number of times with no degradation in the quality of subsequent copies. The advent of  personal computers  as household appliances has made it convenient for consumers to convert media (which may or may not be copyrighted) originally in a physical/analog form or a broadcast form into a universal, digital form (this process is called  ripping ) for location- or  timeshifting , combined with the  Internet  and popular  file sharing  tools, has made unauthorized distribution of copies of copyrighted digital media (so-called  digital piracy ) much easier. In effect, copyright-dependent organizations regard every consumer with an Internet connection as a potential node of a distribution network that could be used to distribute unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.   Although technical controls on the reproduction and use of software have been intermittently used since the 1970s, the term 'DRM' has come to primarily mean the use of these measures to control artistic or literary content. [ citation needed ]  DRM technologies have enabled publishers to enforce access policies that not only disallow  copyright infringements , but also prevent lawful  fair use  of copyrighted works, or even implement use constraints on non-copyrighted works that they distribute; examples include the placement of DRM on certain  public-domain  or  open-licensed  e-books, or DRM included in consumer electronic devices that time-shift (and apply DRM to) both copyrighted and non-copyrighted works.   While DRM is most commonly used by the  entertainment industry  ( e.g.   film  and  recording ), it has found use in other situations as well. Many  online music stores , such as  Apple 's  iTunes Store , as well as certain  e-book  publishers, have imposed DRM on their customers. In recent years, a number of  television producers  have imposed DRM mandates on consumer electronic devices, to control access to the freely-broadcast content of their shows, in connection with the popularity of time-shifting  digital video recorder  systems such as  TiVo . [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Technologies     [ edit ]   DRM and film   An early example of a DRM system was the  Content Scrambling System  (CSS) employed by the  DVD Forum  on film  DVDs  since  ca.  1996. CSS used a simple  encryption algorithm , and required device manufacturers to sign  license agreements  that restricted the inclusion of features, such as digital outputs that could be used to extract high-quality digital copies of the film, in their players. Thus, the only consumer hardware capable of decoding DVD films was controlled, albeit indirectly, by the DVD Forum, restricting the use of DVD media on other systems until the release of  DeCSS  by  Jon Lech Johansen  in 1999, which allowed a CSS-encrypted DVD to play properly on a computer using  Linux , for which the Alliance had not arranged a licensed version of the CSS playing  software .   Microsoft 's  Windows Vista  contains a DRM system called the  Protected Media Path , which contains the Protected Video Path (PVP). PVP tries to stop DRM-restricted content from playing while unsigned software is running in order to prevent the unsigned software from accessing the content. Additionally, PVP can encrypt information during transmission to the monitor or the graphics card, which makes it more difficult to make unauthorized recordings.   Advanced Access Content System  (AACS) is a DRM system for  HD DVD  and  Blu-Ray Discs  developed by the AACS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a  consortium  that includes  Disney ,  Intel ,  Microsoft ,  Matsushita  (Panasonic),  Warner Brothers ,  IBM ,  Toshiba  and  Sony . In December 2006 a process key was published on the internet by  crackers , enabling unrestricted access to AACS-restricted HD DVD content. [ 6 ]  After the cracked keys were revoked, further cracked keys were released. [ 7 ]   The  broadcast flag  concept was developed by Fox Broadcasting in 2001 and was supported by the  MPAA  and the  FCC . A ruling in May 2005 by a US Court of Appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether or not a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as  time-shifting . [ citation needed ]  It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufactures, network operators, software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.   An updated variant of the broadcast flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management ( DVB-CPCM ). It was developed in private, and the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, at the direction of the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the  EFF , which paid to be a member of the consortium, ""You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices"". [ 8 ]  The DVB supports the system as it will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies and so make things easier for end users. The CPCM system is expected to be submitted to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in 2008.     [ edit ]   DRM and music     [ edit ]   Audio CDs   Discs with digital rights management schemes are not legitimately standards-compliant  Compact Discs  (CDs) but are rather CD-ROM media. Therefore they all lack the CD logotype found on discs which follow the standard (known as  Red Book ). Therefore these CDs could not be played on all  CD players . Many consumers could also no longer play purchased CDs on their computers.  PCs  running  Microsoft Windows  would sometimes even crash when attempting to play the CDs. [ 9 ]   In 2002,  Bertelsmann  (comprising  BMG ,  Arista , and  RCA ) was the first corporation to use DRM on audio CDs. [ citation needed ]  In 2005,  Sony BMG introduced new DRM technology  which installed DRM software on users' computers without clearly notifying the user or requiring confirmation. Among other things, the installed software included a  rootkit , which created a severe security vulnerability others could exploit. When the nature of the DRM involved was made public much later, Sony initially minimized the significance of the vulnerabilities its software had created, but was eventually compelled to recall millions of CDs, and released several attempts to patch the surreptitiously included software to at least remove the rootkit. Several  class action lawsuits  were filed, which were ultimately settled by agreements to provide affected consumers with a cash payout or album downloads free of DRM. [ 10 ]   Sony's DRM software actually had only a limited ability to prevent copying, as it affected only playback on Windows computers, not on other equipment. Even on the Windows platform, users regularly bypassed the restrictions. And, while the Sony DRM technology created fundamental vulnerabilities in customers' computers, parts of it could be trivially bypassed by holding down the ""shift"" key while inserting the CD, or by disabling the  autorun  feature. In addition, audio tracks could simply be played and re-recorded, thus completely bypassing all of the DRM (this is known as the  analog hole ). Sony's first two attempts at releasing a  patch  which would remove the DRM software from users' computers failed.   In January 2007,  EMI  stopped publishing audio CDs with DRM, stating that ""the costs of DRM do not measure up to the results."" EMI was the last publisher to do so, and audio CDs containing DRM are no longer released by any major record labels. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Internet music   Many online music stores employ DRM to restrict usage of music purchased and downloaded online. There are many options for consumers buying digital music over the internet, in terms of both stores and purchase options.     The  iTunes Store , run by Apple Inc., allows users to purchase a track online for $.99 US. The tracks purchased use Apple's  FairPlay  DRM system. Apple later launched  iTunes Plus , which offered higher quality DRM-free tracks for a higher price. On October 17, 2007, iTunes Plus became available at the usual $.99 price, replacing the non-Plus tracks. [ 12 ] . As of January 6, 2009 Apple had announced at their keynote that iTunes will be completely DRM free by the end of the month.       Napster music store , which offers a subscription-based approach to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to  Windows Media Audio (WMA)  while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all of the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews his or her subscription. Napster also charges users who wish to use the music on their portable device an additional $5 per month. In addition, Napster gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through Napster can be played on players carrying the  Microsoft PlaysForSure  logo (which, notably, do not include  iPods  or even Microsoft's own  Zune ). Now Napster is giving DRM free MP3 music.       Wal-Mart Music Downloads, another online music download store, charges $0.94 per track for all non-sale downloads. All Wal-Mart, Music Downloads are able to be played on any Windows PlaysForSure marked product. The music does play on the  SanDisk 's  Sansa   mp3 player , for example, but must be copied to the player's  internal memory . It cannot be played through the player's  microSD  card slot, which is a problem that many users of the mp3 player experience.       Sony  operated an online music download service called "" Connect "" which used Sony's proprietary  OpenMG  DRM technology. Music downloaded from this store (usually via Sony's  SonicStage  software) was only playable on computers running  Windows  and Sony hardware (including the  PSP ).     The various services are currently not interoperable, though those that use the same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need  plug-ins . Several colleges and  universities , such as  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. [ 13 ]  One of the problems is that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The  Gowers Review of Intellectual Property  (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8 -- 12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some of the acrimony may decrease.   Although DRM is prevalent for Internet music, some  Online music stores  such as  eMusic ,  Dogmazic ,  Amazon , and  Beatport , do not use DRM despite encouraging users to avoid sharing music. Another online retailer, Xiie.net, which sells only unsigned artists, encourages people to share the music they buy from the site, to increase exposure for the artists themselves. Major labels have begun releasing more online music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that this is because the record labels are ""slowly beginning to realize that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store."" [ 14 ]  Apple's  Steve Jobs  has called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled  Thoughts on Music . [ 15 ]  Apple's iTunes store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s) music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price). In March 2007, Musicload.de, one of Europe's largest online music retailers, announced their position strongly against DRM. In an open letter, Musicload stated that three out of every four calls to their customer support phone service are as a result of consumer frustration with DRM. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Computer games   Computer games sometimes use DRM technologies to limit the number of systems the game can be installed on. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs. This limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (Seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them to limit the number of installations). These technologies are intended to benefit the game developers, decreasing piracy while increasing profits. Sometimes the restrictive DRM scheme backfires and a large number of users decide not to pay for the game, seeking a pirated version instead. The most recent such case involved the DRM topology  SecuROM  used in  Spore ,  BioShock  and  Mass Effect . The backlash against SecuROM was a significant factor in  Spore  becoming the most pirated game in 2008. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   E-books   Electronic books  read on a  personal computer  or an  e-book reader  typically use DRM restrictions to limit copying, printing, and sharing of e-books. E-books are usually limited to a certain number of reading devices and some e-publishers prevent any copying or printing. Some commentators believe that DRM is a reason why the E-book has been a marketing failure. [ 19 ]   Two of the most commonly used software programs to view e-books are  Adobe Acrobat  and  Microsoft Reader . [ 20 ]  Each program uses a slightly different approach to content protection. The first version of Adobe Acrobat e-book Reader to have encryption technologies was version 5.05. In the later version 6.0, the technologies of the PDF reader and the e-book reader were combined, allowing it to read both DRM-restricted and unrestricted files. [ 21 ]  After opening the file, the user is able to view the rights statement, which outlines actions available for the specific document. For example, for a freely transferred  PDF , printing, copying to the clipboard, and other basic functions are available to the user. However, when viewing a more highly restricted  e-book , the user is unable to print the book, copy or paste selections. [ 21 ]  The level of restriction is specified by the publisher or distribution agency. [ 22 ]   Microsoft Reader , which exclusively reads e-books in a .lit format, contains its own DRM software. In Microsoft Reader there are three different levels of access control depending on the e-book: sealed e-books, inscribed e-books and owner exclusive e-books. Sealed e-books have the least amount of restriction and only prevents the document from being modified. [ 23 ]  Therefore, the reader cannot alter the content of the book to change the ending, for instance. Inscribed e-books are the next level of restriction. After purchasing and downloading the e-book, Microsoft Reader puts a digital ID tag to identify the owner of the e-book. Therefore, this discourages distribution of the e-book because it is inscribed with the owners name making it possible to trace it back to the original copy that was distributed. [ 24 ]  Other e-book software uses similar DRM schemes. For example, Palm Digital Media, now known as  Ereader , links the credit card information of the purchaser to the e-book copy in order to discourage distribution of the books. [ 25 ]   The most stringent form of security that Microsoft Reader offers is called owner exclusive e-books, which uses traditional DRM technologies. To buy the e-book the consumer must first open Microsoft Reader, which ensures that when the book is downloaded it becomes linked to the computers  Microsoft Passport  account. Thus the e-book can only be opened with the computer with which it was downloaded, preventing copying and distribution of the text. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   DRM and documents   Enterprise digital rights management  ( E-DRM  or  ERM ) is the application of DRM technology to the control of access to corporate documents such as  Microsoft Word ,  PDF , and  AutoCAD  files, emails, and  intranet  web pages rather than to the control of consumer media. [ 27 ]  E-DRM, now more commonly referenced as IRM ( Information Rights Management ), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as  industrial or corporate espionage  or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents. IRM typically integrates with  content management  system software.   DRM has been used by organizations such as the  British Library  in its  secure electronic delivery service  to permit worldwide access to substantial numbers of rare (and in many cases unique) documents which, for legal reasons, were previously only available to authorized individuals actually visiting the Library's document centre at Boston Spa in England. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Watermarks   Digital watermarks  are unobtrusive features of media that are added during production or distribution. Digital watermarks involve data that is arguably  steganographically  embedded within the audio or video data.   Watermarks can be used for different purposes that may include:     for recording the copyright owner   for recording the distributor   for recording the distribution chain   for identifying the purchaser of the music     Watermarks are not complete DRM mechanisms in their own right, but are used as part of a system for Digital Rights Management, such as helping provide prosecution evidence for purely legal avenues of rights management, rather than direct technological restriction. Some programs used to edit video and/or audio may distort, delete, or otherwise interfere with watermarks. Signal/modulator-carrier chromatography may also separate watermarks from original audio or detect them as glitches. Use of third party media players and other advanced programs render watermarking useless. Additionally, comparison of two separately obtained copies of audio using simple, home-grown algorithms can often reveal watermarks. New methods of detection are currently under investigation by both industry and non-industry researchers.     [ edit ]   Metadata   Sometimes,  metadata  is included in purchased music which records information such as the purchaser's name, account information, or email address. This information is not embedded in the played audio or video data, like a watermark, but is kept separate, but within the file or stream.   As an example, metadata is used in media purchased from Apple's iTunes Store for DRM-free as well as DRM-restricted versions of their music or videos. This information is included as MPEG standard metadata.

[ edit ]   Laws regarding DRM   Digital rights management systems have received some international legal backing by implementation of the 1996  WIPO Copyright Treaty  (WCT). Article 11 of the Treaty requires nations party to the treaties to enact laws against DRM circumvention.   The WCT has been implemented in most member states of the  World Intellectual Property Organization . The American implementation is the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act  (DMCA), while in Europe the treaty has been implemented by the 2001  European directive on copyright , which requires member states of the  European Union  to implement legal protections for technological prevention measures. In 2006 [update] , the lower house of the French parliament adopted such legislation as part of the controversial  DADVSI  law, but added that protected DRM techniques should be made interoperable, a move which caused widespread controversy in the United States.     [ edit ]   Digital Millennium Copyright Act       Main article:  Digital Millennium Copyright Act       The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is an extension to  United States   copyright law  passed unanimously on  May 14 ,  1998 , which criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology that allows users to circumvent technical copy-restriction methods. Under the Act, circumvention of a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work is illegal if done with the primary intent of violating the rights of copyright holders. (For a more detailed analysis of the statute, see  WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act .)   Reverse engineering of existing systems is expressly permitted under the Act under specific conditions. Under the reverse engineering safe harbor, circumvention necessary to achieve interoperability with other software is specifically authorized. See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(f). Open-source software to decrypt content scrambled with the Content Scrambling System and other encryption techniques presents an intractable problem with the application of the Act. Much depends on the intent of the actor. If the decryption is done for the purpose of achieving interoperability of open source operating systems with proprietary operating systems, the circumvention would be protected by Section 1201(f) the Act. Cf., Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001) at notes 5 and 16. However, dissemination of such software for the purpose of violating or encouraging others to violate copyrights has been held illegal. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).   On  22 May   2001 , the European Union passed the  EU Copyright Directive , an implementation of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty that addressed many of th  "

I'm sorta new at making audio media, and this     was a big help. I just wanted to make some cassette tapes into CDs     (MP3s), and looked for hours for the right recorder. This one, after     downloading the demo, was obviously the best choice. And the price     is great too.

I'm sorta new at making audio media, and this     was a big help. I just wanted to make some cassette tapes into CDs     (MP3s), and looked for hours for the right recorder. This one, after     downloading the demo, was obviously the best choice. And the price     is great too.

Visit the  Beyond TV System Requirements  page                         to determine if your computer meets the minimum requirements                         to run Beyond TV. At a high level, to run Beyond TV you                         will need a TV tuner card and enough hard disk space to                         record MPEG-2 shows.                        Is there a monthly or yearly                           subscription fee for Beyond TV?                                              There are no subscription fees for the retail and online                         versions of Beyond TV.                         Select TV tuner cards from manufacturers like Diamond                         Multimedia and Visiontek include Beyond TV Subscription                         Edition (SE). Beyond TV SE may require a subscription fee.                        How much do upgrades to Beyond                           TV cost?                                             Point releases to Beyond TV (for example, upgrading from                         Beyond TV 4.1 to Beyond TV 4.2) are free. Existing users                         can  download                         updates  for Beyond TV 4 now.                         Major version releases (for example, an upgrade from Beyond                         TV 3 to Beyond TV 4) typically involve an upgrade fee.                        Will Beyond TV work without an                           Internet connection?                                             Beyond TV works with dial-up and broadband Internet connections                         alike.                         If you don't have an Internet connection, the core functionality                         of Beyond TV will still work but certain features such                         as the SnapStream.Net program guide and remote recordings                         will be limited or will not work.                                                                            Section                         2: Hardware and Software Compatibility                                                    Is Beyond TV                           compatible with my notebook computer?                                              Yes, Beyond TV works on notebook computers                         through the use of a USB 2.0 TV tuner device. One problem                         you might potentially have with running Beyond TV on a                         laptop is your graphics card because laptop graphics cards                         tend to be underpowered. Visit the  Beyond                         TV System Requirements  page for more information.                        Will Beyond                           TV work in my living room with my remote control?                                             Yes. Beyond TV is 100% remote control                           compatible, so you don’t need a keyboard or mouse                           to enjoy it. If you have a PC remote, like the Firefly                           PC Remote you can use Beyond TV from the comfort of                           your couch. Other compatible remotes include the StreamZap                           and                           ATI Remote Wonder. You can use other remote controls                           with Beyond TV with key-mapping software such as Girder.                        Will Beyond                           TV work with my mouse or keyboard?                                            Yes. While Beyond TV is optimized for                         use in the living room, you can use it in a desktop setup                         with your mouse and/or keyboard as well.                                              Will Beyond                           TV work with my digital cable or satellite?                                                                  Yes, Beyond TV works with most digital                         cable and satellite systems in the U.S. and Canada.                         Setup for digital cable and satellite                         television is a little more complex than analog cable or                         antenna setup. To enable Beyond TV to change channels on                         your digital cable or satellite set-top box you need an                         additional connection between your set-top box and your                         PC so that Beyond TV can change channels on your set-top                         box. This is done either through  serial tuning  or  IR                         blasting .                         Serial tuning  is the most reliable,                         if your box supports it (most DirecTV system and boxes                         support serial port tuning). As far as  IR blasters  go,                         some TV tuner cards—such as the Hauppauge PVR-150—include                         IR blasters with built-in code libraries though you can                         also use something like the USB-UIRT for IR blasting.                         See the  knowledgebase  and                         the  Beyond                         TV help file  for more information on serial tuning                         and IR blasters.                        Can Beyond TV                           record from multiple TV tuner cards?                                            Yes, support for recording from multiple                         tuners became available with Beyond TV 3.5 and later. The                         tuner devices in a multiple-tuner setup must all be hardware-encoding                         TV tuners. See sample articles on  10                         TV tuner (Hydra)  and  6                         TV tuner (Medusa)  PCs built with SnapStream Beyond                         TV. Also, see the knowledge base for more information on  multiple                         tuner support .                        Can I watch                           one channel while recording another or record from two                           channels at once?                                          Yes, with multiple tuners in your Beyond                         TV PC, you can watch one live TV show while you record                         another or simultaneously record two (or more if you have                         more than 2 tuners) live TV shows.                        Can I watch                           a recorded show while Beyond TV is recording a new show?                                             Yes. Shows that have already been recorded                         are simply video files and do not require the use of the                         TV tuner card.                        Can Beyond TV record in Dolby                           surround-sound?                                             Yes, but it depends on the broadcast. If a show is broadcast                           with Dolby Digital audio, Beyond TV will record it                         in that format. With Beyond TV 4’s support for                         high-definition television (HDTV), you can now record                         Dolby surround-sound                           in high-definition programming as well. Depending on                         your audio capabilities, you may also be able to configure                         your                           computer to record and playback standard, analog TV                         shows in stereo as well.                        Does Beyond TV work with the                           Macintosh or Linux systems?                                           Beyond TV is currently only compatible with Windows™ XP                         Home, Pro, Media Center Edition, Windows™ 2000 and Vista. There are currently                         no plans to create a Macintosh or Linux version.                                                                                                  Section                         3: Features                                                   What video file                           formats does Beyond TV support?                                               Beyond TV can record live TV in the                         default MPEG-2 (.MPG) format, DivX format, Windows                         Media (.WMV)                         format or H.264                         format.                         Your TV tuner card can limit what formats                         you can record directly to -- for example, most MPEG-2                         hardware encode cards can only record directly to the MPEG-2                         format (which isn't a bad thing -- these are the most popular                         type of cards among our customers). By the same token,                         some of Plextor ConvertX TV cards support recording to                         both the DivX format and to the MPEG-2 format.                         Finally, if you have a TV card without                         any hardware encoding, you can pick to record directly                         to MPEG-2, Windows Media or DivX (though this will increase                         your CPU requirements).                         Regardless of what format you record                         to, you can always use ShowSqueeze to convert recordings                         to other formats (either to save disk space or to make                         shows portable).                          How much hard                           drive space do I need?                                              The size of a recording depends upon the                         file format, its length and the Beyond TV quality profile                         selected for making the recording.                         Use the charts below to determine how much                         your system can record.

Yes. With Beyond TV 4's DVD                           Burning, you can seamlessly record                         TV shows with Beyond TV and then burn them to video or                         data                         DVDs.                           How does ShowSqueeze™ work?                                              ShowSqueeze™ is how Beyond TV converts a recording                         from one format and size to another. ShowSqueeze™ allows                         you to save disk space and make your shows more portable.                         Beyond TV 4 allows you to ShowSqueeze™ Windows                         Media files (.wmv), MPEG-2 files (.mpg), MPEG-2 Transport                         Streams (.ts)                           and DivX files (.avi) to the Windows                         Media format or DivX (.avi). Additionally, you are                         able to ShowSqueeze™ your                         recordings to the H.264 format.                         ShowSqueeze™ can be setup as a system-wide setting                         or it can be configured to only run on certain recording                         jobs. ShowSqueeze™ can also be configured to run                         during off-peak hours, which you can specify, or it can                         be configured to run as soon as a recording is made.                          How does SmartSkip™ work?                                            Beyond TV’s SmartSkip™ feature detects where                         commercials and other breaks are located in a recorded                         show. Then when you play back your recording, you can                         jump between the different segments with the simple press                         of                         a button.                         SmartSkip™ runs as a post-process job, after your                         recordings are made. Like ShowSqueeze™, SmartSkip™ can                         be configured to run immediately after recordings are made                         or during off-peak hours. Depending on the power of your                         PC's processor, SmartSkip™ might take 1 hour to                         run on a 1 hour show, or it might take only 30 minutes.                         And when you burn DVDs of your favorite shows with the DVD burning feature, SmartSkip™ chapters                           get created on your DVD as well.                          Can I change video quality settings?                           (recording bit-rate, resolution, and other parameters)                                            Yes, recording quality is highly customizable in Beyond                         TV, but only for analog capture. The ""Recording Preferences"" section                         of the ""Configure"" screen in the Web Admin                         interface provides access to these settings. This is                         extensively                         documented in the  Beyond                         TV Help File .                          How can I use Beyond TV on a                           television in my living room?                                             As mentioned above, Beyond TV works great in the living                         room. There are a number of ways you can do use Beyond                         TV in the living room.                         You can build or buy a home theater PC (HTPC), put it                         in your living room with your other home entertainement                         components, and connect it directly to your television.                         To do this, you would need a video card that includes TV-OUT                         connection.                         You can also connect an inexpensive digital media adapter                         (such as Hauppauge's MediaMVP) to your living room television                         and use it to share TV shows recorded in Beyond TV over                         your home network. Because Beyond TV uses standard MPEG-2                         to record TV shows, this works pretty well. MediaMVP users                         should also see the posting on our blog about the  MediaMVP                         Beyond TV Interface .                          How does Beyond                           TV’s remote recording feature work?                                             With Beyond TV's SnapStream.Net service, you can schedule                         recordings while you are away from home. You can schedule                         remote recordings from an PC web browser at  http://www.snapstream.net/  and                         on any mobile device with web access at  http://mobile.snapstream.net/ .                         Remote recordings are retrieved by Beyond TV every thirty                         minutes by default.                          When will guide data for my                           country be supported by Beyond TV?                                              Beyond TV currently includes an integrated program guide                         for the United States and Canada, through the SnapStream.Net                         service.                         With tvtv, a web-based electronic program guide geared                         toward European countries, SnapStream's Beyond TV includes                         support for Germany, Austria, Switzerland, UK, France,                         Italy, Spain, Netherlands.                          There is also third party support for something called                         XMLTV. With  3rd                         party XMLTV support , you can get integrated (as opposed                         to web-based) EPG support for many different countries                         around the world.                          How does tvtv work with Beyond                           TV?                                             Our electronic program guide and tvtv’s are similar                         in function. When you run the setup wizard for Beyond TV,                         and enter your home country, Beyond TV will ask if you                         want to use tvtv. You must then register with tvtv on their                         website. Then, you can schedule recordings on the tvtv                         website. Beyond TV pulls your recording requests from tvtv                         and executes them as if you were using Beyond TV’s                         own program guide.

I want to record straight to                           DivX. How fast a processor do I need?                                           Based on internal testing, the minimum requirement for                         DivX software encode is a 2.4 GHz P4 processor. With that                         processor it's possible to record and playback DivX Portable                         (Medium). Anything above that quality level may max out                         the CPU and cause dropped frames or sluggish PC performance.                         Prescott processors, however, can encode up to our highest                         quality, DivX Home Theater (Highest), without any problems.                         The slowest Prescott that we have tested this on is a 2.8                         GHz HT model.                                                                                                Section                         4: Support for digital / HDTV                            How much better                           will HDTV look and sound than standard TV?                                             HDTV’s major appeal is its sharper                         and wider image display accompanied by award-winning                         Dolby Digital (AC-3) audio. HDTV is completely free of                         signal                         degradation and bleeding. Aspect ratios in HDTV also                         differ greatly from standard analog or cable television.                         Once                         you have experienced the higher clarity, crisp digital                         sound and life-like pictures of HDTV, we don't think                         you’ll                         never want to go back to a standard-definition television.

DVD burning is a great way to preserve your TV recordings. DVDs  tend to be more durable than their VHS counterparts, and it's unlikely  that you'll accidentally record over the latest episode of The Office.                             What  DVD burners are                         supported?                           Pretty much any drive that can burn a DVD should work with Beyond TV's                           DVD Burning & H.264 Plug-in. The plug-in                           uses burning technology from Sonic Solutions, the same burning technology                           used                           by Microsoft                           (in Windows XP and Vista), Adobe and many other companies. So this technology                           is well-proven.

Finally, if you are burning a data DVD, it's simply a matter of the                         file size of the shows you are trying to burn and the space available                         on the                         DVD.                                                                        Will my SmartSkip chapters get                         burned to DVD?                           Yes, if SmartSkip has run on your recordings, they will be burned to                         DVD. With a video DVD, SmartSkip chapters are created as DVD chapters                         within                         a particular show so you can press ""next chapter"" on your                         DVD player to skip commercials. With a data DVD, the SmartSkip data                         file is                         simply copied along with the show to the DVD.

Introduction.   TV-tuner, or a TV-card, is a device that allows users to watch TV on a  computer. There are different types of TV-tuners on the market, including  internal (an extension card that should be plugged into a free PCI slot inside  the computer case) and external ones (a box that can be connected to a computer  through USB, Firewire, or any other appropriate interface). Sometimes TV-tuners  are built into graphic cards, and thus they cannot be perceived as separate  devices. But their function remains just the same: they should receive TV signal  and decode it into the form suitable for monitors or other devices connected to  the computer.   TV-tuners support all features of a TV-set. The user can easily switch  between different channels (almost all TV-tuners come with a remote control),  adjust color settings, view TV-text information etc. But they also provide  additional functionality: the user can record TV shows without purchasing  additional devices (like VCR or DVD recorders). A TV show can be encoded on the  fly and recorded to the hard drive in a highly compatible form of AVI file.   You can record TV shows on your computer with the help of  AVS TV Box .   Step 1: Download and install the program.   Download AVS TV Box  to a known location. Run the downloaded setup package and  follow on-screen instructions to install the application.   Step 2: Start the program. Scan for TV channels.   Launch AVS TV Box. The program should automatically detect your TV tuner. If  you get a message that no TV tuner is found on your system, make sure that  drivers for the device are installed on your system. If necessary, install  drivers from the CD/DVD that comes with your TV tuner, or download the most  recent drivers from the manufacturer's website.   Right click the TV window to get the context menu:       Select ""Settings"". The following window will apper:       AVS TV Box automatically detects a number of parameters on you system, like  country, your sound card etc. If some of the parameters are not correct, you can  adjust them on the ""Device params"" tab.   Click the ""START SCAN CHANNELS"" button and follow instructions to detect TV  channels. Scanning will take some time, depending on the method you choose. It  is recommended to let the program add channels that it finds to the favorites  list automatically.   Step 3: Watch and record TV shows.   After the program has detected channels, you can review other tabs of the  ""Settings"" window. On the ""Paths"" tab, set up folders where recorded shows  should be saved.   On the ""Record"" tab, choose quality for recorded TV shows:       When finished, click ""OK"" to accept all changes and close the window.   Now you can select channels from the Favorites list to watch them:       To record what you see, click the red dot button in the controls area:       But VCR and DVD recorders allow to record TV shows on schedule, so that you  don't need to be home when something interesting is on air. AVS TV Box also has  this functionality. Again, right-click the TV window to get the context menu.  Select ""Schedule"".   The following window will appear:       Click ""Add"" to create a new task for the scheduler.       You can specify a name for the task to recognize it easily in the scheduler's  list. Select the desired action and TV channel to record. Set duration, date and  time. You can schedule a task to be executed only once, or repeatedly on a  certain weekday. Add as many tasks as needed to cover all TV shows that you want  to record.   The trial version of AVS TV Box adds a logo to recorded videos. If you are  satisfied with the functionality and features, you can register your copy and  remove all limitations.   Product Page        Related:    How do I convert AVI to Zune?

Some notebook computers may even come with built in PC to TV converters.        Most teachers in a small to medium sized Sunday School class can get by with a model in the $200 range. A church looking to use one in an auditorium probably needs to get a better quality unit.  If you plan to rebroadcast then you can spend several thousand dollars.  For the medium to small classroom however, since many churches already have large screen TVs then the teacher with a notebook computer (or the church's desktop computer on a cart) can be ready to go for far less additional price than a projector system.  I used such a system for some 5 years and still use such systems on occasion.  The main drawback of such PC to TV systems is that screen size is usually limited.    Technical Considerations  PC to TV systems, however, have several advantages other than price. The main advantage of such converters is image brightness. TVs can almost always be used in fully lit rooms. This allows students to take notes and read from their own Bibles. One problem with TV’s however, is glare from overhead lights that may reflect off of the glass of the screen.    Older PC to TV converters often required operators to use special software in order to get a good screen image. Modern versions require no extra software and are as simple to operate as plugging one end of the converter into the VGA port on your computer and plugging the other end into the RCA or S-VIDEO port on your TV. Be aware that few converters output to standard cable TV type coax connectors. For a variety of reasons, such output usually doesn’t give a good quality TV picture.  Plan to use a TV with either RCA or S-Video inputs.     Not Just for Class  PC to TV converters have uses other than in the classroom. In a church budget meeting for example, a treasurer can easily share with a small group of decision makers a spreadsheet showing the effects of different spending plans. Those leading home Bible study groups can  integrate the use of their Bible software into their group discussions. This is especially helpful when people involved in the study are not familiar enough with the Bible to know how to look up references. All they have to do to follow a leader with a PC to TV converter is to be able to watch TV! Those leading studies involving class members who have limited English language skills can often find Windows Bible software that will allow them to display two languages in two different windows. A teacher could thus show both English and Spanish translations simultaneously for that kind of mixed language group.   .   Practical Advantages  Churches might be a bit hesitant to check out a $2,000 projector to members for home use but may feel far less restrictive with a $100 converter. Electronic overhead projectors and panels are much larger and often have a lot of cables. Teachers may not want to lug home a bulky overhead projector or try to rearrange their home to set up some kind of projection screen for group Bible studies but may find that plugging in a PC to TV converter is quite convenient.  PC to TV converters are not only small and lightweight but typically are not nearly as fragile as LCD based units.  As more multimedia Bible software becomes available the uses of the computer by the church for education becomes very attractive. With a little imagination church members will find more and more uses for this technology.  PC to TV converters are a good way for churches with limited budgets to get started in using the computer in the small classroom. Churches can easily spend a lot of money on new video or computer technology.  People unfamiliar with the use of multimedia or computers in the classroom may not be supportive of the church expending funds on such items.  PC to TV converters are a cost effective way to demonstrate the use of the new technology to those who are unfamiliar or skeptical of the practical uses of computers in the Bible class.                     WHICH CONVERTER SHOULD I BUY?  A few years ago there weren't very many to chose from but today there is a wide range of selection. Older technology units usually required software to make the converters fully compatible with Windows type software.  Modern units are ""flicker free"", require no additional software and the main controls are located conveniently on the converter.  Some companies even package presentation software and wireless remote controls with their products.  The more expensive units come with a feature called ""Genlock"". Genlock is usually only found on expensive broadcast units and is not needed by the typical teacher.  Genlock is a feature that allows the converter to be used in effectively mixing regular video images from a video camera with the computer and is usually used by those making title screens and text overlays for motion video.  One feature that virtually all converters have is ""overscan"" control.  If you look closely at your TV screen and computer monitor you will notice that they are not the same shape.  The computer screen is a lot wider than it is tall.  The computer image doesn't exactly fit on the TV screen.  The ""overscan"" control allows you to control how you deal with this difference in height to width ratio.  In addition, some converters allow you to ""freeze"" the TV image.  Such converters allow the teacher to put an image on the TV screen, ""freeze"" it and then go back and work on their computer.  The class only sees the last image frozen.  The teacher or their assistant can work on their computer preparing for the next image without disturbing or confusing the class.  This can be very handy when the teacher wants to look up some obscure reference or check some definition.  Matching Capabilities  Some older units you might find on eBay are capable of a few thousand colors but modern units can show millions of colors. Be careful when interpreting such information however, your converter won't be any more powerful than your computer. I once proudly marched into Bible class with a notebook computer and PC to TV converter to display the beautiful million color photos that I had processed on my home desktop computer.  It was more than a little disappointing to find out that the notebook computer I was using was only set to display 16 colors. I told the class to just ""imagine"" the other 15 million colors. It was funny at the time but sure took a lot of punch out of my presentation. No image system can project any better image than you have set your computer to show.    Another time I used a computer set up for an 800 by 600 display but plugged it into an old converter that was only capable of 640 by 480. The result was a jumble of color. I finally ""dumbed"" my notebook computer down to 640 by 480 resolution only to find that in that mode the notebook was not capable of dual screen display. The TV now showed the presentation that I had prepared but the notebook computer screen went blank! Check out all your color and resolution requirements before purchasing your converter. The TV will not give any better image with an 800 by 600 or greater converter but you may loose lots of convenience on the computer side.     Wireless Controls   Be careful also in your expectations of bundled ""image capturing"" software and wireless ""mouse"". Image capturing software can be tricky to use and unless you are willing to buy a top of the line wireless mouse you may be disappointed. A remote control that uses 4 directional buttons to control cursor movements is really more of a handheld wireless keypad. Don't get me wrong. Any kind of wireless control is handy in the classroom but make sure you know what you are getting. Don't expect more than what is advertised.    Some wireless controls come with special software that give you lots of special effects like zoom, highlighting and slide show controls. Several give you marking tools that let you circle and underline text and images for emphasis.  Many of the remotes bundled with PC to TV converters do not act as wireless mice at all but rather simply give you remote control over the converter's functions such as scan control, freeze frame or zoom. Read the specifications of your device carefully so that you won't be disappointed after the sale.  When buying a PC to TV converter make sure to check that its output cables match the TV you are planning to use.  Some units only have RCA output plugs and others may have RF, RCA and S-VHS.  Check your TV or VCR manual for your system.  Many systems are only NTSC compatible so you may not be able to use them overseas.                 Quick Links to Projector Pageses       Introduction to Using Projectors in Church      Why Big Screens in Church       Video Projectors and LCD Overhead Panels      Projectors   - Page Two     PC to TV  Converters       Terry's Tips for Presenters      Most Important                                                                      home  |     top  | updated   January 06, 2009                   Copyright 1999-2009 Terry M.

You can watch and record live TV, view photo slide shows, listen to music, and access Internet movies and music using Windows Media Center. Plugins add even more possibilities.   What makes Windows Media Center different from other Windows media applications is the so-called 10-foot interface.

You get a 15-day free trial to decide how good the program is before you pay for a registration. For what it does it is remarkably inexpensive, costing just $25.00 to license the download version (or $35.00 if you want to order the CD). For that you get a complete music management system that you can use to take control of all of your music files. Music Man uses a very clean task-based interface. Each of the seven available tasks is represented by a tab across the top of the Music Man window. Depending what task you want to do you click the corresponding tab.""
